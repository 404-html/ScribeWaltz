<v Speaker 2>Doesn't versus me.</v>

115
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>No one's perfect at this point in time.</v>

116
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>But what they're trying to do at Ting is just give you an option,</v>

117
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>an option that's easier to swallow and a it's cool company and we enjoy doing</v>

00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:35.801
<v Speaker 2>this is the last one,</v>

123
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God and on it but on it's just a given.</v>

124
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.593
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to make it funny.</v>

125
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>legal zoom.com is our last sponsor,</v>

127
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 2>a legal zoom.com is a website that essentially the,</v>

128
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 2>they lay the framework for legal issues that you would normally have to go to a</v>

129
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 2>lawyer for and pay a lot of money.</v>

130
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 2>and what legal zoom wants to emphasize very clearly is there not a law firm.</v>

132
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 2>They provide self help services at your specific direction and they can also</v>

133
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 2>connect you with an independent attorney if you need additional guidance.</v>

134
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 2>What they are therefore is to make it much easier to do things like incorporate</v>

135
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>or form an LLC.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

165
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

166
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.250
<v Speaker 2>if you live in California,</v>

167
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>her parents live in California.</v>

168
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>California gets all your shit.</v>

169
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Unless your parents breaking in your house and steal everything.</v>

170
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.781
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

171
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the foreign,</v>

173
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 2>he gets all your shit.</v>

174
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I might be 100%</v>

175
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

176
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>but I guess there is a thing if you don't have a will,</v>

177
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.263
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't automate.</v>

178
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 2>You think it just automatically goes to your family.</v>

179
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>But that's not always the case.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

184
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're living with someone,</v>

185
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>like if you're living with a girl or something like that,</v>

186
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>that girl has a key to your house and she knows you're dead and just comes over</v>

00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you know a book.</v>

295
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

296
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm 50 pages into my book.</v>

297
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Or you're in most websites,</v>

298
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>like your pictures and stuff.</v>

299
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's more confusing to most people.</v>

300
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.701
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

301
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm in most weapons.</v>

302
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Most people go to a website,</v>

303
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:47.684
<v Speaker 1>they're not in it.</v>

304
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Well then what do you mean like on it</v>

305
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 1>to do retarded?</v>

306
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you.</v>

307
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm being serious.</v>

308
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to stop saying retarded either.</v>

309
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you tried to take weight training now.</v>

310
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

311
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>That's so hard.</v>

312
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking retard back.</v>

313
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.543
<v Speaker 1>Just some,</v>

314
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting more words back into the vernacular.</v>

315
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

316
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about diseases,</v>

317
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.030
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>

318
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>There's the retarded tranny somewhere going,</v>

319
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

320
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you did the voice on the.com.</v>

321
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

322
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the new prime bells are in a,</v>

323
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen them there,</v>

324
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

325
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 1>we hired this awesome sculptor to draw these angry chimpanzee faces for a kettle</v>

326
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>bells,</v>

327
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>gives you a little bit of extra motivation when you're working out.</v>

329
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I like to picture that chimp clamping down on my scrotum with his teeth.</v>

330
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>That gets me through the last four or five Reps.</v>

331
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

332
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>if you've never used kettlebells before,</v>

333
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>what they are is in my opinion,</v>

334
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the very best strength and conditioning exercise equipment,</v>

335
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>pieces of exercise equipment that you can buy there,</v>

336
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>a Russian invention and it's like a cannon ball with a handle on it.</v>

337
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And he's swinging him around and you use your entire body in these,</v>

338
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

339
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.853
<v Speaker 1>these movements.</v>

340
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And I find that that's what really applies to not just physical,</v>

341
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

342
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

343
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.883
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

344
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>But if just if physical movement,</v>

345
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
<v Speaker 1>physical movement,</v>

346
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>like I'm picking things up,</v>

347
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>the ability to move stuff around your house,</v>

348
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

349
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

350
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 1>you gain a balance sort of strength.</v>

351
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a lot of people,</v>

352
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems with people who,</v>

353
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

354
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>don't use a professional trainer or don't exactly know what you're doing.</v>

355
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>You can develop imbalances,</v>

356
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

357
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>with your body because maybe you use your arms too much.</v>

358
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't use your legs enough or vice verse and it can be,</v>

359
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.013
<v Speaker 1>it can be a mess.</v>

360
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

361
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things you can do if you're going to think,</v>

362
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about kettle bells or any kind of exercise thing is to hire</v>

363
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really good,</v>

364
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>who can show you what to do.</v>

365
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot of stuff from youtube,</v>

366
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but you really should have someone sort of correcting subtle things in the way</v>

367
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:46.734
<v Speaker 1>you're moving,</v>

368
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>just to make sure that you have good form.</v>

369
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Use a lightweight to begin with,</v>

370
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>try to try to be very reasonable about what you're trying to do and then build,</v>

371
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.111
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

372
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You're right it down and build.</v>

373
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>And when you do do that,</v>

374
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you will get an immense set sense of satisfaction.</v>

375
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 1>The sense of satisfaction that you get from pushing your body and getting your</v>

376
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>body into a good state of physical fitness.</v>

377
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a vanity thing,</v>

378
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:10.110
<v Speaker 1>it's really good for your health.</v>

379
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

380
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I talk about it all the time,</v>

382
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's very hard for people to stop eating donuts and get off the couch.</v>

383
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to choose to have a salad instead of a shitty cheeseburger.</v>

384
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.413
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

385
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get your shit together.</v>

386
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you can get your shit together even just a little bit,</v>

387
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.693
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel better.</v>

388
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

389
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I lost eight pounds in two weeks.</v>

390
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.953
<v Speaker 1>Have you really?</v>

391
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's after quitting smoking,</v>

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And I was surprised to discover it.</v>

439
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It has the most syllables of any organization in</v>

440
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 3>the nonprofit world for drug reform</v>

441
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.303
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

442
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

443
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting title,</v>

444
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.</v>

445
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about it.</v>

446
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're coming at it from a whole bunch of different angles.</v>

447
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So as he just doctors,</v>

448
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not just chemists,</v>

449
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole bunch of human beings.</v>

450
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:13.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

451
00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:17.820
<v Speaker 3>And I had learned from a previous nonprofit that when you want to create a</v>

452
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:18.481
<v Speaker 3>nonprofit,</v>

453
00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:21.780
<v Speaker 3>it's good to try to make it as broad as possible.</v>

454
00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:25.140
<v Speaker 3>The purpose as you see different strategic ways to do things.</v>

455
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.200
<v Speaker 3>So I made it multidisciplinary,</v>

456
00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:32.250
<v Speaker 3>which means we could look at psychedelics from virtually any perspective,</v>

457
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

458
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.050
<v Speaker 3>association to mean that it's publicly supported a nonprofit.</v>

459
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:38.250
<v Speaker 3>And I had images of,</v>

460
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

461
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.630
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of people banding together to support research in different</v>

462
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:43.464
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

463
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

464
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.550
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic was a big choice,</v>

465
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:47.911
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

466
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:49.170
<v Speaker 3>whether we should use the word,</v>

467
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.700
<v Speaker 3>whether we should use a different word,</v>

468
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>whether we should use a euphemism.</v>

469
00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 3>And so I felt like I wanted in this kind of second coming of psychedelics into</v>

470
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:05.010
<v Speaker 3>the culture 40 years after the crackdown that I wanted there to be a certain</v>

471
00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 3>transparency.</v>

472
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.140
<v Speaker 3>And so I wanted to use the word psychedelics so people knew what I was doing and</v>

473
00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:14.910
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping that we can change the cultural connotations from what it was in</v>

474
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:16.590
<v Speaker 3>the 60s of psychedelics,</v>

475
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:16.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

476
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.730
<v Speaker 3>rebellion,</v>

477
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.690
<v Speaker 3>dropping out,</v>

478
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

479
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

480
00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>finding your own sort of private utopia somewhere,</v>

481
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.481
<v Speaker 3>certain kind of,</v>

482
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:25.314
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

483
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.810
<v Speaker 3>not integrated into the culture.</v>

484
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.100
<v Speaker 3>And now that's,</v>

485
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:34.101
<v Speaker 3>I think the arc of the story is psychedelics came at a time when culture wasn't</v>

486
00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:37.260
<v Speaker 3>really ready and brought all sorts of things to the surface.</v>

487
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And over the last 40 years,</v>

488
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>our culture has gotten ready with hospice centers,</v>

489
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:43.230
<v Speaker 3>with birthing centers,</v>

490
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.190
<v Speaker 3>with Yoga,</v>

491
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:44.851
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>

492
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:46.500
<v Speaker 3>all the things with flotation tanks,</v>

493
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:50.010
<v Speaker 3>all the things that were too hard to integrate at the time,</v>

494
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 3>death and birth and just raw emotions that,</v>

495
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Speaker 3>and also this globalization and growing sense of global spirituality.</v>

496
00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Now our culture is ready and I think we can over the next 10 20 years integrates</v>

497
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:05.640
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics without the connotation of rebellion.</v>

498
00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:07.500
<v Speaker 3>But to enhance what we're all doing together.</v>

499
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.561
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

500
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I like the use of the word psycho dogs cause you're owning it and that is what</v>

501
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it's about and you know,</v>

502
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:13.991
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

503
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's shouldn't be something that people are afraid of or afraid of adding to</v>

504
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>something because it'll somehow or another make it silly or make it,</v>

505
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>oh psychedelics.</v>

506
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:23.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

507
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>people want to dismiss it and they can much easier.</v>

508
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Owning it is,</v>

509
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.420
<v Speaker 1>is I think is very important.</v>

510
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's no other word that's even better.</v>

511
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:31.781
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

512
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Hallucinogen was used by the government.</v>

513
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're fake.</v>

514
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

515
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that feeling either.</v>

516
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Hallucinogen always makes me feel like I'm seeing something that's not there.</v>

517
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:40.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

518
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:41.491
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea.</v>

519
00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:41.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not real and don't know anything about psychedelics.</v>

521
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 1>They imagined like literally like imagining someone in the room with you and</v>

522
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

523
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really exist.</v>

524
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 4>The word before that in the 50s was even worse.</v>

525
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 4>It was psycho.</v>

526
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.124
<v Speaker 4>My medic.</v>

527
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

528
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Which means it mimic psychosis.</v>

529
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:02.811
<v Speaker 4>Well it doesn't.</v>

530
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Some people should be careful.</v>

531
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.343
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

532
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 4>It does bring in all parts of ourselves.</v>

533
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I think we all have those kind of parts where they're not really integrated and</v>

534
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:17.081
<v Speaker 4>it seems extreme and you let the emotions carry you so that the safe place we</v>

535
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 4>have to be careful I think is true.</v>

536
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 4>But the bad trip,</v>

537
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 4>the difficult challenge,</v>

538
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:22.671
<v Speaker 4>the death rebirth,</v>

539
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 4>it's in all of us as are these psychotic states.</v>

540
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:25.631
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

541
00:15:25.631 --> 00:15:30.631
<v Speaker 4>I actually had what I felt was probably the most psychotic or diluted state of</v>

542
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 4>my whole life was doing LSD and a flotation tank.</v>

543
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.023
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

544
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 4>I can imagine.</v>

545
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.410
<v Speaker 4>So self examine story.</v>

546
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.253
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

547
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.213
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

548
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an LSD person.</v>

549
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 4>I never have tried it because I've never trusted anybody in the right way to get</v>

550
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

551
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.430
<v Speaker 4>But I've done a lot of time in the tank on especially on high doses of edibles,</v>

552
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.363
<v Speaker 4>edible weed,</v>

553
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 4>that insanely uncomfortable feeling that you get.</v>

554
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Will you get,</v>

555
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 4>you could examine story about shit you did in high school.</v>

556
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Like really in depth.</v>

557
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

558
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 4>In high school.</v>

559
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.053
<v Speaker 4>Good for yeah.</v>

560
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 4>And the tank does that on its own.</v>

561
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 4>So the tank with that together,</v>

562
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:07.121
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

563
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

564
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>

565
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

566
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Well imagine acid in the tank would be a similar experience.</v>

567
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

568
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Well I grew up reading John Lilly in the 1971,</v>

569
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:16.484
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

570
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 4>but it was before that was programming and Meta programming and the human bio</v>

571
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:22.694
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>

572
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 4>And that was so technical and complicated.</v>

573
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 4>I had to spend like a whole day on each page or something that just like cam at</v>

574
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 4>figure this stuff out.</v>

575
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 4>It was so early computer discussion,</v>

576
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.990
<v Speaker 4>discussion and language about and how the brain in that parades,</v>

577
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

578
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 4>He was a real pioneer.</v>

579
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Like a real pioneer.</v>

580
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean that dude was out there.</v>

581
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

582
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 4>But he went too far out and he wasn't grounded in his last,</v>

583
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

584
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.431
<v Speaker 4>30 years.</v>

585
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:47.870
<v Speaker 4>We're kind of a sad tragedy,</v>

586
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

587
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Wasted potential.</v>

588
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

589
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 4>it was that because of ketamine,</v>

590
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 4>cause he got involved heavily with Ketamine,</v>

591
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 4>which has some pretty disastrous results.</v>

592
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

593
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Ketamine is the most addictive of all the psychedelics and I physically</v>

594
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:01.754
<v Speaker 4>addictive,</v>

595
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 4>not so much physically,</v>

596
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.491
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

597
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 4>but more this,</v>

598
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 4>a reliable escape that and this delusion of superiority.</v>

599
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 4>So was their withdrawal.</v>

600
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in that same way as heroin or it's not like physically it's just a</v>

601
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 4>psychological addiction more so there's a shift in the attitude and,</v>

602
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 4>but what I think was the problem with John Lilly more than before,</v>

603
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 4>the ketamine was a certain kind of brilliance that was unbalanced and he was</v>

604
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 4>kind of arrogant and I don't think he was patient and he was way ahead of his</v>

605
00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.154
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

606
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

607
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:38.414
<v Speaker 4>way ahead.</v>

608
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 4>And yet when he saw the crackdown calm,</v>

609
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 4>I think he,</v>

610
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 4>he sort of took this superior position and just felt like he's not going to work</v>

611
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:49.034
<v Speaker 4>on a</v>

612
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 3>political struggle or even a scientific struggle to get these tools back.</v>

613
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 3>He kind of withdrew.</v>

614
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.240
<v Speaker 3>And even from boy he just had this um,</v>

615
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 3>somewhat self destructive aspect too.</v>

616
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 3>I read a lot about him and I met him and I actually ended up,</v>

617
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do Mtma therapy with him when it felt like he was really going</v>

618
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:18.750
<v Speaker 3>downhill from the ketamine and from cocaine and wow.</v>

619
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

620
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 3>that's intense is the word is kind of my hero.</v>

621
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 3>One of he and Stan Grof,</v>

622
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.610
<v Speaker 3>and I would contrast them that Stan is doing fantastically as traveling.</v>

623
00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 3>The world is totally together and a major inspiration who is able to integrate</v>

624
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.214
<v Speaker 3>into his life.</v>

625
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Whereas John Lilly was,</v>

626
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you could say arguably as brilliant but went off the track.</v>

627
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

628
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

629
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>it is possible.</v>

630
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the real issues with anything that completely alters the way your</v>

631
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>mind works is that you could get into that too much.</v>

632
00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:53.020
<v Speaker 1>She can get into that more than reality and lose your grip of this one.</v>

633
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

634
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:54.520
<v Speaker 3>it is reality.</v>

635
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different view of reality.</v>

636
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.653
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

637
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.390
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the grounding part and what we emphasize in our psychedelic</v>

638
00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:06.391
<v Speaker 3>therapy is that it's the integration work more than the experience itself that</v>

639
00:19:07.241 --> 00:19:08.740
<v Speaker 3>produces longterm benefits.</v>

640
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.230
<v Speaker 3>So then you can have these unusual experiences,</v>

641
00:19:11.231 --> 00:19:16.231
<v Speaker 3>but what do you bring back from them and how do you integrate that into your</v>

642
00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:20.020
<v Speaker 3>daily practices so that it's anchored so that you can try to get there without</v>

643
00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:20.854
<v Speaker 3>the drug.</v>

644
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like this evolution process where you learn something.</v>

645
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.171
<v Speaker 3>And I've found,</v>

646
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:27.100
<v Speaker 3>at least for me,</v>

647
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelics are something that I can work with through a lifetime,</v>

648
00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:32.410
<v Speaker 3>through a lifespan that I've learned.</v>

649
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Some people say when you get the message,</v>

650
00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:35.380
<v Speaker 3>hang up the phone.</v>

651
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.880
<v Speaker 3>And I felt that there's been different messages at different stages of my life</v>

652
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 3>and that I'm more able,</v>

653
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.440
<v Speaker 3>although it's still really hard,</v>

654
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

655
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.760
<v Speaker 3>to hear those things,</v>

656
00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:49.030
<v Speaker 3>those the self critical stuff like what he did in high school or what,</v>

657
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:49.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

658
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:54.640
<v Speaker 3>how you try to hear the message underneath the criticism.</v>

659
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

660
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I learned that a lot during an Ibogaine experience.</v>

661
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.880
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen that these experiences can have these lasting changes,</v>

662
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.350
<v Speaker 3>but that they don't always,</v>

663
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:06.280
<v Speaker 3>and they don't have to.</v>

664
00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:09.760
<v Speaker 3>And particularly when you had these experiences that are unbalanced,</v>

665
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Speaker 3>the drug starts wearing off and you haven't come to a new balance.</v>

666
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.310
<v Speaker 3>And during those periods,</v>

667
00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:20.311
<v Speaker 3>the best solution at least is to continue therapy and do another session.</v>

668
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's where people often back off and they kind of free something in place</v>

669
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.860
<v Speaker 3>that's at such a deep level.</v>

670
00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:29.980
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get to that deep level to move it forward.</v>

671
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

672
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

673
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

674
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a very personal thing,</v>

675
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

676
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Like where you start from to,</v>

677
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 1>for some folks it's like they've already,</v>

679
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>they already have issues with reality itself.</v>

680
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 1>They have issues with being grounded,</v>

681
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:45.420
<v Speaker 1>with being calm.</v>

682
00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's some people you could just,</v>

683
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:49.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you could just get them high or they could have some sort of psychedelic</v>

685
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 1>experience and they would be able to assimilate it into their life and they</v>

686
00:20:58.151 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>would benefit from it almost immediately.</v>

687
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Whereas other folks almost needed to be.</v>

688
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I think education is one of the big ones that were really lacking in this</v>

689
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:07.930
<v Speaker 1>country when it comes to these things.</v>

690
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And the word Shaman is such a,</v>

691
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>such a loaded word because it's like healer,</v>

692
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 1>when someone says their healer,</v>

694
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:15.950
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you,</v>

695
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.411
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

696
00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

697
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:17.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:18.181
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

699
00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>what other dumb shit or you're going to say next,</v>

700
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 3>are hollow therapeutic approaches based on the idea that there's an inner healer</v>

702
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's the support that we provide to help people heal themselves.</v>

703
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 3>So there's a power dynamic often in shamanism where sometimes the shaman is even</v>

704
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the only one that does the drug and then heels you.</v>

705
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

706
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not teaching you how to heal yourself so that we have this idea that like</v>

707
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 3>the body heals itself.</v>

708
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 3>If you get a cut that the psyche has these self healing mechanisms and brings</v>

709
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:54.421
<v Speaker 3>things kind of to the surface so that it's not so much reality and psychedelic</v>

710
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:55.061
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

711
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like reality and more reality.</v>

712
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 3>And we know that from a Fmri brain scan studies that were recently done in</v>

713
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 3>England with Psilocybin,</v>

714
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 3>that what it does in the brain is different than what we had been thinking and</v>

715
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.580
<v Speaker 3>we had been thinking that it makes the brain speed up,</v>

716
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Speaker 3>that that you know,</v>

717
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 3>some things work even faster that,</v>

718
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 3>that your perceptions are going.</v>

719
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 3>And actually what it does is it makes parts of the brain slow down,</v>

720
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's the filtering parts of the brain so that we have enormous volume of</v>

721
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 3>perceptions coming to us at any one time.</v>

722
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of what you can see in the tank to that when you start quieting</v>

723
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 3>everything down,</v>

724
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.464
<v Speaker 3>you can really,</v>

725
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

726
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 3>think in different ways.</v>

727
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 3>But we have this enormous amount of information and we only narrow and look at</v>

728
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.990
<v Speaker 3>some of it what we need to do either for survival,</v>

729
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.040
<v Speaker 3>for we focus and the controlling the filtering parts of the brain are what</v>

730
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin slows down so that they work less well.</v>

731
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 3>So you get more of a flood of what's already there.</v>

732
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.730
<v Speaker 1>What is the mechanism,</v>

733
00:22:59.731 --> 00:23:01.160
<v Speaker 1>the filtering parts of the brand.</v>

734
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>When you say the filter in parts of the brand,</v>

735
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:02.861
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

736
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:03.694
<v Speaker 1>what are those?</v>

737
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.113
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

738
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.140
<v Speaker 3>they're generally linkedin,</v>

739
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.720
<v Speaker 3>what's called the default network,</v>

740
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.460
<v Speaker 3>the default mode network.</v>

741
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.110
<v Speaker 3>There's um,</v>

742
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and here becomes kind of a practical side of the work that I do,</v>

743
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.630
<v Speaker 3>which is basically trying to develop a psychedelic drugs into prescription</v>

744
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:25.410
<v Speaker 3>medicines and marijuana.</v>

745
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 3>So from the FDAS point of view,</v>

746
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

747
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.570
<v Speaker 3>you have to show something safe and efficacious,</v>

748
00:23:30.571 --> 00:23:32.700
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to explain how it works.</v>

749
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.780
<v Speaker 3>So therefore,</v>

750
00:23:33.781 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really focused on that.</v>

751
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:35.281
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

752
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to your question because,</v>

753
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

754
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:44.030
<v Speaker 3>it's neuroscience and I don't need neuroscience to know the exact quadrants,</v>

755
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.411
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

756
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>So I've kind</v>

757
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.843
<v Speaker 4>of got,</v>

758
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.923
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

759
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.960
<v Speaker 4>people I work with and other people I rely on another scientist to do that part.</v>

760
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 4>It helps if you have an explanatory mechanism,</v>

761
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time it's not necessary.</v>

762
00:23:58.281 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 4>So what I've done is tried to be strategic and tried to focus on the stuff</v>

763
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 4>that's essential to move the culture forward,</v>

764
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 4>to create legal context for psychedelics to show that they can be used</v>

765
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 4>responsibly.</v>

766
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Why is asking more for my own edification?</v>

767
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:11.820
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could answer you.</v>

768
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:12.931
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>

769
00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:13.280
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

770
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 4>I think I read that very study about quieting areas of mine.</v>

771
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was really fascinating and um,</v>

772
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I attributed it to uh,</v>

773
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

774
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 4>the idea being that we are filled with noise.</v>

775
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.401
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

776
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.410
<v Speaker 4>that our mind is filled with noise.</v>

777
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Our mind is filled with concentrating on a bunch of shit that's not really</v>

778
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:38.381
<v Speaker 4>important and that that gets shut off and then you can sort of tune in to</v>

779
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:41.140
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is that you took and uh,</v>

780
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that you took that's doing something and yeah,</v>

781
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't see it so much.</v>

782
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 4>That stuff is not important,</v>

783
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as important.</v>

784
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

785
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 4>you need to do certain things to get through the day,</v>

786
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 4>so you need to have a narrower focus.</v>

787
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not important.</v>

788
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't even what I should've said.</v>

789
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.410
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

790
00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 4>it's not that it's unimportant,</v>

791
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 4>it's just sometimes there are things in your life that aren't that important,</v>

792
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.530
<v Speaker 4>but they take primary focus,</v>

793
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 4>they take center stage,</v>

794
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:06.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

795
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:07.720
<v Speaker 4>whether it's an argument that we,</v>

796
00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 4>you got with a friend over almost nothing.</v>

797
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Something that can be addressed,</v>

798
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

799
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 4>really easily and quickly probably.</v>

800
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But whatever it is,</v>

801
00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 4>it's bothering you.</v>

802
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Should I say something because I really feel like I'm being slighted and no fuck</v>

803
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 4>with you all day until you actually have the conversation with the person.</v>

804
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 4>And it can be a million other things.</v>

805
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Could it be financial issues that you have?</v>

806
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Could be something's wrong with your house and you have to pay to get it fixed.</v>

807
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 4>And all these things just constantly chip away at your ability to focus on the</v>

808
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 4>now and to enjoy,</v>

809
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

810
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 4>just to enjoy the experience of life itself.</v>

811
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

812
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 4>I've never really felt comfortable kind of meditating to try to let all those</v>

813
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 4>things go because I get into this state where I have this idea of something</v>

814
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 4>should I do,</v>

815
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.401
<v Speaker 4>I should do.</v>

816
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think those things that you mentioned are really important.</v>

817
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 4>How you relate to your friends.</v>

818
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Those are words,</v>

819
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 4>those are the most important things of life.</v>

820
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Not that at least important,</v>

821
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 4>but I've always felt like when I'm,</v>

822
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 4>if I were to be meditating,</v>

823
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 4>this idea will come up and I'm supposed to just let it go.</v>

824
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.341
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

825
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 4>why don't I just do it?</v>

826
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm more outer focused in,</v>

827
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:09.614
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

828
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.573
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

829
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

830
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 4>jogging and being stoned are like meditation.</v>

831
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.081
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

832
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely the meditation.</v>

833
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

834
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.451
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

835
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 4>Jogging stone is a trip.</v>

836
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 4>It's very different than,</v>

837
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 4>than just exercising.</v>

838
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

839
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 4>Fight.</v>

840
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

841
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 4>but I think that this idea of creating a space like in the tank or like a</v>

842
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>therapeutic setting where you're not paying attention to all those daily things</v>

843
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 4>where you can sink deeper to,</v>

844
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.493
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

845
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.210
<v Speaker 4>other questions of life that that is really important.</v>

846
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You have to kind of consciously create a space for that.</v>

847
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:41.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

848
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.090
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

849
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 4>the things that always up in trips,</v>

850
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

851
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.450
<v Speaker 1>for me that they're,</v>

852
00:26:46.451 --> 00:26:46.591
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

853
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>the uncomfortable things are always things that I really should be working on</v>

854
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

855
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>

856
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've hit an imbalance and I focus too much on this and not enough on that</v>

857
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:56.441
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

858
00:26:56.441 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>

859
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

860
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 1>those moments where it hits you,</v>

861
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like you should've known that anyway.</v>

862
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

863
00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:03.781
<v Speaker 1>if you knew,</v>

864
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>if you were living in a harmonious way,</v>

865
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.990
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have to tell you this.</v>

866
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:07.291
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

867
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 1>so get it over with.</v>

868
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:08.994
<v Speaker 1>Figure that out.</v>

869
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And every trip that I've had that,</v>

870
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

871
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>where that's happened,</v>

872
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they've only been a few of them that are really liberal,</v>

873
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 1>like super uncomfortable,</v>

874
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>just really bad.</v>

875
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:17.971
<v Speaker 1>But those always,</v>

876
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I benefited from those,</v>

877
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.371
<v Speaker 1>every one of them.</v>

878
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:20.521
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

879
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by bad?</v>

880
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean bad.</v>

881
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

882
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

883
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

884
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.780
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable like especially with the eating,</v>

885
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 1>eating marijuana,</v>

886
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 1>the eating marijuana thing.</v>

887
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 1>A lot of folks do not give that the proper respect and that's why they freak out</v>

889
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.774
<v Speaker 1>and call the cops.</v>

890
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 1>If I'm sure you heard the great video of the police officers who stole marijuana</v>

891
00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 1>from someone they pulled over and then made pot brownies and then got so high</v>

892
00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 1>they panicked and called the police.</v>

893
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They call the ambulance,</v>

894
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 1>call the ambulance.</v>

895
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Speaker 1>He was saying right there.</v>

896
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard that before,</v>

897
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

898
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

899
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:54.954
<v Speaker 1>we played it on here.</v>

900
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.030
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

901
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 1>He played it.</v>

902
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>

903
00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Play it just for the goof.</v>

904
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

905
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 1>These poor people,</v>

906
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know these,</v>

907
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 1>these dirty cops is that marijuana and when it's processed by your liver,</v>

908
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.021
<v Speaker 1>when you eat it,</v>

909
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 1>it's produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite and incredibly psychoactive</v>

910
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:11.851
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

911
00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the THC high at all.</v>

912
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different experience in much stronger.</v>

913
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a lot of people think that like the aide cookie,</v>

914
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 1>that it was laced like,</v>

915
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:21.361
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

916
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So when he lays this was something,</v>

917
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I know you're taking a totally different drug.</v>

918
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:26.711

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1015
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Why is that funny?</v>

1016
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.471
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why.</v>

1017
00:30:54.471 --> 00:30:55.970
<v Speaker 4>It's funny cause he can't die from it.</v>

1018
00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:00.560
<v Speaker 4>The only way pots going to kill you is if you take 25 pounds and he dropped it</v>

1019
00:31:00.561 --> 00:31:03.020
<v Speaker 4>off of a CIA drug plain and it lands in your head.</v>

1020
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.310
<v Speaker 4>That's how pots going to kill you.</v>

1021
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 4>You could probably get a heart attack.</v>

1022
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 4>A good movie could kill you if that's the case.</v>

1023
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.610
<v Speaker 4>You Pussy.</v>

1024
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 4>The other question is why did they think they would die and it's not just</v>

1026
00:31:17.361 --> 00:31:22.100
<v Speaker 4>because their heart was racing or things like that that the judgment day it's,</v>

1027
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 4>well it's like these feel during parts of the brain that the pie when you eat it</v>

1028
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:27.231
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1029
00:31:27.231 --> 00:31:28.460
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of very powerful.</v>

1030
00:31:28.461 --> 00:31:31.700
<v Speaker 4>It is like tripping code and so your sense of who you are.</v>

1031
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.900
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty logical.</v>

1032
00:31:32.901 --> 00:31:34.700
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty good at answering the questions.</v>

1033
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.290
<v Speaker 4>He had some problems.</v>

1034
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.124
<v Speaker 4>So some of that,</v>

1035
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 4>but I think people confuse ego death with physical death and ego,</v>

1036
00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:46.880
<v Speaker 4>death of letting go of who your narrow sense of who you are and opening up into</v>

1037
00:31:46.881 --> 00:31:47.900
<v Speaker 4>something very scary.</v>

1038
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.220
<v Speaker 4>And so people have defenses and they converted into,</v>

1039
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm dying because it feels like that you,</v>

1040
00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:57.440
<v Speaker 4>that you is dying in a way.</v>

1041
00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:58.401
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

1042
00:31:58.401 --> 00:31:58.701
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1043
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:02.600
<v Speaker 4>don't you think also he's just fucking panicking and thinking that he overdosed</v>

1044
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:04.760
<v Speaker 4>on a drug and just shitting his pants?</v>

1045
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 4>I can maybe not even an ego death.</v>

1046
00:32:06.621 --> 00:32:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Just absolute fear of the fact that you don't know what the hell was in there</v>

1047
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:10.931
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

1048
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:11.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1049
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.200
<v Speaker 4>he knows he made it.</v>

1050
00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:12.741
<v Speaker 4>It was pot.</v>

1051
00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:13.580
<v Speaker 4>He knew what it was.</v>

1052
00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:16.290
<v Speaker 4>He just got taken by surprise how strong it was.</v>

1053
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 4>But he said he doesn't know if there's anything in it.</v>

1054
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1055
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.360
<v Speaker 4>it's what you said right before,</v>

1056
00:32:20.361 --> 00:32:23.030
<v Speaker 4>as people start thinking it was laced with something that it's not.</v>

1057
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:23.481
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1058
00:32:23.481 --> 00:32:23.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1059
00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:25.310
<v Speaker 4>I think the guy thought he was dying.</v>

1060
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.193
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1061
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was dying on weed before I caught it.</v>

1062
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Really physically if that you're dying.</v>

1063
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.970
<v Speaker 4>it'd be because I had something in my life,</v>

1065
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.040
<v Speaker 4>I always thought it had something wrong with my heart,</v>

1066
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1067
00:32:37.431 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 4>so I had,</v>

1068
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1069
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>like as a kid would pass out</v>

1070
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 2>and black out and just like fall to the ground.</v>

1071
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I had to take the stress test as like an eight year old kid.</v>

1072
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1073
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1074
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>

1075
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 2>running on the treadmill and stuff.</v>

1076
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1077
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 2>they could never find out what happened,</v>

1078
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:49.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 2>then it would happen again like four years later.</v>

1080
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>So like growing up,</v>

1081
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I always had this thing like,</v>

1082
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:54.231
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1083
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad Boone heart type shit.</v>

1084
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:56.071
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1085
00:32:56.071 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a broken heart or there's something with a valve that they just</v>

1086
00:32:59.481 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 2>haven't detected.</v>

1087
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.390
<v Speaker 2>And so when I smoked too much weed,</v>

1088
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I immediately thought I felt my heart and I'm like,</v>

1089
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:04.791
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1090
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 2>my heart is fucked up.</v>

1091
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1092
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that the weed was killing me,</v>

1093
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 2>but it might be doing something to what I already thought I had a problem with</v>

1094
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:13.491
<v Speaker 2>my heart already,</v>

1095
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:13.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:14.564
<v Speaker 2>type thing.</v>

1097
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1098
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 2>you were panicking like a little bitch.</v>

1099
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:17.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:33:17.881 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 2>When you thought you were going to die.</v>

1101
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.560
<v Speaker 2>When you hear,</v>

1102
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.500
<v Speaker 2>when you feel your heart double beat,</v>

1103
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you know when it just like bup up,</v>

1104
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:24.931
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1105
00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:25.061
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1106
00:33:25.061 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1107
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:25.570
<v Speaker 2>pump,</v>

1108
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.690
<v Speaker 2>you know that starts doing shit like that.</v>

1109
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 2>You certainly mind fuck yourself.</v>

1110
00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.843
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1112
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you had that thing though.</v>

1113
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that you blacked out.</v>

1114
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I blacked out five times in my life.</v>

1115
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1116
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1117
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 2>and they've tried everything.</v>

1118
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:39.920
<v Speaker 2>They've done tons of tests.</v>

1119
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1120
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's only been like the last maybe five years.</v>

1121
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I just don't give a shit about that anymore.</v>

1122
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:45.930
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1123
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happens and I don't ever get panic attacks anymore anxiety</v>

1124
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:49.791
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1125
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:50.870
<v Speaker 2>It just went away.</v>

1126
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been using a lot Molly lately,</v>

1127
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:53.324
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that's why</v>

1128
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1129
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 2>you probably look good evidence for my therapy.</v>

1130
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe in that a million times over storms or anything,</v>

1131
00:34:02.961 --> 00:34:06.650
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're with a loved one and there's definitely something minute.</v>

1132
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think over,</v>

1133
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a competition or a race.</v>

1134
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I think they all have their own little impact.</v>

1135
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about psychedelic medicine,</v>

1136
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic spirituality,</v>

1137
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.720
<v Speaker 3>and it's the whole range of drugs at different times at different places.</v>

1138
00:34:19.721 --> 00:34:20.110
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1139
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:20.943
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>

1140
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.440
<v Speaker 2>The other thing about psychedelics is it can,</v>

1141
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of states that can be achieved naturally and I think in the</v>

1142
00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:31.480
<v Speaker 2>pursuit of a psychedelics as a discipline,</v>

1143
00:34:31.481 --> 00:34:31.811
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1144
00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:34.600
<v Speaker 2>as something just to truly legitimately study.</v>

1145
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that they're going to open up is what yoga does to the</v>

1146
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:39.304
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1147
00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Yoga does something,</v>

1149
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.590
<v Speaker 2>they're intense.</v>

1150
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Come on Brian Class,</v>

1151

1155
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:51.790
<v Speaker 2>if you take a really strong yoga class and you get through it,</v>

1156
00:34:51.791 --> 00:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>you feel like your high</v>

1157
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1158
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.833
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1160
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I am aware of friends,</v>

1161
00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 3>longterm yoga practitioners,</v>

1162
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 3>long term meditators who have found that it's not either or that you can,</v>

1163
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.900
<v Speaker 3>when you're practiced in these ways too,</v>

1164
00:35:06.901 --> 00:35:08.730
<v Speaker 3>that you can have a psychedelic experience.</v>

1165
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:11.070
<v Speaker 3>You can go to a deeper place and then you can work,</v>

1166
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.310
<v Speaker 3>you have a better sense of where you want to be and you can work sometimes for</v>

1167
00:35:14.311 --> 00:35:16.830
<v Speaker 3>years to grounded and integrated.</v>

1168
00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:17.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1169
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.890
<v Speaker 3>it's this flow back and forth.</v>

1170
00:35:19.891 --> 00:35:24.750
<v Speaker 3>So I think the overreliance on psychedelics can prove to be harmful because</v>

1171
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing the integration or with John Lilly,</v>

1172
00:35:27.871 --> 00:35:28.920
<v Speaker 3>you're escaping,</v>

1173
00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you'll stay somehow or other,</v>

1174
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:33.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1175
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.460
<v Speaker 3>pure and do things all on your own,</v>

1176
00:35:35.461 --> 00:35:36.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain kind of,</v>

1177
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1178
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 3>slowness or egotism about that.</v>

1179
00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:40.851
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1180
00:35:40.851 --> 00:35:41.684
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1181
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1182
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate to admit sometimes that we need physical catalysts.</v>

1183
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>We need help.</v>

1184
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 3>We need tools.</v>

1185
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes our defenses are so strong.</v>

1186
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1187
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's an either or situation.</v>

1188
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.050
<v Speaker 7>I don't think there's anything we,</v>

1189
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.961
<v Speaker 7>for whatever reason,</v>

1190
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 7>we have this idea in our head that taking something to get somewhere as a</v>

1191
00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:58.764
<v Speaker 7>weakness.</v>

1192
00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.131
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1193
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of people that believe that,</v>

1194
00:36:00.671 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 7>that taking a drug to achieve a state like,</v>

1195
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:04.051
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1196
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 7>you can't deal with reality.</v>

1197
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.290
<v Speaker 7>You're weak,</v>

1198
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.670
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1199
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1200
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.673
<v Speaker 3>There is that.</v>

1201
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 3>But then you switch it to cars.</v>

1202
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd take a car to get psych suck a plane and a car to get here.</v>

1203
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:14.780
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:14.931
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1205
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:16.280
<v Speaker 7>you could definitely look at it that way.</v>

1206
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.140
<v Speaker 7>I just think the,</v>

1207
00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:21.710
<v Speaker 7>the idea is very strange when we know that,</v>

1208
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.550
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1209
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

1210
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.330
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

1211
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:28.330
<v Speaker 7>our bodies are these weird biological machines that were constantly feeding</v>

1212
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.720
<v Speaker 7>different things too.</v>

1213
00:36:29.721 --> 00:36:32.510
<v Speaker 7>We're constantly giving a different kinds of nutrients.</v>

1214
00:36:32.511 --> 00:36:34.850
<v Speaker 7>We experiment with the diets,</v>

1215
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:37.880
<v Speaker 7>we experiment in our carbohydrate balance and our protein,</v>

1216
00:36:37.881 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 7>but we experiment with all these different things.</v>

1217
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.720
<v Speaker 7>But when it comes to taking a plant,</v>

1218
00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 7>especially something like mushrooms sets,</v>

1219
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.800
<v Speaker 7>we've documented many thousands of years of use and to decide all of a sudden</v>

1220
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.040
<v Speaker 7>that this is a weakness and that this is,</v>

1221
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.581
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1222
00:36:52.581 --> 00:36:57.581
<v Speaker 7>just unnecessary in society as if our society is perfect in every way.</v>

1223
00:36:57.651 --> 00:36:58.550
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

1224
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.121
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1225
00:36:59.121 --> 00:37:01.400
<v Speaker 7>no need for self examination here at all.</v>

1226
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1227
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:06.280
<v Speaker 3>well we're actually an anomaly as far as society goes cause most of them have,</v>

1228
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1229
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.430
<v Speaker 3>the use of drugs,</v>

1230
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:14.020
<v Speaker 3>the use of altered states in some kind of sanctioned manner.</v>

1231
00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:18.550
<v Speaker 3>It's repressed and prohibited throughout our lifetimes.</v>

1232
00:37:18.551 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 3>We kind of have a sense that maybe that's the way it's been large parts of human</v>

1233
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:22.841
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1234
00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:24.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's not been that way.</v>

1235
00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:29.350
<v Speaker 3>They're encased in a religious rituals or different kind of cultural context.</v>

1236
00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:31.750
<v Speaker 3>But they're not prohibited and they're respected.</v>

1237
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's where we've lost touch with that.</v>

1238
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 3>And there's so much coming from people finding it on their own through various</v>

1239
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.240
<v Speaker 3>methods that the culture is changing.</v>

1240
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.020
<v Speaker 7>I think it's definitely changing.</v>

1241
00:37:45.021 --> 00:37:50.021
<v Speaker 7>And I think what's really crazy is that the people who are suppressing</v>

1242
00:37:51.831 --> 00:37:52.551
<v Speaker 7>psychedelics,</v>

1243
00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 7>that people who seek to suppressant are the ones need them more than anybody.</v>

1244
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.801
<v Speaker 3>Well exactly.</v>

1245
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:58.630
<v Speaker 3>So our study right now that we're doing,</v>

1246
00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:02.020
<v Speaker 3>and again the with Mtma for posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

1247
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.250
<v Speaker 3>I owe it to the point to Brian,</v>

1248
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you're the poster boy kid revelations,</v>

1249
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.360
<v Speaker 3>just the first one for tonight.</v>

1250
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1251
00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.320
<v Speaker 3>so we're working with veterans and then we've also expanded it now to work with</v>

1252
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:20.710
<v Speaker 3>firefighters and also with police officers.</v>

1253
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:25.870
<v Speaker 3>And I had pretty much given up hope about getting a police officer actually to</v>

1254
00:38:25.871 --> 00:38:26.710
<v Speaker 3>volunteer.</v>

1255
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 3>So we've had 15 people out of 24 the 15th is going through screening.</v>

1256
00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:36.511
<v Speaker 3>The first 11 we're 11 of them were vets and were firefighters and now we have</v>

1257
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 3>the first police officer that is going through screening.</v>

1258
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.050
<v Speaker 3>So the people that are repressing it in some ways they do need it the most and</v>

1259
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>how to help them relax about it,</v>

1260
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 3>at least to let others or to explore themselves.</v>

1261
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I've been trying to get my father and mother to smoke pot</v>

1262
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 3>since I was 20 years old and they've never once done it,</v>

1263
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 3>but they're totally supportive of what I do.</v>

1264
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 3>They think it's a tremendous,</v>

1265
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 3>but they will not.</v>

1266
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 3>There was one time when my mother had um,</v>

1267
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1268
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1269
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 3>some pain.</v>

1270
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.520
<v Speaker 3>She had fallen down in,</v>

1271
00:39:10.521 --> 00:39:11.051
<v Speaker 3>in her leg,</v>

1272
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 3>was really in pain and she said she would try marijuana for pain and I got home</v>

1273
00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 3>like a week later because she's in a different city and she said then she wasn't</v>

1274
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 3>in enough pain anymore.</v>

1275
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1276
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I was too slow for a mom.</v>

1277
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1278
00:39:25.921 --> 00:39:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of folks that are a prisoner to that propaganda that was just</v>

1280
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.380
<v Speaker 1>really shot home from the 30s on.</v>

1281
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:33.781
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1282
00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:34.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1283
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty incredible feat when you stop and think about the effectiveness of</v>

1284
00:39:39.531 --> 00:39:44.531
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and not just for people like as far as like a a drug and not just for</v>

1285
00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:46.970
<v Speaker 1>its psychoactive properties,</v>

1286
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but just the plant hemp itself.</v>

1287
00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Just all the amazing benefits it has for as far as nutrition,</v>

1288
00:39:52.521 --> 00:39:53.720
<v Speaker 1>construction methods,</v>

1289
00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:55.700
<v Speaker 1>making paper and clothes and all these different things.</v>

1290
00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.780
<v Speaker 1>The fact that somehow none of that kept that from the public and kept it under</v>

1291
00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 1>wraps and kept the from really from the average person's database.</v>

1292
00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

1293
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 1>if you ask him about marijuana being illegal,</v>

1294
00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:08.090
<v Speaker 1>what about hemp?</v>

1295
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:08.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1296
00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:09.650
<v Speaker 1>it's isn't the same thing.</v>

1297
00:40:09.651 --> 00:40:10.484
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>

1298
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.820
<v Speaker 1>People don't even know what the fuck can't,</v>

1299
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:12.743
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

1300
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.171
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1301
00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:18.060
<v Speaker 3>what they should know is that the largest hemp importing country in the world is</v>

1302
00:40:18.061 --> 00:40:23.061
<v Speaker 3>the United States and the largest hemp x sporting country in the world is China.</v>

1303
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.320
<v Speaker 3>So why is that?</v>

1304
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Why we've kept it narrow legal.</v>

1305
00:40:27.211 --> 00:40:28.130
<v Speaker 3>We're inputting it,</v>

1306
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.580
<v Speaker 3>but relating other people grow it.</v>

1307
00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:30.414
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

1308
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.100
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1309
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that's all the largest producer of,</v>

1310
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.780
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1311
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.170
<v Speaker 1>of pharmaceutical drugs is United States.</v>

1312
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:36.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

1313
00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what it boils down to.</v>

1314
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.710
<v Speaker 1>The pharmaceutical drugs without a doubt don't want marijuana to become legal.</v>

1315
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 1>And one of the doorways from marijuana to become legal is him.</v>

1316
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.161
<v Speaker 1>His people.</v>

1317
00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:51.161
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out how incredibly effective hemp is for so many things that we use</v>

1318
00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:54.470
<v Speaker 1>other stuff for besides the psychoactive properties.</v>

1319
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Just it's a makes it fantastic protein powder.</v>

1320
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.590
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1321
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.680
<v Speaker 1>the company that I'm involved with on it,</v>

1322
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.510
<v Speaker 1>my friend Aubrey and I,</v>

1323
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.050
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1324
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.900
<v Speaker 1>when we was first you met Aubrey up in San Francisco,</v>

1325
00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 1>when we first started talking about a Hamp,</v>

1326
00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:08.840
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1327
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.261
<v Speaker 1>we thought,</v>

1328
00:41:09.261 --> 00:41:12.650
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we could get a farm in this country and you know,</v>

1329
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:17.000
<v Speaker 1>grow this hemp hemp seed and then use it for the protein powder completely.</v>

1330
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Non-Psychoactive when we found out you can't even do that.</v>

1331
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Like even though hemp is legal,</v>

1332
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1333
00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:25.070
<v Speaker 1>They literally can't be grown in the United States.</v>

1334
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.780
<v Speaker 1>We buy it all from Canada.</v>

1335
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.393
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

1337
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.283
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1338
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.970
<v Speaker 3>people on maps as board of directors is David Bronner.</v>

1339
00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And so from Bronner soaps,</v>

1340
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 3>his grandfather started and he's been very active in that hemp hemp oil soap.</v>

1341
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.540
<v Speaker 3>They use hemp oil and writing like a crazy person documentary on Netflix about</v>

1342
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:43.930
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1343
00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1344
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1345
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:45.643
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>

1346
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called Doctor Bronner's.</v>

1347
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Magic soap.</v>

1348
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend,</v>

1349
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 3>so I'll use 80 bravo.</v>

1350
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:50.850
<v Speaker 3>That's all he uses forever.</v>

1351
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1352
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 3>David and his brother Mike have built this business from,</v>

1353
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.630
<v Speaker 3>their father was kind of obsessed.</v>

1354
00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 3>They are their grandfather and they knew that.</v>

1355
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 3>So they took this business over when it was really fragmented and like a million</v>

1356
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 3>or two a year in sales and they've built it up to over 50 million,</v>

1357
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 3>50 million.</v>

1358
00:42:06.981 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 3>And they in sales not just hope at other products and they don't advertise,</v>

1359
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't advertise.</v>

1360
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:15.370
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they do now Bronner's soap,</v>

1361
00:42:15.371 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 3>kill it,</v>

1362
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 3>go get it.</v>

1363
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1364
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 3>here's your local.</v>

1365
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 3>What they do is a social justice illegally activism.</v>

1366
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:21.853
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>

1367
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1368
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 3>they focus on fair trade and other things.</v>

1369
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:29.771
<v Speaker 3>But what David did about four months ago or five months ago is he constructed a</v>

1370
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 3>cage,</v>

1371
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>a metal cage,</v>

1372
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:37.150
<v Speaker 3>and he had someone drop it off with him inside it in front of the White House</v>

1373
00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 3>right across the street.</v>

1374
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 3>And he was processing hemp plants.</v>

1375
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:44.600
<v Speaker 3>He had gotten real hemp seeds.</v>

1376
00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 3>He had grown it in the United States and he was processing it into hemp oil.</v>

1377
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>And he did this as a protest.</v>

1378
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>And the cage was to prevent the police to slow them down while they tried to</v>

1379
00:42:56.151 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 3>stop them from doing it.</v>

1380
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 3>And he actually got convicted and it had to do public service.</v>

1381
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 3>But what he was trying to show is that hemp,</v>

1382
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 3>which can be a food,</v>

1383
00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 3>which can be any number of different things and can be grown in the United</v>

1384
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:09.170
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

1385
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 3>was a crime.</v>

1386
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1387
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.870
<v Speaker 3>and just making it into hemp oil to put on his bread was enough to put him in</v>

1388
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 3>jail and to give them,</v>

1389
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:16.664
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1390
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1391
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.073
<v Speaker 3>penalties.</v>

1392
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense and it's insane that it continues to go on.</v>

1393
00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:26.831
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird aspects of our society where you look at it and you go,</v>

1394
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:27.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1395
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a reason.</v>

1396
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:29.001
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

1397
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 3>so let's search for a reason.</v>

1398
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 3>And you look for a reason and it literally doesn't exist.</v>

1399
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:37.820
<v Speaker 3>I think there are real strong reasons that go really deep that make us easy to</v>

1400
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 3>miss them.</v>

1401
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 3>But I think they're the natural fear that each of us has for when our social</v>

1402
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 3>controls are relaxed,</v>

1403
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 3>that will become a whatever we will become.</v>

1404
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:49.370
<v Speaker 3>It's what you talked about even in the tent,</v>

1405
00:43:49.371 --> 00:43:51.560
<v Speaker 3>when the t the flotation tank,</v>

1406
00:43:51.561 --> 00:43:52.550
<v Speaker 3>when things come up,</v>

1407
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just people are scared of the compromises that they've had to make to live</v>

1409
00:43:57.021 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 3>in society and have their basic urges and what happens when they're not in</v>

1410
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:02.084
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1411
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's what these drugs represent.</v>

1412
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:08.771
<v Speaker 3>And the 60s also represented not only these people that let themselves get out</v>

1413
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:09.321
<v Speaker 3>of control,</v>

1414
00:44:09.321 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 3>then they want to leave and drop out and then they want to change things.</v>

1415
00:44:12.681 --> 00:44:12.871
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

1416
00:44:12.871 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 3>it was a difficult,</v>

1417
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 3>people are scared of their own.</v>

1418
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.460
<v Speaker 3>I feel it in myself that I'm scared sometimes of,</v>

1419
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.913
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1420
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 3>my deep desires or you know,</v>

1422
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:25.623
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1423
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 3>that you just created a meme,</v>

1424
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:28.634
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

1425
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1426
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.803
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1427
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm scared of my deep desire.</v>

1428
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 7>I didn't need to see here's some 1970s music playing over that.</v>

1429
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:37.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1430
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:38.750
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's a big part.</v>

1431
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:39.351
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of that,</v>

1432
00:44:39.351 --> 00:44:40.760
<v Speaker 4>Jim Kelly died today,</v>

1433
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:41.210
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1434
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.500
<v Speaker 4>The great karate master,</v>

1435
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Jan,</v>

1436
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.270
<v Speaker 4>Jamie clued me on that.</v>

1437
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.960
<v Speaker 4>A dude from enter the dragon breast of pieced.</v>

1438
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.883
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Kelly.</v>

1439
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

1440
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1441
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:50.600
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1442
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.250
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1443
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.780
<v Speaker 4>That's important to think about how short our time is.</v>

1444
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.411
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1445
00:44:54.411 --> 00:44:54.920
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1446
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.753
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

1447
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.110
<v Speaker 4>That's why we got to get all these anti,</v>

1448
00:44:57.111 --> 00:45:02.111
<v Speaker 4>we'd people high or at least help them see more human rights,</v>

1449
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:03.201
<v Speaker 4>more freedom.</v>

1450
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Why should they tell us what to do?</v>

1451
00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:09.290
<v Speaker 4>And I think the other part of it is that the drug laws have been used for social</v>

1452
00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:14.291
<v Speaker 4>repression against minorities and either Mexicans or blacks or you know,</v>

1453
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:19.970
<v Speaker 4>hippies and that letting loose of that avenue of control.</v>

1454
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.290
<v Speaker 4>There's in the power system.</v>

1455
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:24.230
<v Speaker 4>And I think what we're needing to do to integrate these things,</v>

1456
00:45:24.231 --> 00:45:25.490
<v Speaker 4>to legalize marijuana,</v>

1457
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.840
<v Speaker 4>to legalize gay marriage,</v>

1458
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 4>these kinds of things where people see it's not going to tear apart the fabrics</v>

1459
00:45:29.771 --> 00:45:30.604
<v Speaker 4>of society,</v>

1460
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.640
<v Speaker 4>that people can make contributions and that people can also learn to deal with</v>

1461
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.940
<v Speaker 4>their deep desire so that they're not so scared of him.</v>

1462
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.411
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1463
00:45:38.411 --> 00:45:41.950
<v Speaker 7>We've made some massive headway as a culture because of that.</v>

1464
00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.610
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1465
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:42.851
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1466
00:45:42.851 --> 00:45:43.990
<v Speaker 7>the gay marriage thing,</v>

1467
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:47.740
<v Speaker 7>the fact that I'm Idaho got it before California,</v>

1468
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.850
<v Speaker 7>that that hurt,</v>

1469
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:50.463
<v Speaker 7>that really hurt.</v>

1470
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.161
<v Speaker 7>There was like,</v>

1471
00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:52.460
<v Speaker 7>how's how dumb you fucks.</v>

1472
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:53.731
<v Speaker 7>And the,</v>

1473
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:53.991
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1474
00:45:53.991 --> 00:45:54.280
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1475
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 7>the name of the bill that eliminated the ability for gay people to get married,</v>

1476
00:45:59.531 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 7>the marriage,</v>

1477
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.130
<v Speaker 7>but it was it fencing,</v>

1478
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.560
<v Speaker 7>defensive marriage act.</v>

1479
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.670
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>

1480
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.600
<v Speaker 7>How about if you really want to defend marriage?</v>

1481
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:08.201
<v Speaker 7>I'll be stopped.</v>

1482
00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:09.370
<v Speaker 7>People from getting divorced.</v>

1483
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.790
<v Speaker 7>See how that works out.</v>

1484
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.580
<v Speaker 7>You really want to defend marriage.</v>

1485
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.060
<v Speaker 7>Tell people they have to say together.</v>

1486
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 7>That should be a t shirt right there for real.</v>

1487
00:46:16.391 --> 00:46:17.620
<v Speaker 7>You want to defend marriage.</v>

1488
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.120
<v Speaker 7>Marriage is ridiculous.</v>

1489
00:46:19.121 --> 00:46:20.740
<v Speaker 7>This is coming from a person who's married.</v>

1490
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.660
<v Speaker 7>It's a stupid idea.</v>

1491
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:27.160
<v Speaker 7>It's a legal contract that you signed with another human being and then you're</v>

1492
00:46:27.161 --> 00:46:30.730
<v Speaker 7>going to bring in a bunch of other people if it doesn't work out and they get to</v>

1493
00:46:30.731 --> 00:46:33.550
<v Speaker 7>dictate where your money and property goes,</v>

1494
00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.413
<v Speaker 7>so why don't you do it?</v>

1495
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.313
<v Speaker 7>Because I love her.</v>

1496
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 7>She's an awesome person and it makes her feel better and I don't give a shit.</v>

1497
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.870
<v Speaker 7>We have children together and I'm not going anywhere.</v>

1498
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.510
<v Speaker 7>So I actually love being married to her.</v>

1499
00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:45.030
<v Speaker 7>I love her as a human being.</v>

1500
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.330
<v Speaker 7>She's a great person,</v>

1501
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.620
<v Speaker 7>but the whole involving the legal system part of it,</v>

1502
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:51.790
<v Speaker 7>it's so dumb.</v>

1503
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.280
<v Speaker 7>It's just so ridiculously dumb.</v>

1504
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.050
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

1505
00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:56.950
<v Speaker 7>And I,</v>

1506
00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 7>I understand completely the need for child support and for some folks needed to</v>

1507
00:47:02.921 --> 00:47:07.060
<v Speaker 7>be written in stone what they have to pay and things along those lines.</v>

1508
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:07.961
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

1509
00:47:07.961 --> 00:47:09.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm not that person and I,</v>

1510
00:47:09.461 --> 00:47:09.970
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

1511
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.090
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that I need to be regulated,</v>

1512
00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:13.781
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1513
00:47:13.781 --> 00:47:15.370
<v Speaker 7>if I've done nothing wrong,</v>

1514
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.520
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I need to be signed up to some system to prove that a relationship</v>

1515
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:22.360
<v Speaker 7>that I'm in is valuable to me.</v>

1516
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:22.961
<v Speaker 7>It just,</v>

1517
00:47:22.961 --> 00:47:24.190
<v Speaker 7>it seems stupid.</v>

1518
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.750
<v Speaker 7>It's almost seems like it's,</v>

1519
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:26.560
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

1520
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.760
<v Speaker 7>if you trust someone,</v>

1521
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:28.061
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

1522
00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 7>I do trust you.</v>

1523
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to need that shit on paper.</v>

1524
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1525
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.411
<v Speaker 7>I wonder,</v>

1526
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 7>since we're assertive male and more positions of power,</v>

1527
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 7>maybe marriage often is to more protect the woman.</v>

1528
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:39.611
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1529
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:40.091
<v Speaker 7>maybe.</v>

1530
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:40.451
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1531
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1532
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 7>I certainly think that there's something to that,</v>

1533
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1534
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 7>a woman wants to feel more secure.</v>

1535
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 7>I've heard women say that.</v>

1536
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 7>I've heard women,</v>

1537
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:49.690
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1538
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.171
<v Speaker 7>complete,</v>

1539
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:52.300
<v Speaker 7>like being completely outside of them,</v>

1540
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 7>eavesdropping in on a conversation and a women were talking about,</v>

1541
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1542
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.400
<v Speaker 7>I felt like much more secure in the marriage once or in the relationship once we</v>

1543
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:00.950
<v Speaker 7>were married.</v>

1544
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense,</v>

1545
00:48:01.931 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 7>but we were together for 10 years,</v>

1546
00:48:03.341 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 7>but once we got married that I felt like it was real and then I could relax.</v>

1547
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 7>I had that part of my,</v>

1548
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:08.140
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1549
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 7>but that's their own social hangup,</v>

1550
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1551
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 7>I think it's just some,</v>

1552
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 7>did Sandra Bullock movie shit any different after you got married?</v>

1553
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.790
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely not.</v>

1554
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 7>I felt like a,</v>

1555
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 7>I did something that,</v>

1556
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:18.610
<v Speaker 7>I always thought it was ridiculous.</v>

1557
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.020
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1558
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.321
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1559
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 7>it's like you,</v>

1560
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.030
<v Speaker 7>the idea behind it of,</v>

1561
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 7>of committing to a person and then giving your all to a person,</v>

1562
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.990
<v Speaker 7>that's all beautiful.</v>

1563
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.460
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

1564
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:29.591
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1565
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:34.591
<v Speaker 7>the real problem with anything where it's two people is who knows what those two</v>

1566
00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:38.290
<v Speaker 7>people are going to be like five years from now,</v>

1567
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 7>who knows what they're gonna be like 10 years from now.</v>

1568
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.030
<v Speaker 7>And I've seen it and it's ugly.</v>

1569
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:48.031
<v Speaker 7>I've seen people that got along great and then the one person took a left,</v>

1570
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 7>the other person took a right and they're stuck in the same house together and</v>

1571
00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 7>they don't like each other anymore.</v>

1572
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 7>And it gets really gross.</v>

1573
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 7>And then when they have to separate,</v>

1574
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 7>I've seen what happens when they use the legal system against each other.</v>

1575
00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.411
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1576
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 7>I wrote a whole bit about it because I saw my friend who had to pay for his</v>

1577
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 7>wife's lawyer.</v>

1578
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 7>He was,</v>

1579
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 7>they were going to war and he had to pay for the enemy's general.</v>

1580
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1581
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 7>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

1582
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 7>I think the idea that if you,</v>

1583
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.741
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1584
00:49:14.741 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1585
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 7>if you're taking care of the woman,</v>

1586
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 7>you should pay some form of alimony.</v>

1587
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.461
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1588
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 7>definitely the child support.</v>

1589
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:20.171
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

1590
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:21.004
<v Speaker 7>definitely.</v>

1591
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1592
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 7>you split property that you got when you were together.</v>

1593
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 7>I'm for that,</v>

1594
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:26.343
<v Speaker 7>I'm for all that,</v>

1595
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.183
<v Speaker 7>I'm for all that,</v>

1596
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:32.310
<v Speaker 7>what I'm not for is this gross system where the lawyers play off of each other</v>

1597
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:37.240
<v Speaker 7>and try to stretch things out because that's how they make the most money where</v>

1598
00:49:37.241 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 7>they asked for outrageous amounts so that you come back with like a little bit</v>

1599
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 7>less and it becomes this mad hustle.</v>

1600
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 7>And like I said,</v>

1601
00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 7>I am in no way saying that I'm not,</v>

1602
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 7>I'm not pro relationship,</v>

1603
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.910
<v Speaker 7>but I've watched someone's life fall apart because of a bad divorce.</v>

1604
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.440
<v Speaker 7>Whereas if they just broke up,</v>

1605
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 7>it would be cool.</v>

1606
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 7>But she dragged him through the mud legally for like a year and a half,</v>

1607
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:02.561
<v Speaker 7>two years,</v>

1608
00:50:02.561 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 7>emptied his bank account and it was horrific,</v>

1609
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 7>like targeted him.</v>

1610
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.170
<v Speaker 7>And that can happen you,</v>

1611
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.970
<v Speaker 7>when you're legally attached to someone,</v>

1612
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 7>it just,</v>

1613
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 7>whereas you could be like,</v>

1614
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:12.701
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1615
00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:13.361
<v Speaker 7>we're broken up.</v>

1616
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1617
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1618
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to be with you anymore.</v>

1619
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to be with me anymore.</v>

1620
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:18.610
<v Speaker 7>So we'll just go our separate ways.</v>

1621
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

1622
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.310
<v Speaker 7>Well or if you had the lord,</v>

1623
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 7>that's what was even squirrelier.</v>

1624
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.300
<v Speaker 7>There's not even any kids involved.</v>

1625
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:27.710
<v Speaker 7>So why do you have to pay for this person</v>

1626
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 3>when you described that somebody takes left,</v>

1627
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 3>the other person takes the right.</v>

1628
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1629
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I think that when we started tying to think about Mtma for couples therapy,</v>

1630
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 3>cause that's one of the main people reason people use it is for relationships.</v>

1631
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And there's um,</v>

1632
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 3>but not all relationships should stay together.</v>

1633
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 3>So trying to do a study,</v>

1634
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.670
<v Speaker 3>a scientific study of,</v>

1635
00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 3>of MDA with couples.</v>

1636
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.990
<v Speaker 3>If you decide that your success is how many of them stay married,</v>

1637
00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 3>that's not necessarily the smartest thing to do.</v>

1638
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 3>So what we felt was that it would be,</v>

1639
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 3>if they make a mutual decision and whatever that decision happens to be,</v>

1640
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:05.893
<v Speaker 3>if it can be,</v>

1641
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 3>they stayed together,</v>

1642
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:07.431
<v Speaker 3>they split up.</v>

1643
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 3>If there's some kind of mutuality about it.</v>

1644
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.190
<v Speaker 3>If the MTMA helps them to listen to each other and to communicate and they can</v>

1645
00:51:13.191 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 3>make a mutual decision,</v>

1646
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:15.680
<v Speaker 3>that would be considered a success.</v>

1647
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:20.681
<v Speaker 3>But we haven't gone forward with that research because politically having a</v>

1648
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:26.261
<v Speaker 3>difficult relationship is not a disease and we need to work in a disease context</v>

1649
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 3>so that we can get prescription approval to have legal access in a medical</v>

1650
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:31.860
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

1651
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1652
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a real issue.</v>

1653
00:51:33.391 --> 00:51:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You know that was the issue with Modafinil.</v>

1654
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what that is?</v>

1655
00:51:36.661 --> 00:51:37.494
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1656
00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 1>that's one of my whole vigil use agile.</v>

1657
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm using that right now.</v>

1658
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.673
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

1659
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:44.731
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

1660
00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I might as well.</v>

1661
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.950
<v Speaker 1>That's that shit that I've given you.</v>

1662
00:51:46.951 --> 00:51:48.630
<v Speaker 1>This stuff keeps you awake.</v>

1663
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1664
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1665
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.593
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferris,</v>

1666
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.310
<v Speaker 1>who I respect very highly,</v>

1667
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I had a very interesting point about it.</v>

1668
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.051
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1669
00:51:55.051 --> 00:51:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe there's any biological free lunch and that's why he doesn't,</v>

1670
00:51:58.321 --> 00:52:00.090
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even put it in the four hour,</v>

1671
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever for our body because he was worried that people would just start</v>

1672
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:04.110
<v Speaker 1>chewing them like candy.</v>

1673
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1674
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I happened to know somebody that uses it for narcolepsy.</v>

1675
00:52:07.681 --> 00:52:09.750
<v Speaker 3>He uses a twice a day for about,</v>

1676
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1677
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:10.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1678
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm here to say.</v>

1679
00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 1>The reason why it's prescribed for narcolepsy has,</v>

1680
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:19.460
<v Speaker 1>because they initially created it for performance enhancing purposes and then</v>

1681
00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the government's like,</v>

1682
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:20.451
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1683
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't just like say I want my brain to work better.</v>

1684
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a disease so they go narcolepsy and that's how it got</v>

1685
00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Speaker 1>approved.</v>

1686
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1687
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1688
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.410
<v Speaker 1>But it was probably,</v>

1689
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 1>it works for narcolepsy.</v>

1690
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.581
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1691
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And I got to use it.</v>

1692
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 1>People falling asleep all the time.</v>

1693
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 1>They're conking out with this stuff.</v>

1694
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Does it keep you awake?</v>

1695
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1696
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:38.740
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't,</v>

1697
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.330
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty transparent.</v>

1698
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.160
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't add a lot of other things.</v>

1699
00:52:42.161 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's very weird.</v>

1700
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:46.090
<v Speaker 3>The military is actually shifting towards,</v>

1701
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.631
<v Speaker 3>towards it,</v>

1702
00:52:46.631 --> 00:52:49.270
<v Speaker 3>away from speed and amphetamines.</v>

1703
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1704
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>

1705
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1706
00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Speed fucks you up and makes you do shitty things and the next you make terrible</v>

1707
00:52:55.711 --> 00:52:56.370
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

1708
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Poor decision making capabilities.</v>

1709
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's worse than alcohol and a lot of ways.</v>

1710
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1711
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's a Modafinil is also for jet lag,</v>

1712
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:05.130
<v Speaker 1>for shift work.</v>

1713
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1714
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1715
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
00:53:06.691 --> 00:53:10.020
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I took it tonight is because I was caught in the gay pride</v>

1717
00:53:10.021 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>parade for Francisco couldn't get out of town.</v>

1718
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:13.841
<v Speaker 1>They got you.</v>

1719
00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And so I just wanted to,</v>

1720
00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:16.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1721
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.260
<v Speaker 1>how easy is it to get prescribed something like that?</v>

1722
00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Because as an example,</v>

1723
00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1724
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I had just got off cigarettes.</v>

1725
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I wake up,</v>

1726
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:23.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1727
00:53:23.881 --> 00:53:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I could barely get out of bed.</v>

1728
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Whole Day is</v>

1729
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>just like I can,</v>

1730
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I just lay back down.</v>

1731
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I take one fourth of a,</v>

1732
00:53:30.201 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 2>an Adderall and 20 minutes later I'm just like,</v>

1733
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 2>how much work can I do?</v>

1734
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:33.841
<v Speaker 2>And I can,</v>

1735
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:34.160
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

1736
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:34.870
<v Speaker 2>my brain's like,</v>

1737
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 2>that's a lie.</v>

1738
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.473
<v Speaker 2>And it's working.</v>

1739
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1740
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's a completely different sort of experience.</v>

1741
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.250
<v Speaker 2>But for something like,</v>

1742
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:41.460
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1743
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1744
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's also given to people that have like weird shifts,</v>

1745
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:45.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1746
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:45.781
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>

1747
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 2>entertainers and stuff.</v>

1748
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:47.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1749
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times I'm talking too much.</v>

1750
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I can get your prescription.</v>

1751
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1752
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.163
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1753
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:52.960
<v Speaker 2>You go to a doctor tell you,</v>

1754
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:53.561
<v Speaker 2>don't worry.</v>

1755
00:53:53.561 --> 00:53:54.101
<v Speaker 2>I got a doctor.</v>

1756
00:53:54.101 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1757
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.253
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1758
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:55.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1759
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.060
<v Speaker 2>my main person I guess.</v>

1760
00:53:58.061 --> 00:53:58.341
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

1761
00:53:58.341 --> 00:53:59.860
<v Speaker 2>is it something that's hard to know?</v>

1762
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I know people who've done it.</v>

1763
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1764
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:01.691
<v Speaker 2>A doctor.</v>

1765
00:54:01.691 --> 00:54:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling so good.</v>

1766
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm sleepy.</v>

1767
00:54:03.041 --> 00:54:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1768
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 7>this is something called new vigil.</v>

1769
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 7>I think maybe that'll help me.</v>

1770
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:06.271
<v Speaker 7>Boom,</v>

1771
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:06.571
<v Speaker 7>Bang,</v>

1772
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:06.850
<v Speaker 7>boom.</v>

1773
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:07.030
<v Speaker 7>Shut.</v>

1774
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.291
<v Speaker 7>Bam.</v>

1775
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 7>You're out the door with description.</v>

1776
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.690
<v Speaker 7>We're trying to give out prescriptions,</v>

1777
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1778
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.440
<v Speaker 7>Doctors are trying to give you prescriptions.</v>

1779
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 7>Do you know that?</v>

1780
00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 7>You want to hear something fucking crazy.</v>

1781
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 7>There was something in Montana the,</v>

1782
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 7>they recently released where Montana has x amount of people living in it.</v>

1783
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.710
<v Speaker 7>One fourth of them around oxycontin's</v>

1784
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.841
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1785
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 7>fucking crazy.</v>

1786
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 7>That is,</v>

1787
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 7>I need to verify that because someone told me that today.</v>

1788
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1789
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.090
<v Speaker 7>oxycontin's</v>

1790
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I guess I just never tried to go get prescription medicine ever.</v>

1791
00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:40.923
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

1792
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a time when,</v>

1793
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1794
00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:46.773
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

1795
00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.613
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1796
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.930
<v Speaker 3>possibly helpful that it can be okay to do it.</v>

1797
00:54:49.931 --> 00:54:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I think I prefer trying to do things on my own without it.</v>

1798
00:54:53.021 --> 00:54:54.310
<v Speaker 3>And then only if it's,</v>

1799
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1800
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.200
<v Speaker 3>beyond my capabilities or something that I think enhances it.</v>

1801
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.130
<v Speaker 3>So I think the,</v>

1802
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:01.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1803
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.580
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a jet lag shift,</v>

1804
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.610
<v Speaker 3>you doctors do want you to have a,</v>

1805
00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.693
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1806
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.180
<v Speaker 3>relationship to what it was approved for.</v>

1807
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.680
<v Speaker 3>But around 40% of the prescriptions in America are called off label.</v>

1808
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:18.310
<v Speaker 3>We're doctors prescribe it for things that it's not been approved for.</v>

1809
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1810
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And that cannot be stopped.</v>

1811
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not bad.</v>

1812
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.550
<v Speaker 3>What's some of the things that this drug is used off label,</v>

1813
00:55:24.551 --> 00:55:25.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess?</v>

1814
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1815
00:55:25.571 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a</v>

1816
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.541
<v Speaker 7>off label.</v>

1817
00:55:28.541 --> 00:55:31.840
<v Speaker 7>People are just taking it for performance enhancing substance reasons.</v>

1818
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:32.711
<v Speaker 7>That's why they're doing it.</v>

1819
00:55:32.711 --> 00:55:35.230
<v Speaker 7>That's the big reason that I always here.</v>

1820
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.040
<v Speaker 7>And the big diseases narcotic.</v>

1821
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:38.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1822
00:55:38.631 --> 00:55:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And the concern is that,</v>

1823
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:40.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1824
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:40.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:42.620
<v Speaker 3>if people have performance enhancing drugs,</v>

1826
00:55:42.621 --> 00:55:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but they're willing to hurt themselves in order to do it because there's no free</v>

1827
00:55:47.121 --> 00:55:47.954
<v Speaker 3>lunch.</v>

1828
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 3>But with modafinil there,</v>

1829
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:54.490
<v Speaker 3>there are ranges of use of certain drugs where it doesn't seem like there are</v>

1830
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.320
<v Speaker 3>harmful constant.</v>

1831
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:56.580
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1832
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Speaker 7>it Montana,</v>

1833
00:55:58.681 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 7>a gazette,</v>

1834
00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 7>the billings gazette is the one that printed this.</v>

1835
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.820
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1836
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.230
<v Speaker 7>it is one out of four that's unfucking believable.</v>

1837
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 7>Montana has just under a million residents.</v>

1838
00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:13.020
<v Speaker 7>One out of four have an oxycontin prescription.</v>

1839
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.580
<v Speaker 7>It's incredible.</v>

1840
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.193
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1841
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.291
<v Speaker 3>Is that pain?</v>

1842
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how they,</v>

1843
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:19.810
<v Speaker 7>listen.</v>

1844
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:20.920
<v Speaker 7>I have,</v>

1845
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.280
<v Speaker 7>I've gone in for operations and they gave me a all kinds of shit that I didn't</v>

1846
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:26.861
<v Speaker 7>tank,</v>

1847
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:27.511
<v Speaker 7>but they'll,</v>

1848
00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 7>they'll give you whatever you need for pain.</v>

1849
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.580
<v Speaker 7>Even did you tell him it's nothing I went into to get a deviated septum and uh,</v>

1850
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.890
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

1851
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of uncomfortable thing,</v>

1852
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 7>stuff your nose and they crack it and break it and widen it.</v>

1853
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.060
<v Speaker 7>I had a really fucked up septum and it was kind of,</v>

1854
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:46.571
<v Speaker 7>I literally,</v>

1855
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 7>my nose was useless for most of my life until I had this operation.</v>

1856
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:53.140
<v Speaker 7>But my doctor gave me like two different kinds of pain killers and I,</v>

1857
00:56:53.141 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

1858
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 7>this doesn't even hurt though.</v>

1859
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.091
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

1860
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 7>well it's going to probably tonight,</v>

1861
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 7>tonight you're probably going to be in significant pain.</v>

1862
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.823
<v Speaker 7>Never came.</v>

1863
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>

1864
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.971
<v Speaker 7>it was weird.</v>

1865
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:01.721
<v Speaker 7>I had this stuffed,</v>

1866
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 7>stuffed up my nose,</v>

1867
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.000
<v Speaker 7>but there was no pain.</v>

1868
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 7>But meanwhile,</v>

1869
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 7>if you're a person is easily addictive and you take one of those and you go,</v>

1870
00:57:09.881 --> 00:57:10.371
<v Speaker 7>God damn it,</v>

1871
00:57:10.371 --> 00:57:10.991
<v Speaker 7>I can't sleep.</v>

1872
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Speaker 7>And then you take two more of those.</v>

1873
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.301
<v Speaker 7>And the next thing I know,</v>

1874
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 7>you're going to another doctor and telling me you're in pain.</v>

1875
00:57:15.521 --> 00:57:18.220
<v Speaker 7>You get a second prescription and you're off to the races.</v>

1876
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:18.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1877
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.480
<v Speaker 3>We had one of the veterans and our,</v>

1878
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1879
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.300
<v Speaker 3>PTSD study,</v>

1880
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1881
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.731
<v Speaker 3>took one dose,</v>

1882
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:29.530
<v Speaker 3>dropped out of the study and under the influence of this medium dose of Mtma,</v>

1883
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1884
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 3>he started feeling that he was taking pain meds,</v>

1885
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 3>not just for the pain,</v>

1886
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:37.540
<v Speaker 3>but he was kind of getting addicted,</v>

1887
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 3>depended on them and he didn't want to do that anymore.</v>

1888
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.630
<v Speaker 3>We're war wounds,</v>

1889
00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.191
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1890
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 3>And so he decided that he didn't need the pain meds anymore and he also felt</v>

1891
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:52.111
<v Speaker 3>like he had come to terms with the issues that had caused him to be suffering</v>

1892
00:57:52.661 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 3>from post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

1893
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 3>that he accepted these things and that he could go forward without a PTSD.</v>

1894
00:57:58.631 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 3>And so he dropped out of the study,</v>

1895
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:00.671
<v Speaker 3>but we said,</v>

1896
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 3>we want to ask you at two months,</v>

1897
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 3>in 12 months,</v>

1898
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 3>our followups,</v>

1899
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.983
<v Speaker 3>how you're doing.</v>

1900
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 3>And his PTSD was still gone after a year.</v>

1901
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.550
<v Speaker 7>That's amazing.</v>

1902
00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:09.840
<v Speaker 7>The PTSD,</v>

1903
00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:10.200
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1904
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:10.940
<v Speaker 7>use,</v>

1905
00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:11.310
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1906
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:13.920
<v Speaker 7>the use of Mtma for PTSD is a,</v>

1907
00:58:13.921 --> 00:58:17.430
<v Speaker 7>one of the ones that was discussed recently by this,</v>

1908
00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:21.900
<v Speaker 7>a soldier who wrote this very eloquent letter and then committed suicide when he</v>

1909
00:58:21.901 --> 00:58:26.290
<v Speaker 7>was talking about the Dea [inaudible] letter on the airplane here.</v>

1910
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:26.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1911
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:27.511
<v Speaker 7>I assumed that it was,</v>

1912
00:58:27.511 --> 00:58:28.440
<v Speaker 7>when he was talking about,</v>

1913
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:29.300
<v Speaker 7>it's a big,</v>

1914
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.290
<v Speaker 7>big issue with,</v>

1915
00:58:30.291 --> 00:58:30.510
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1916
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:31.200
<v Speaker 7>with veterans.</v>

1917
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.300
<v Speaker 7>I assumed he was talking about marijuana,</v>

1918
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:34.650
<v Speaker 7>what can I do as well?</v>

1919
00:58:34.651 --> 00:58:37.170
<v Speaker 7>But I thought it was Mtma probably both,</v>

1920
00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.860
<v Speaker 7>but the MDM main one has been discussed a lot by friends that I have that have</v>

1921
00:58:40.861 --> 00:58:41.700
<v Speaker 7>been in the military.</v>

1922
00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.880
<v Speaker 7>They know it helps and they want to know about it.</v>

1923
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:45.250
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1924
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:50.250
<v Speaker 7>I heard it's the one where you hear a lot of people going through very traumatic</v>

1925
00:58:50.611 --> 00:58:52.590
<v Speaker 7>things and then they get over it.</v>

1926
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:53.310
<v Speaker 7>They're okay,</v>

1927
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.590
<v Speaker 7>they understand it and accept it and that's it.</v>

1928
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1929
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.091
<v Speaker 3>they've heard about it.</v>

1930
00:58:57.091 --> 00:58:57.511
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1931
00:58:57.511 --> 00:59:01.710
<v Speaker 3>we had a meeting in the Pentagon where we are trying to get formal cooperation</v>

1932
00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:06.570
<v Speaker 3>and they expressed that their biggest fear was that if they were to cooperate on</v>

1933
00:59:06.571 --> 00:59:07.590
<v Speaker 3>an MDA study,</v>

1934
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.340
<v Speaker 3>that the word would get out Moreso than before.</v>

1935
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And that a lot of people who were in the military,</v>

1936
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:17.130
<v Speaker 3>who only a small number of them will get into clinical studies,</v>

1937
00:59:17.131 --> 00:59:22.131
<v Speaker 3>that they would go out on their own and get stuff that was impure or not in s or</v>

1938
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 3>pure but not in a safe place and that there that would cause more harm.</v>

1939
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 3>And they said that shouldn't stop the research,</v>

1940
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but that that was the concern and what we're thinking of saying it,</v>

1941
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.550
<v Speaker 3>what would we did say is that the word is getting out and we've had articles in</v>

1942
00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Stars and Stripes and the Marine Corps times and military.com about the results</v>

1943
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:43.200
<v Speaker 3>of our study.</v>

1944
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.640
<v Speaker 7>I think they owed to the soldiers.</v>

1945
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.050
<v Speaker 7>And I think that if they wanted to start a Kickstarter to have MTMA clinics pop</v>

1946
00:59:49.051 --> 00:59:50.280
<v Speaker 7>up with a legitimate stuff,</v>

1947
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.010
<v Speaker 7>government approved and tested all throughout the country,</v>

1948
00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:53.340
<v Speaker 7>it would,</v>

1949
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 7>it could be user funded.</v>

1950
00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:56.560
<v Speaker 3>We are going to do that with the Indiegogo.</v>

1951
00:59:56.561 --> 01:00:01.561
<v Speaker 3>Kickstarter doesn't take medical shows but Indeigogo does and we are going to</v>

1952
01:00:01.781 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 3>try to do it to crowdsource a support for the study with veterans,</v>

1953
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.210
<v Speaker 3>firefighters and police officers.</v>

1954
01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:07.840
<v Speaker 3>Great idea.</v>

1955
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.260
<v Speaker 3>The thing about the psychedelics so that people understand what we're really</v>

1956
01:00:11.261 --> 01:00:14.530
<v Speaker 3>talking about with the psychedelic Madison is it's only used a few times.</v>

1957
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:18.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the drugs that we were talking about that people get prescribed</v>

1958
01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:20.680
<v Speaker 3>every day or several times a day.</v>

1959
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It's only part of a psychotherapeutic process with more non drug psychotherapy</v>

1960
01:00:26.141 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 3>sessions and what they can integrate from it.</v>

1961
01:00:29.381 --> 01:00:32.830
<v Speaker 3>So our three and a half month program for Ptsd,</v>

1962
01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:33.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1963
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:36.040
<v Speaker 3>treatment includes only three days of Mtma.</v>

1964
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:41.370
<v Speaker 7>I think people need to understand that all these things are tools that have been</v>

1965
01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:42.204
<v Speaker 7>denied us.</v>

1966
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

1967
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.010
<v Speaker 7>that deal,</v>

1968
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.070
<v Speaker 7>I used to joke about it that like marijuana is like a hammer.</v>

1969
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:47.761
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1970
01:00:47.761 --> 01:00:48.330
<v Speaker 7>you could,</v>

1971
01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:51.030
<v Speaker 7>you could hammer nails with it or you could just hit yourself with a dick if</v>

1972
01:00:51.031 --> 01:00:51.960
<v Speaker 7>you're fucking crazy,</v>

1973
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:52.321
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1974
01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:54.840
<v Speaker 7>Like just cause you have a tool doesn't mean you're going to use it properly.</v>

1975
01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.910
<v Speaker 7>And when you smoke too much pot and freak out and when you,</v>

1976
01:00:57.911 --> 01:00:58.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1977
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.030
<v Speaker 7>take acid and jump off a roof.</v>

1978
01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 7>Yes you've done it improperly,</v>

1979
01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:07.050
<v Speaker 7>but you're dealing with this incredibly complex thing that is really not being</v>

1980
01:01:07.051 --> 01:01:08.760
<v Speaker 7>explained to the general public.</v>

1981
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.420
<v Speaker 7>The dabbling in psychedelics is all sort of done with anecdotal evidence passed</v>

1982
01:01:14.761 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 7>on by friends or books that you've read or all the,</v>

1983
01:01:17.871 --> 01:01:18.271
<v Speaker 7>all these,</v>

1984
01:01:18.271 --> 01:01:20.940
<v Speaker 7>you know and it's unnecessary at this point.</v>

1985
01:01:20.941 --> 01:01:22.140
<v Speaker 7>We have enough information.</v>

1986
01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:22.801
<v Speaker 7>There's enough data.</v>

1987
01:01:22.801 --> 01:01:24.990
<v Speaker 7>There's enough online@maps.org</v>

1988
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1989
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 3>add mass that are we,</v>

1990
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.750
<v Speaker 3>we are doing drug development in the open.</v>

1991
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 3>We publish our protocols,</v>

1992
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 3>we publish our data,</v>

1993
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.030
<v Speaker 3>we publish all of our timelines of ours,</v>

1994
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 3>relationships with regulatory.</v>

1995
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 3>We publish our review of the literature.</v>

1996
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:44.051
<v Speaker 3>We have a treatment manual that describes what the therapy component is that</v>

1997
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 3>they are with our adherence criteria.</v>

1998
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to make the all of it publicly available and at the same time</v>

1999
01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the pressure that's coming on the pharmaceutical companies actually to</v>

2000
01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>release more of their data.</v>

2001
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 3>But the important thing is that the DEA is not stopping MTMA research.</v>

2002
01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 3>The FDA is not stopping.</v>

2003
01:02:00.771 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 3>We are able to do psychedelic research in the United States and most countries</v>

2004
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:06.980
<v Speaker 3>of the world where we want to.</v>

2005
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 3>We have studies right now in Israel,</v>

2006
01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:09.051
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland,</v>

2007
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:09.884
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

2008
01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 3>and we've done,</v>

2009
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I began research in Mexico and New Zealand,</v>

2010
01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 3>I wasco research in Canada,</v>

2011
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:21.610
<v Speaker 3>so that the only thing that's really politically blocked right now is marijuana</v>

2012
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:22.614
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>

2013
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

2014
01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 3>It's shocking,</v>

2015
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>

2016
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 3>You're getting all this research done and this is,</v>

2017
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 3>this is very new,</v>

2018
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 3>like two decades ago,</v>

2019
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 3>this was not possible.</v>

2020
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 3>It was impossible.</v>

2021
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.990
<v Speaker 3>And when did it start being possible?</v>

2022
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2023
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 3>actually what happened was,</v>

2024
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 3>and I did my dissertation at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government,</v>

2025
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I got my master's and phd there,</v>

2026
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 3>and the part of my dissertation was on how this happened.</v>

2027
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Who at the FDA change things and was it other places as well?</v>

2028
01:02:51.211 --> 01:02:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Was it a social consensus?</v>

2029
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.970
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that in the late 1980s there was a lot of,</v>

2030
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 3>particularly Reagan had been before pro business.</v>

2031
01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of concern that the FDA was too slow evaluating drugs,</v>

2032
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 3>that they were mostly trying to block risks and they didn't care that much about</v>

2033
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 3>treating illness.</v>

2034
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And so the FDA set up this group called the pilot drug evaluation staff,</v>

2035
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 3>which was that they would pilot drug evaluation methods to try to speed up the</v>

2036
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:20.580
<v Speaker 3>drug review process.</v>

2037
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And this group needed drugs to actually work with.</v>

2038
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 3>And so they looked around the other pro parts of the FDA and they kind of</v>

2039
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 3>cobbled together different kinds of drugs and they looked at the people that had</v>

2040
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>control over scheduled drugs and marijuana,</v>

2041
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 3>all the psychedelics,</v>

2042
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:39.420
<v Speaker 3>and they had been suppressing things for decades and they said,</v>

2043
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:39.631
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

2044
01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:40.464
<v Speaker 3>we'll give this up.</v>

2045
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 3>And so this new branch came,</v>

2046
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:43.614
<v Speaker 3>they didn't,</v>

2047
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but they also were more science over politics.</v>

2048
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:52.010
<v Speaker 3>So starting in 1990 the first study was approved with Dmt by Rick Strassman.</v>

2049
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Speaker 3>And we had tried for five studies before for years before with the Mtma all</v>

2050
01:03:58.441 --> 01:03:59.011
<v Speaker 3>rejected.</v>

2051
01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 3>But once this new team got into place,</v>

2052
01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2053
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:06.030
<v Speaker 3>then they had to review our study Mtma for cancer patients with anxiety.</v>

2054
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:11.210
<v Speaker 3>And there was a 1992 advisory committee meeting to determine whether the FDA</v>

2055
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 3>would go forward with psychedelic research and they did it bureaucratically in a</v>

2056
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:16.674
<v Speaker 3>brilliant way.</v>

2057
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.090
<v Speaker 3>They had the DEA there,</v>

2058
01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 3>they had the uh,</v>

2059
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 3>office of National Drug Control Policy.</v>

2060
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 3>They had the national institute on Drug Abuse.</v>

2061
01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:28.251
<v Speaker 3>They had representatives from all of these branches and they proposed an idea</v>

2062
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:32.670
<v Speaker 3>and their idea was that the regulations that they put on the major drugs for the</v>

2063
01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:37.671
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industries that the risks of the medical use of psychedelics and</v>

2064
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>

2065
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.600
<v Speaker 3>we're no different.</v>

2066
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 3>And so they would treat these drugs as if they were drugs being developed by the</v>

2067
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:45.150
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industry.</v>

2068
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 3>And the same procedures would be fine.</v>

2069
01:04:47.131 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 3>And the Dea,</v>

2070
01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Nita,</v>

2071
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.441
<v Speaker 3>the drugs,</v>

2072
01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:49.981
<v Speaker 3>ours office,</v>

2073
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:50.461
<v Speaker 3>they all thought,</v>

2074
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:52.140
<v Speaker 3>man you put it in there,</v>

2075
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

2076
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:56.940
<v Speaker 3>it'll never get out again because who can act like the pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2077
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:01.380
<v Speaker 3>And so they all signed off and FDA got this policy in 1992 and then they</v>

2078
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:03.180
<v Speaker 3>approved our first study with Mtma,</v>

2079
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.220
<v Speaker 3>which was a safety study.</v>

2080
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:10.650
<v Speaker 3>And then they started approving studies with psilocybin and then expanding our</v>

2081
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 3>MD may studies into patient populations.</v>

2082
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:17.990
<v Speaker 3>So there's a 20 year history now and a lot of track record and data and now we</v>

2083
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 3>have data on the benefits side,</v>

2084
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 3>not just on the risk side so that we can talk about balancing before people</v>

2085
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>could say there are no benefits,</v>

2086
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:27.670
<v Speaker 3>there's these risks,</v>

2087
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 3>therefore nothing's permitted.</v>

2088
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 3>So the dynamics have completely changed and we've demonstrated so far,</v>

2089
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 3>over 800 people have taken Mtma and clinical research all over the world.</v>

2090
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2091
01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:41.674
<v Speaker 3>nobody's gone.</v>

2092
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's had a serious adverse event that left them harmful.</v>

2093
01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has become addicts as far as we know to Mtma.</v>

2094
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Nobody went crazy.</v>

2095
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 3>So we've demonstrated there are safe places.</v>

2096
01:05:53.861 --> 01:05:58.861
<v Speaker 3>Our study with LSD and Switzerland for people who are dying was 12 people and 11</v>

2097
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:01.300
<v Speaker 3>of them had never done LSD before.</v>

2098
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

2099
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:07.680
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to show that it can be brought to people who are not from this</v>

2100
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:08.591
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2101
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 3>not used to this,</v>

2102
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but it can be helpful to them in a controlled setting with supportive therapists</v>

2103
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.750
<v Speaker 3>and with a lot of integration and preparation work.</v>

2104
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 7>And people were aware of a other studies like the Johns Hopkins study on</v>

2105
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:24.220
<v Speaker 7>Psilocybin now that's gotten a lot of steam because,</v>

2106
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2107
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:29.070
<v Speaker 7>these people many years later experienced great personality benefits that stuck</v>

2108
01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:29.730
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

2109
01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:30.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:30.660
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2111
01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2112
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:36.500
<v Speaker 3>the study of psilocybin and people who were spiritually inclined to see if they</v>

2113
01:06:36.631 --> 01:06:41.100
<v Speaker 3>could have a spiritual experience that actually there was the classic study that</v>

2114
01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:46.101
<v Speaker 3>that's modeled on was called the Good Friday experiment and it was done in 1962</v>

2115
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.710
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the best things that Timothy leary ever dead.</v>

2116
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.730
<v Speaker 3>And I ended up doing a 25 year followup to,</v>

2117
01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.880
<v Speaker 3>at tracking these people down.</v>

2118
01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:55.890
<v Speaker 3>But basically in 1962,</v>

2119
01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.280
<v Speaker 3>lots of people thought that psychedelics had some genuine spiritual potential.</v>

2120
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:06.950
<v Speaker 3>And Martin Luther King was getting a phd at Boston University and his mentor</v>

2121
01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:09.240
<v Speaker 3>there was Reverend Howard Thurman.</v>

2122
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:12.000
<v Speaker 3>This dynamic black minister who's just fantastic,</v>

2123
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>and he agreed to have Timothy leary and Ram Das and others,</v>

2124
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.030
<v Speaker 3>20 people and 10 guides come into their church on Good Friday and do an</v>

2125
01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:21.930
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>

2126
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.950
<v Speaker 3>And these were all students from Andover Newton theological seminary and half of</v>

2127
01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:26.220
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2128
01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.180
<v Speaker 3>they all got pills,</v>

2129
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 3>half were psilocybin,</v>

2130
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:30.120
<v Speaker 3>30 milligrams,</v>

2131
01:07:30.121 --> 01:07:31.110
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty strong.</v>

2132
01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:33.150
<v Speaker 3>And the other half was nicotinic acid,</v>

2133
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.180
<v Speaker 3>which gives you this hot flush and it acts quicker.</v>

2134
01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:38.100
<v Speaker 3>So that was going to be there double blind.</v>

2135
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.640
<v Speaker 3>And then they went through the Good Friday service and Walter Pankey who did the</v>

2136
01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:44.311
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>

2137
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.770
<v Speaker 3>was a doctor or a minister and getting a phd at Harvard.</v>

2138
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.940
<v Speaker 3>And he had spent a year going through the world's mystical literature to develop</v>

2139
01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:53.730
<v Speaker 3>a questionnaire for what the mystical experience was.</v>

2140
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.650
<v Speaker 3>And he extracted all specific mentions of,</v>

2141
01:07:59.050 --> 01:07:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2142
01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Jesus or Moses or it's just more of this abstract,</v>

2143
01:08:02.671 --> 01:08:06.870
<v Speaker 3>what is a mystical experience and administered this questionnaire.</v>

2144
01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:11.871
<v Speaker 3>And nine out of the 20 people had either a partial or a full mystical experience</v>

2145
01:08:12.931 --> 01:08:15.150
<v Speaker 3>and eight out of those nine had the psilocybin.</v>

2146
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>And so the conclusion was that for people who are religiously inclined in a</v>

2147
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:20.660
<v Speaker 3>religious setting,</v>

2148
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 3>you can have a psychedelic drugs.</v>

2149
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Psilocybin does precipitate what seems to be a genuine mystical experience,</v>

2150
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>not a hallucination,</v>

2151
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.130
<v Speaker 3>but in the mystical literature,</v>

2152
01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>the real test is called the fruits test is what does it you bring back,</v>

2153
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.710
<v Speaker 3>what are the fruits of this experience?</v>

2154
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 3>And that only comes with time.</v>

2155
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 3>And Mulder Pankey who did the study died from a scuba diving diving accident in</v>

2156
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>1971 and so he would have done this,</v>

2157
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 3>but in the middle eighties when I was getting my undergraduate degree,</v>

2158
01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I decided to track these people down for my senior thesis at New College of</v>

2159
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>

2160
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 3>which is this experimental school.</v>

2161
01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 3>And my father was really helpful.</v>

2162
01:08:58.881 --> 01:08:59.511
<v Speaker 3>My mother was too.</v>

2163
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I identified 19 out of the 20 and was able to interview 16 of them.</v>

2164
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 3>And what I found was that the people who had the placebo,</v>

2165
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:10.370
<v Speaker 3>most of them didn't remember it that vividly,</v>

2166
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 3>but the people who had the silicide bun had very vivid memories of parts of it.</v>

2167
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:19.520
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time they said that they considered it to be a genuine</v>

2168
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:23.480
<v Speaker 3>experience that had non drug mystical experiences since they preferred the</v>

2169
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:26.990
<v Speaker 3>non-drug mystical experiences cause they were more uniformly positive.</v>

2170
01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 3>They lost their fear of death and they felt more focused on the here and now and</v>

2171
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:36.230
<v Speaker 3>on social justice cause they had this unit of experience that helped them</v>

2172
01:09:36.231 --> 01:09:38.660
<v Speaker 3>identify with the planet,</v>

2173
01:09:38.661 --> 01:09:39.321
<v Speaker 3>with the people,</v>

2174
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 3>with not so much that all the divisions that divide us,</v>

2175
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 3>they saw deeper unity.</v>

2176
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And so they were more social justice minded and activists.</v>

2177
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a little bit of a key to the 60s as psychedelics go.</v>

2178
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.054
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2179
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.240
<v Speaker 3>They inspire people to try to make a better world and we can do that.</v>

2180
01:09:58.581 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Not In an oppositional way,</v>

2181
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.720
<v Speaker 3>but we can do it with in the heart of the culture.</v>

2182
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's the challenge that we face.</v>

2183
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 7>It's really interesting that you said that what they had was a real religious</v>

2184
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 7>experience or real mystical experience.</v>

2185
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2186
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 7>one of the things has been on my mind,</v>

2187
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2188
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:18.230
<v Speaker 7>over the last few months when it comes to psychedelic parents is that when</v>

2189
01:10:18.231 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 7>people want to tell you,</v>

2190
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.551
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2191
01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 7>you're just,</v>

2192
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.490
<v Speaker 7>something is going on,</v>

2193
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.700
<v Speaker 7>your imagination,</v>

2194
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:23.241
<v Speaker 7>you create,</v>

2195
01:10:23.241 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 7>your visual Cortex is getting stimulated by this drug and it's creating a bunch</v>

2196
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:28.430
<v Speaker 7>of hallucinations.</v>

2197
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.410
<v Speaker 7>It could be that,</v>

2198
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.900
<v Speaker 7>but it also could be something else.</v>

2199
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:38.230
<v Speaker 7>It could be you are experiencing some divine state of consciousness.</v>

2200
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:43.571
<v Speaker 7>You are in contact with some other form of intelligence and either it's a</v>

2201
01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 7>hallucination or it's this other real experience.</v>

2202
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:52.010
<v Speaker 7>But either way you have the exact same experience.</v>

2203
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.910
<v Speaker 7>Whether you really went to a place and talked to super spiritual,</v>

2204
01:10:55.911 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 7>highly intelligent beings,</v>

2205
01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 7>or you imagined you did,</v>

2206
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 7>you're still having the exact same experience.</v>

2207
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 7>And it's incredibly vivid.</v>

2208
01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 7>That's the one of the weirdest aspects about any sort of psychedelic experiences</v>

2210
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 7>that they're almost more real than reality itself.</v>

2211
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think because that it's even more important that we keep our critical</v>

2212
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:20.871
<v Speaker 3>faculties in a way because we are always a filter and our culture,</v>

2213
01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 3>how are,</v>

2214
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think we're ever seeing absolute reality or the truth.</v>

2215
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's where you get in danger where people think,</v>

2216
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2217
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2218
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:29.851
<v Speaker 3>God spoke to me,</v>

2219
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:34.851
<v Speaker 3>God said this or I know this for sure because there is our filter that we're</v>

2220
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:36.151
<v Speaker 3>seeing it through.</v>

2221
01:11:36.151 --> 01:11:39.420
<v Speaker 3>But you try to see as much as you can.</v>

2222
01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:42.070
<v Speaker 3>But I think we have to be aware that,</v>

2223
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2224
01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 3>and be cautious and see how it works in life.</v>

2225
01:11:45.751 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 3>So under LSD therapy and Mtma therapy would tell people don't make decisions</v>

2226
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>while you're doing the therapy,</v>

2227
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:52.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2228
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:55.460
<v Speaker 3>wait for a couple of weeks after or you know,</v>

2229
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 3>at least under the influence is for exploring,</v>

2230
01:11:58.021 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 3>not for deciding.</v>

2231
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2232
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:01.140
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2233
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Although some things do get changed</v>

2234
01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>cause sometimes though you have,</v>

2235
01:12:04.301 --> 01:12:04.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2236
01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you have like a really obvious reaction where,</v>

2237
01:12:08.051 --> 01:12:08.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2238
01:12:08.531 --> 01:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you're very aware that,</v>

2239
01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.870
<v Speaker 1>okay this is,</v>

2240
01:12:10.871 --> 01:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>this is what needs to be done and I need to do this right away.</v>

2241
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 3>But it does happen.</v>

2243
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:20.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the more vivid examples for me was when I was sitting for</v>

2245
01:12:20.381 --> 01:12:22.120
<v Speaker 3>someone who is doing Mtma,</v>

2246
01:12:22.121 --> 01:12:22.990
<v Speaker 3>he was a physician.</v>

2247
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:25.870
<v Speaker 3>And during the experience,</v>

2248
01:12:25.871 --> 01:12:27.430
<v Speaker 3>his arm became paralyzed,</v>

2249
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.980
<v Speaker 3>completely paralyzed and stop working.</v>

2250
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.060
<v Speaker 3>And we were like,</v>

2251
01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:36.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not permanent and it's,</v>

2252
01:12:36.431 --> 01:12:37.570
<v Speaker 3>it's psychosomatic.</v>

2253
01:12:37.571 --> 01:12:38.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't really need to,</v>

2254
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2255
01:12:39.281 --> 01:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't need to take you to the hospital.</v>

2256
01:12:40.631 --> 01:12:42.940
<v Speaker 3>And he was a doctor and his arm was paralyzed.</v>

2257
01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:47.020
<v Speaker 3>And over time he told this story that lasted a couple of hours.</v>

2258
01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:52.021
<v Speaker 3>But the story was that he as was with his mother and his siblings at the bedside</v>

2259
01:12:53.231 --> 01:12:55.810
<v Speaker 3>of their father who was dying and all of this life support.</v>

2260
01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:59.680
<v Speaker 3>And they had this discussion about whether they should pull the plug or not.</v>

2261
01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2262
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:03.520
<v Speaker 3>and because he was the doctor and they decided that they would,</v>

2263
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.280
<v Speaker 3>and so he actually pulled the plug in.</v>

2264
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 3>The complicating thing was that he hated his father and he wasn't really sure it</v>

2265
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:15.880
<v Speaker 3>was this his anger at his dad or was this what his mother really wanted.</v>

2266
01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:21.150
<v Speaker 3>So as he explored this emotionally complex issue and realized he really didn't</v>

2267
01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:23.681
<v Speaker 3>kill his dad,</v>

2268
01:13:23.681 --> 01:13:26.140
<v Speaker 3>he did what his mother and his siblings were saying.</v>

2269
01:13:26.141 --> 01:13:26.974
<v Speaker 3>It was humane.</v>

2270
01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>The feelings started coming back to his arm.</v>

2271
01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:29.651
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2272
01:13:29.651 --> 01:13:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So that was the arm that pulled the plug?</v>

2273
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2274
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real plug that actually I thought was can be done,</v>

2275
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but you know there depends on it.</v>

2276
01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2277
01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

2278
01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.590
<v Speaker 1>good for her because like pulling the plug is the expression.</v>

2279
01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:45.610
<v Speaker 1>But what a fucking stupid if life support systems were really like you just go</v>

2280
01:13:45.611 --> 01:13:46.910
<v Speaker 1>back there and unplug it.</v>

2281
01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how they shot him on.</v>

2282
01:13:48.831 --> 01:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Well we never,</v>

2283
01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to kill people so we don't have an off button.</v>

2284
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.670
<v Speaker 1>So you have to just pull the plug.</v>

2285
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Like really silly expression is true today.</v>

2286
01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You said something that I thought was really interesting too where you said that</v>

2287
01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:05.230
<v Speaker 1>in the 1960s you don't think people were ready for it.</v>

2288
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people were,</v>

2289
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that the culture wasn't,</v>

2290
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 3>and I think even if you read the</v>

2291
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.550
<v Speaker 4>electrical aid acid test,</v>

2292
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:18.730
<v Speaker 4>you know there there's ways in which people are damaged and left behind and</v>

2293
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.400
<v Speaker 4>that's something where I felt they weren't quite ready for that.</v>

2294
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:22.091
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the case?</v>

2295
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

2296
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Just with life in general,</v>

2297
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 4>there's always going to be people that are damaged and left behind.</v>

2298
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 4>Well I think one of the beautiful things about the marines and the military is</v>

2299
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:31.420
<v Speaker 4>that they don't leave anybody behind.</v>

2300
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the site that we should adopt that should be the psychedelic</v>

2301
01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 4>marines in a way,</v>

2302
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:38.470
<v Speaker 4>don't leave anybody behind.</v>

2303
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 4>That's really good advice.</v>

2304
01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Except there's some really annoying people out there and if you get hooked up</v>

2305
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:46.270
<v Speaker 4>with them and you know,</v>

2306
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

2307
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.660
<v Speaker 4>they can't carry their own weight psychically,</v>

2308
01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:50.471
<v Speaker 4>psychologically,</v>

2309
01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:51.304
<v Speaker 4>emotionally,</v>

2310
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 4>they're really fucking meeting.</v>

2311
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.860
<v Speaker 4>If certain point Tom,</v>

2312
01:14:53.861 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 4>you need to cut,</v>

2313
01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.890
<v Speaker 4>need to cut ties,</v>

2314
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 4>can't fix the whole world.</v>

2315
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that's really can't,</v>

2316
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:00.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2317
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:05.380
<v Speaker 4>you can't and you to tell people that they can is crazy talk right?</v>

2318
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:05.551
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2319
01:15:05.551 --> 01:15:07.960
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that are just broken animals,</v>

2320
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 4>you can't fix them.</v>

2321
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2322
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:12.460
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately they are not you and it's not me,</v>

2323
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.390
<v Speaker 4>but we both know people who say,</v>

2324
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.243
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2325
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 4>if you had like if there was a show,</v>

2326
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.600
<v Speaker 4>like a one of those fixed me up shows,</v>

2327
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:22.750
<v Speaker 4>you know they have those like home improvement shows or weight loss shows.</v>

2328
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.680
<v Speaker 4>If you had a guy who was just a complete fucking mess and they said,</v>

2329
01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:27.760
<v Speaker 4>just Rick Doblin,</v>

2330
01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:29.140
<v Speaker 4>this is your assignment for this show,</v>

2331
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:32.490
<v Speaker 4>you're going to take this guy and elevate his consciousness and,</v>

2332
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 4>and just make them a much better person because he could do it with a complete</v>

2333
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 4>idiot.</v>

2334
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Well I think the beauty of it is that people have to do part of it themselves</v>

2335
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.273
<v Speaker 4>and if they're,</v>

2336
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 4>and they own it and that's where they become empowered and if they want to fix</v>

2337
01:15:45.821 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 4>them without them taking the courage and maybe there's ways you can help them</v>

2338
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.680
<v Speaker 4>through drugs or through therapeutic alliance to have that path in mind.</v>

2339
01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2340
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.330
<v Speaker 4>They have to be willing to take certain kinds of steps forward.</v>

2341
01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:04.990
<v Speaker 4>And so that I think that is the beauty that we can't heal everybody,</v>

2342
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.400
<v Speaker 4>that they have to heal themselves.</v>

2343
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:11.430
<v Speaker 4>I think there's also a big danger as a human being in almost embracing the fact</v>

2344
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:16.570
<v Speaker 4>that you're not going to improve because it takes away all the pressure of</v>

2345
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 4>trying to improve all the self examination.</v>

2346
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you just say,</v>

2347
01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck,</v>

2348
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:23.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2349
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2350
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.840
<v Speaker 4>Do you really not give a fuck?</v>

2351
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Or do you,</v>

2352
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:31.780
<v Speaker 4>is that you're psychic shield to keep you from examining all the holes in your</v>

2353
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:32.091
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2354
01:16:32.091 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 4>the game?</v>

2355
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's more likely the case.</v>

2356
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Well we talked about the uh,</v>

2357
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 4>army veteran that committed suicide,</v>

2358
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 4>who wrote that letter.</v>

2359
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.360
<v Speaker 4>And one part of that letter was that he had felt like he would never get better.</v>

2360
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:46.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.750
<v Speaker 4>And I just kept thinking if he could have had an Mtma experience,</v>

2362
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.740
<v Speaker 4>would he still have been able to find,</v>

2363
01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.613
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2364
01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 4>some hope and a reason to live or would he still have committed suicide?</v>

2365
01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 4>And those are the questions.</v>

2366
01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.381
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2367
01:16:59.381 --> 01:16:59.701
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2368
01:16:59.701 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 4>he talked about 22 veterans a day are committing suicide.</v>

2369
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.630
<v Speaker 4>He was dealing with physical pain as well.</v>

2370
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a,</v>

2371
01:17:05.731 --> 01:17:08.530
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different things and that's where he was upset at.</v>

2372
01:17:08.531 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 4>The Dea I think also</v>

2373
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.420
<v Speaker 3>add,</v>

2374
01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:10.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2375
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.830
<v Speaker 3>pain meds and how they regulated pain meds.</v>

2376
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.270
<v Speaker 3>So I think the MTMA actually in combination with morphine,</v>

2377
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 3>it's been used in dying people,</v>

2378
01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:19.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2379
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 3>enhances the pain control.</v>

2380
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.210
<v Speaker 3>So MTMA has pain relieving qualities and when you combine it with morphine,</v>

2381
01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:27.044
<v Speaker 3>when people are,</v>

2382
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:28.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2383
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>in hospice settings,</v>

2384
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:29.894
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>

2385
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:34.640
<v Speaker 3>that you have better pain control and you don't need as much morphine and you</v>

2386
01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>start waking people up so that they're not tranquilized out and you open their</v>

2387
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 3>hearts so that people can have these beautiful,</v>

2388
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.721
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

2389
01:17:41.721 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 3>pretty much pain free experiences.</v>

2390
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a woman that wrote a book,</v>

2391
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:46.221
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2392
01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 3>honor thy daughter about her daughter who died in the early thirties from cancer</v>

2393
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 3>and how she had gone through a series of psychedelic therapy sessions as she was</v>

2394
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:55.034
<v Speaker 3>dying with,</v>

2395
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2396
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Mtma and mushrooms,</v>

2397
01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:57.441
<v Speaker 3>Lsd,</v>

2398
01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:58.460
<v Speaker 3>MD may combination,</v>

2399
01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:03.490
<v Speaker 3>but that it really enriched her daughter's life and she felt she needed to write</v>

2400
01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:04.890
<v Speaker 3>a book about,</v>

2401
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:06.230
<v Speaker 3>it's to let people know.</v>

2402
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the use of these drugs,</v>

2403
01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 3>when people are in pain,</v>

2404
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:12.080
<v Speaker 3>it's not just mental pain.</v>

2405
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole link between mental pain and physical pain and Mtma actually</v>

2406
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:18.350
<v Speaker 3>does help in this kind of,</v>

2407
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I see psychedelic medicine,</v>

2408
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic hospice will be pretty common,</v>

2409
01:18:23.691 --> 01:18:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I think 2030 years from now.</v>

2410
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.280
<v Speaker 3>And we'll look back and think that,</v>

2411
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2412
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 3>it made sense 50 years ago.</v>

2413
01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2414
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.820
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely does.</v>

2415
01:18:30.821 --> 01:18:31.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2416
01:18:31.031 --> 01:18:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the best uses for them to give people like a,</v>

2417
01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember Larry Hagman who died a,</v>

2418
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:40.610
<v Speaker 1>was on CNN and uh,</v>

2419
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:41.501
<v Speaker 1>died recently.</v>

2420
01:18:41.501 --> 01:18:42.334
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>

2421
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2422
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I never got to meet him,</v>

2423
01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:45.640
<v Speaker 1>but I really loved his interviews.</v>

2424
01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:49.390
<v Speaker 1>He was so candid and just warm and friendly.</v>

2425
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about the importance of a,</v>

2426
01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:52.720
<v Speaker 1>an acid trip to the,</v>

2427
01:18:52.721 --> 01:18:55.540
<v Speaker 1>had that where it took away his fear of dying.</v>

2428
01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:55.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2429
01:18:55.701 --> 01:18:56.381
<v Speaker 1>it was a joy.</v>

2430
01:18:56.381 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Paccar and CNN.</v>

2431
01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:58.630
<v Speaker 1>That was fantastic.</v>

2432
01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic interview.</v>

2433
01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It really was because he wasn't saying it like he was a Kook.</v>

2434
01:19:03.881 --> 01:19:04.714
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>

2435
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:08.200
<v Speaker 1>is explaining what it did and why I did that.</v>

2436
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And you believe them,</v>

2437
01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:09.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2438
01:19:09.821 --> 01:19:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you really did believe him.</v>

2439
01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:11.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2440
01:19:11.341 --> 01:19:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I spent years trying to meet him because I knew that he had done LSD therapy in</v>

2441
01:19:16.141 --> 01:19:16.771
<v Speaker 3>the 60s.</v>

2442
01:19:16.771 --> 01:19:18.540
<v Speaker 3>And he wrote about it in his autobiography.</v>

2443
01:19:18.541 --> 01:19:20.730
<v Speaker 3>And My mother in law actually sent me this message saying,</v>

2444
01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Larry Hagman has done LSD.</v>

2445
01:19:22.951 --> 01:19:27.180
<v Speaker 3>So then I started trying to find them and eventually I did meet him and we got</v>

2446
01:19:27.181 --> 01:19:31.380
<v Speaker 3>to be friends and he was a donor to maps and he wrote this,</v>

2447
01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2448
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:33.143
<v Speaker 3>he helped us in a lot,</v>

2449
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.140
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different ways,</v>

2450
01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:38.880
<v Speaker 3>and he was so human that he would be from Jr and known all over the world.</v>

2451
01:19:38.881 --> 01:19:39.900
<v Speaker 3>But when you were with him,</v>

2452
01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:41.850
<v Speaker 3>he just was present,</v>

2453
01:19:41.851 --> 01:19:42.391
<v Speaker 3>present,</v>

2454
01:19:42.391 --> 01:19:42.581
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2455
01:19:42.581 --> 01:19:43.414
<v Speaker 3>and he wasn't,</v>

2456
01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:43.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2457
01:19:43.921 --> 01:19:44.731
<v Speaker 3>ego inflated.</v>

2458
01:19:44.731 --> 01:19:46.620
<v Speaker 3>And he was just a really nice person.</v>

2459
01:19:46.621 --> 01:19:47.440
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2460
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.273
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2461
01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I felt that,</v>

2462
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 3>that he had this idealism and this joy from his whole life,</v>

2463
01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but he also really valued his psychedelic experiences,</v>

2464
01:19:58.891 --> 01:20:00.480
<v Speaker 3>his experiences with Mtma,</v>

2465
01:20:00.481 --> 01:20:01.950
<v Speaker 3>it's experiences with marijuana.</v>

2466
01:20:01.951 --> 01:20:06.840
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of ironic that someone who was so valued by the culture,</v>

2467
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2468
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.180
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be open about that,</v>

2469
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:10.600
<v Speaker 3>that he had to keep that hidden.</v>

2470
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.961
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2471
01:20:10.961 --> 01:20:12.520
<v Speaker 7>he did for a long time until,</v>

2472
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:13.820
<v Speaker 7>until he wrote that book.</v>

2473
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:14.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:14.651
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:20:14.651 --> 01:20:16.270
<v Speaker 7>The Joy Bihar experience.</v>

2476
01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:18.250
<v Speaker 7>But I think also it's like the,</v>

2477
01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:18.820
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2478
01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.130
<v Speaker 7>the atmosphere for an actor.</v>

2479
01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.440
<v Speaker 7>Actors get picked for things.</v>

2480
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.420
<v Speaker 7>And if you're very controversial,</v>

2481
01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:25.720
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2482
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.040
<v Speaker 7>for every Charlie Sheen,</v>

2483
01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.020
<v Speaker 7>and of course we're dealing with 2013 were Charlie.</v>

2484
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:31.150
<v Speaker 7>She can get away with being,</v>

2485
01:20:31.151 --> 01:20:31.691
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy.</v>

2486
01:20:31.691 --> 01:20:35.590
<v Speaker 7>Coke snorting whoremonger and like he just wears it and owns it.</v>

2487
01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.840
<v Speaker 7>For that to be a thing 20 years ago for an actor,</v>

2488
01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:42.400
<v Speaker 7>it could be a career killer.</v>

2489
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:42.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.770
<v Speaker 7>And when he was doing Dallas,</v>

2491
01:20:44.771 --> 01:20:45.071
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2492
01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:45.221
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2493
01:20:45.221 --> 01:20:48.670
<v Speaker 7>the consciousness of the public's opinion on,</v>

2494
01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:52.510
<v Speaker 7>on psychedelics was very much different than it is today.</v>

2495
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:52.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:53.121
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2497
01:20:53.121 --> 01:20:53.811
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2498
01:20:53.811 --> 01:20:54.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2499
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:59.530
<v Speaker 3>in Dallas when Mtma first became a party drug and it was used at the stark club</v>

2500
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.730
<v Speaker 3>of which there's a documentary that sort of the explosion of MDA,</v>

2501
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>the transformation from MDA as a secret quiet,</v>

2502
01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:09.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2503
01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:14.440
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic drug used underground isn't quite right cause it was still legal,</v>

2504
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:19.220
<v Speaker 3>but it was used in a quiet way for fear that if it became known it would become</v>

2505
01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:19.700
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

2506
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.230
<v Speaker 3>And then in Dallas it started being used and distributed by different people in</v>

2507
01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:27.080
<v Speaker 3>nightclub settings and go to Dallas was the place,</v>

2508
01:21:27.081 --> 01:21:27.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2509
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Dallas was the place and there's a documentary about the star club and there's</v>

2510
01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:32.870
<v Speaker 3>interviews with Larry Hagman in there.</v>

2511
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:37.270
<v Speaker 3>And what he's talking about is this a discussion he had with one of the,</v>

2512
01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:37.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2513
01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:42.350
<v Speaker 3>police officers in Dallas and they were saying that Larry had caused them to</v>

2514
01:21:42.351 --> 01:21:43.760
<v Speaker 3>lose lots and lots of money.</v>

2515
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.961
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2516
01:21:44.961 --> 01:21:45.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2517
01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:47.240
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean I cause you to lose lots and lots of money?</v>

2518
01:21:47.241 --> 01:21:47.481
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2519
01:21:47.481 --> 01:21:48.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2520
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:49.730
<v Speaker 3>after MD may became illegal,</v>

2521
01:21:49.731 --> 01:21:54.140
<v Speaker 3>we were going to bust the star club and we had this whole tactical team and</v>

2522
01:21:54.141 --> 01:21:55.040
<v Speaker 3>everything was set to go.</v>

2523
01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And then you and some friends came in.</v>

2524
01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:58.221
<v Speaker 3>It's a party.</v>

2525
01:21:58.221 --> 01:22:03.221
<v Speaker 3>They're not necessarily to take MTMA and so we didn't want to bust Larry Hagman</v>

2526
01:22:03.681 --> 01:22:04.550
<v Speaker 3>from Dallas.</v>

2527
01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a land.</v>

2528
01:22:05.471 --> 01:22:08.600
<v Speaker 3>So we had to call off the bus and then come back and do it another time.</v>

2529
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.763
<v Speaker 3>One more time.</v>

2530
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:13.730
<v Speaker 7>More and more rather evidence at times have changed because today there'd be</v>

2531
01:22:13.731 --> 01:22:15.410
<v Speaker 7>psyched to bus Larry Hagman,</v>

2532
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:15.981
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2533
01:22:15.981 --> 01:22:17.570
<v Speaker 7>if was like some dude like that,</v>

2534
01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 7>like don't make it Larry Hagman making,</v>

2535
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I know some other female star,</v>

2536
01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.800
<v Speaker 3>he didn't necessarily have anything that they could bust him on,</v>

2537
01:22:23.801 --> 01:22:24.970
<v Speaker 3>but he was so nice.</v>

2538
01:22:24.971 --> 01:22:27.520
<v Speaker 3>He led us to auction off a dinner with him,</v>

2539
01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:28.721
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2540
01:22:28.721 --> 01:22:31.000
<v Speaker 3>as a donation to maps and this couple,</v>

2541
01:22:31.001 --> 01:22:31.834
<v Speaker 3>and also Andy,</v>

2542
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Andy Weil did that too.</v>

2543
01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:34.120
<v Speaker 3>So we had a dinner,</v>

2544
01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:34.780
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

2545
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.520
<v Speaker 3>the deal they made is I had to come a long Ah,</v>

2546
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.111
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2547
01:22:38.111 --> 01:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>that would be great to do that.</v>

2548
01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Why would a great dinner.</v>

2549
01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Who'd you guys eat dinner with?</v>

2551
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:44.223
<v Speaker 3>This group,</v>

2552
01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.000
<v Speaker 3>this family from Canada.</v>

2553
01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2554
01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:49.330
<v Speaker 3>they were just ordinary people,</v>

2555
01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:50.770
<v Speaker 3>but they had one of them.</v>

2556

<v Speaker 3>The woman had struggled with cancer had they were,</v>

01:23:00.311 --> 01:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>He was on I dream of Jeannie.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And we had such a nice time at the dinner.</v>

2563
01:23:04.391 --> 01:23:05.224
<v Speaker 3>They also,</v>

2564
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 3>the dinner with Andy Weil,</v>

2565
01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:07.421

2566
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:08.760
<v Speaker 4>The boss on I Janie,</v>

2567
01:23:08.761 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 4>Janie.</v>

2568
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 4>And now he was the astronauts.</v>

2569
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:10.921
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2570
01:23:10.921 --> 01:23:11.470
<v Speaker 4>It's the other guy.</v>

2571
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 4>He was the main character.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Very in love with Barbara Eden.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2574
01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I always get them confused with bewitched.</v>

2576
01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:19.661
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

2577
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 4>I dream of Jeannie and bewitched confused there.</v>

2578
01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 4>There he is.</v>

2579
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.003
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2580
01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>

2581
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 4>which was the one where they had a different dude,</v>

2582
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.520
<v Speaker 4>like they killed off the dude and brought in the same,</v>

2583
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:30.860
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2584
01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.211
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2585
01:23:31.211 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 4>That was same name,</v>

2586
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 4>different guy.</v>

2587
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I think now that Larry is the gun,</v>

2588
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I can share that.</v>

2589
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:37.414
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2590
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 4>he had a bond that was made like the bottle that she lived in.</v>

2591
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:43.203
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2592
01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.910
<v Speaker 4>that'd be worth a long weekend.</v>

2593
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.730
<v Speaker 4>And we got to smoke pot together in this genie genie bottle and he said that</v>

2594
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 4>somebody had talked to him about marketing it and making lots of them and he</v>

2595
01:23:55.061 --> 01:23:55.301
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2596
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:55.541
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2597
01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want to have that done.</v>

2598
01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:57.993
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2599
01:23:58.090 --> 01:23:58.871
<v Speaker 4>that's too bad.</v>

2600
01:23:58.871 --> 01:23:59.651
<v Speaker 4>We're going to make it now.</v>

2601
01:23:59.651 --> 01:24:01.030
<v Speaker 4>But sorry.</v>

2602
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 4>But then the family,</v>

2603
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.910
<v Speaker 4>he was so nice with this family and just,</v>

2604
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 4>and also with me just treat us as like,</v>

2605
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2606
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.341
<v Speaker 4>part of his family.</v>

2607
01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:13.660
<v Speaker 4>We had dinners kitchen that when it came time for the dinner with Andy,</v>

2608
01:24:13.661 --> 01:24:18.661
<v Speaker 4>while that the family invited Larry and he came with a friend of his to help</v>

2609
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 4>them travel and we ended up just a few months before he died,</v>

2610
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:27.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2611
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.660
<v Speaker 4>going up and see planes and stuff onto this island where Andy Weil lives and</v>

2612
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:34.480
<v Speaker 4>having this really wonderful experience.</v>

2613
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.433
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

2614
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2615
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:36.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2616
01:24:36.551 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 4>I think guys like him that do those sorts of interviews,</v>

2617
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:42.280
<v Speaker 4>that's a really,</v>

2618
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.460
<v Speaker 4>really important thing because the public's perception of people who do LSD is</v>

2619
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:50.850
<v Speaker 4>almost entirely limited to fuck ups and you know,</v>

2620
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 4>and crazy people and wild people.</v>

2621
01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Or they used to do acid.</v>

2622
01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:55.661
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2623
01:24:55.661 --> 01:24:56.950
<v Speaker 4>this guy used to do acid,</v>

2624
01:24:56.951 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 4>he did acid back off his rocker.</v>

2625
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:01.870
<v Speaker 4>You never hear about it.</v>

2626
01:25:01.871 --> 01:25:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Positive drug experience like that from a very respected person.</v>

2627
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:05.951
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2628
01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:09.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we need is the coming out of loads of people like that who are</v>

2629
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.570
<v Speaker 4>retiring baby boomers.</v>

2630
01:25:11.571 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 4>So I think time is on our side.</v>

2631
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:17.050
<v Speaker 4>There's all these people who are more fearless because they're not worried about</v>

2632
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:19.240
<v Speaker 4>what they tell their kids or they're not worried about their jobs.</v>

2633
01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:22.360
<v Speaker 4>They've made a reputation and they can talk like Steve Jobs.</v>

2634
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.730
<v Speaker 4>I had a wonderful opportunity,</v>

2635
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I tried for years and finally managed to have a half hour conversation with him</v>

2636
01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 4>about our LSD study.</v>

2637
01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Did he give you like a half an hour on an iPhone and go,</v>

2638
01:25:32.741 --> 01:25:34.290
<v Speaker 4>ready press star.</v>

2639
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.140
<v Speaker 4>Is it facetime?</v>

2640
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Cause Start 29,</v>

2641
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:39.370
<v Speaker 4>28 before I had an iPhone.</v>

2642
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.510
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2643
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have an iPhone when you met him.</v>

2644
01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:42.431
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

2645
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:43.091
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't meet him.</v>

2646
01:25:43.091 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 4>It was just on the fun.</v>

2647
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.273
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2648
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 4>at the end of it he said,</v>

2649
01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:47.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2650
01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Speaker 4>send me a proposal.</v>

2651
01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:49.773
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2652
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I didn't never heard back.</v>

2653
01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't known for being philanthropic,</v>

2654
01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:56.110
<v Speaker 4>but I had gotten a letter from Albert Hoffman to him,</v>

2655
01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:57.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2656
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:57.881
<v Speaker 4>on his,</v>

2657
01:25:57.881 --> 01:25:58.714
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2658
01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 4>after it 102nd birthday.</v>

2659
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2660
01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.021
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2661
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:02.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2662
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll say acid lives to be one or</v>

2663
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.873
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

2664
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 3>And he was married for over 70 years.</v>

2665
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>The same person.</v>

2666
01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2667
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:10.400
<v Speaker 3>he led,</v>

2668
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:10.641
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2669
01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Albert Hoffman to pivot just for a second was such a perfect example.</v>

2670
01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:19.490
<v Speaker 3>We're so fortunate that he's the one that invented LSD because he was</v>

2671
01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:20.661
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2672
01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 3>What I'm trying to talk about in terms of integrating,</v>

2673
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:25.790
<v Speaker 3>he was a big successful chemist for a major pharmaceutical company.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sandoz.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's sold hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

2677
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:30.890
<v Speaker 3>He lived in more or less than the same place.</v>

2678
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:33.200
<v Speaker 3>He had a wife for over 70 years.</v>

2679
01:26:33.201 --> 01:26:34.070
<v Speaker 3>He had children,</v>

2680

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I was fortunately able to be with the Albert when they tried to MDA for the</v>

2685
01:26:45.321 --> 01:26:46.154
<v Speaker 3>first time.</v>

2694
01:27:02.031 --> 01:27:03.890
<v Speaker 3>experience with Lsd.</v>

2695

<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have,</v>

2696
01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:05.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2697
01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Have you done any tests with like candy flipping,</v>

2699
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:09.224
<v Speaker 3>like mixing,</v>

2700
01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2701
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 3>acid?</v>

2702
01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2703
01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe that that actually has incredible therapeutic potential.</v>

2704
01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2705
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:22.450
<v Speaker 3>however we've not actually tested it because in the scientific world you want</v>

2706
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:25.040
<v Speaker 3>just one variable if possible.</v>

2707
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 3>And so to combine LSD and Mtma,</v>

2708
01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:31.490
<v Speaker 3>which drug are we trying to make a medicine and are always going to combine</v>

2709
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:31.731
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2710
01:27:31.731 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 3>but I honestly,</v>

2711
01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 3>it becomes legal.</v>

2712
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 3>That would be I think maybe even before,</v>

2713
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:37.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2714
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 3>that's the question.</v>

2715
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2716
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:43.870
<v Speaker 3>it maybe it's 10 years before these drugs can become medicalized legal in a</v>

2717
01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>medical way.</v>

2718
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that that long,</v>

2719
01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:46.481
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2720
01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2721
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you really think it could be sooner.</v>

2722
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that's possible now more than ever.</v>

2723
01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:55.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain track of data that you have to produce a certain set of</v>

2724
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:58.400
<v Speaker 3>requirements that were on the track of doing.</v>

2725
01:27:58.401 --> 01:28:01.040
<v Speaker 3>But it looks to me like it's eight to 10 years,</v>

2726
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>even if it was certainly,</v>

2727
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:02.894
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2728
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2729
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I've always been wrong.</v>

2730
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I've always been wrong.</v>

2731
01:28:06.201 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>And I've always underestimated how long it takes you more.</v>

2732
01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:09.794
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about earlier</v>

2733
01:28:09.810 --> 01:28:10.560
<v Speaker 7>gay rights.</v>

2734
01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.490
<v Speaker 7>I think they equate,</v>

2735
01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.430
<v Speaker 7>cause when I was a kid,</v>

2736
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.200
<v Speaker 7>I remember I was living in San Francisco,</v>

2737
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2738
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:18.600
<v Speaker 7>from seven til 11.</v>

2739
01:28:18.601 --> 01:28:19.111
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2740
01:28:19.111 --> 01:28:21.600
<v Speaker 7>it was around a lot of gay people and uh,</v>

2741
01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.420
<v Speaker 7>it was completely normal because that was just what I was around.</v>

2742
01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:26.610
<v Speaker 7>And then when I moved to Florida,</v>

2743
01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:27.510
<v Speaker 7>when I was 11,</v>

2744
01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.960
<v Speaker 7>my friend candy is Candido is or Cuban kid,</v>

2745
01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 7>his dad was really pissed off with the newspaper,</v>

2746
01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:36.630
<v Speaker 7>slams it down and he was,</v>

2747
01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:37.710
<v Speaker 7>he was mad that,</v>

2748
01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:38.050
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2749
01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:38.321
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2750
01:28:38.321 --> 01:28:39.870
<v Speaker 7>the fags wanted to get married.</v>

2751
01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:40.830
<v Speaker 7>That's what he kept saying,</v>

2752
01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:41.941
<v Speaker 7>I believe this shit,</v>

2753
01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:43.050
<v Speaker 7>these fags want to get married.</v>

2754
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:44.640
<v Speaker 7>And then I remember I was like 11.</v>

2755
01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:45.001
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2756
01:28:45.001 --> 01:28:45.301
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>

2757
01:28:45.301 --> 01:28:46.170
<v Speaker 7>Why do you care?</v>

2758
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:46.920
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2759
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:47.101
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2760
01:28:47.101 --> 01:28:48.120
<v Speaker 7>you're a grown man.</v>

2761
01:28:48.121 --> 01:28:48.721
<v Speaker 7>Like this is what,</v>

2762
01:28:48.721 --> 01:28:50.180
<v Speaker 7>how stupid some grown manner.</v>

2763
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:50.881
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

2764
01:28:50.881 --> 01:28:52.350
<v Speaker 7>that's a weird argument.</v>

2765
01:28:52.351 --> 01:28:53.670
<v Speaker 7>Like that's a strange thing.</v>

2766
01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.380
<v Speaker 7>So that was,</v>

2767
01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2768
01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:57.240
<v Speaker 7>a long ass time ago.</v>

2769
01:28:57.241 --> 01:28:58.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm 45 years old now,</v>

2770
01:28:58.231 --> 01:29:00.870
<v Speaker 7>so I was 34 years ago and um,</v>

2771
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:01.621
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2772
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:02.520
<v Speaker 7>I know it's not,</v>

2773
01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2774
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:04.750
<v Speaker 7>it is.</v>

2775
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2776
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.230
<v Speaker 7>But it's the idea that that back then it was,</v>

2777
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.720
<v Speaker 7>it was really something that people fought against.</v>

2778
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:14.030
<v Speaker 7>It was really a,</v>

2779
01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:16.290
<v Speaker 7>a subject of you could,</v>

2780
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:20.250
<v Speaker 7>you could be public about it and not feel like an ignorant asshole.</v>

2781
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:24.300
<v Speaker 7>Whereas today if you say that you're against gay people being married,</v>

2782
01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 7>like you're nothing but a fool,</v>

2783
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2784
01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.330
<v Speaker 7>You're nothing but a full,</v>

2785
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:27.910
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

2786
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:28.181
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2787
01:29:28.181 --> 01:29:32.370
<v Speaker 7>you honestly think it's either you're crazy with religion and you honestly</v>

2788
01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:33.780
<v Speaker 7>thanked that somehow or another,</v>

2789
01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:37.170
<v Speaker 7>it's possible to cure person of being gay.</v>

2790
01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:39.480
<v Speaker 7>And if they believe in the scripture that's,</v>

2791
01:29:39.481 --> 01:29:40.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2792
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 7>that I can't even talk to you.</v>

2793
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.900
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

2794
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.950
<v Speaker 7>that's a different animal.</v>

2795
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:47.910
<v Speaker 7>But if you're a rational person and you accept the fact that people were born</v>

2796
01:29:47.911 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 7>gang and you,</v>

2797
01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 7>you have an issue with them marrying their lover,</v>

2798
01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:53.100
<v Speaker 7>like you're a crazy person.</v>

2799
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I think though that people who are irrational,</v>

2801
01:29:56.781 --> 01:29:57.161
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

2802
01:29:57.161 --> 01:29:58.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

2803
01:29:58.251 --> 01:30:00.810
<v Speaker 3>How do we rationalize the ration?</v>

2804
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a way that they're fearful of something that blocks their</v>

2805
01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:08.300
<v Speaker 3>rational thinking and if you can somehow or other help them.</v>

2806
01:30:08.301 --> 01:30:11.960
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of people who are so anti gay are scared of their own gay</v>

2807
01:30:11.961 --> 01:30:12.381
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>

2808
01:30:12.381 --> 01:30:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a cliche,</v>

2809
01:30:13.281 --> 01:30:15.410
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's often the case.</v>

2810
01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.440
<v Speaker 3>But I think what drove me early on into an interest in psychedelics is that I</v>

2811
01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:26.801
<v Speaker 3>was so terrified of World War II and the Holocaust and how people can be so</v>

2812
01:30:27.561 --> 01:30:32.561
<v Speaker 3>blind or be willing to be so driven by irrational factors that I thought,</v>

2813
01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:37.460
<v Speaker 3>what can we do to try to help get to heal that?</v>

2814
01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Because some people,</v>

2815
01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:39.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2816
01:30:39.911 --> 01:30:40.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2817
01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:43.190
<v Speaker 3>they can be quite powerful and they can,</v>

2818
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2819
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:45.730
<v Speaker 3>how do you respond?</v>

2820
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:46.251
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

2821
01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:47.660
<v Speaker 3>that was the dilemma for me.</v>

2822
01:30:47.661 --> 01:30:48.890
<v Speaker 3>And I finally felt that,</v>

2823
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:49.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2824
01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.530
<v Speaker 3>growing up with the Vietnam war,</v>

2825
01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.280
<v Speaker 3>that that was something that now I was being called to fight and I decided to</v>

2826
01:30:55.281 --> 01:30:56.660
<v Speaker 3>become a draft resistor.</v>

2827
01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:02.290
<v Speaker 3>But I saw the nuclear standoff between the U S in Russia and it just seemed like</v>

2828
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:06.890
<v Speaker 3>the irrational was so powerful.</v>

2829
01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.660
<v Speaker 3>The demonization of the other.</v>

2830
01:31:08.661 --> 01:31:11.510
<v Speaker 3>And the making of the enemy that there was,</v>

2831
01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't figure out how to uh,</v>

2832
01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.490
<v Speaker 3>contribute to breaking through that cycle.</v>

2833
01:31:16.491 --> 01:31:17.930
<v Speaker 3>And it finally felt like this,</v>

2834
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.183
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2835
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:24.650
<v Speaker 3>deep spiritual experience of connection and letting people's fears come up where</v>

2836
01:31:24.651 --> 01:31:25.910
<v Speaker 3>they could look at them more.</v>

2837
01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:30.940
<v Speaker 3>That that would be for an individual make us more grounded and less likely to be</v>

2838
01:31:31.401 --> 01:31:33.320
<v Speaker 3>manipulated are irrational factors.</v>

2839
01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:36.320
<v Speaker 3>And if millions of people could have that experience,</v>

2840
01:31:36.321 --> 01:31:37.850
<v Speaker 3>which did happen during the 60s,</v>

2841
01:31:37.851 --> 01:31:39.110
<v Speaker 3>but if we can expand it,</v>

2842
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:44.530
<v Speaker 3>that maybe there is a basis to go through the crises that we're facing over the</v>

2843
01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:48.290
<v Speaker 3>next couple of decades as a species and as globalization and people are bumping</v>

2844
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:53.291
<v Speaker 3>up against each other that it felt like somehow or other the irrational is based</v>

2845
01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:58.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot on fear and how can we help people to counter that with love,</v>

2846
01:31:58.461 --> 01:32:02.020
<v Speaker 3>with hope or with looking with self acceptance.</v>

2847
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's where the MTMA is so useful that the fear of self criticism</v>

2848
01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:11.641
<v Speaker 3>or the fear that Mtma helps people to accept who they are and the LSD and the</v>

2849
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:13.451
<v Speaker 3>silicide bend,</v>

2850
01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:14.320
<v Speaker 3>the Iowasca,</v>

2851
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:15.100
<v Speaker 3>the masculine,</v>

2852
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:15.933
<v Speaker 3>the Payoti,</v>

2853
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:16.631
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2854
01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:17.464
<v Speaker 3>the drugs,</v>

2855
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 3>they are challenging in a different way.</v>

2856
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:25.410
<v Speaker 3>And that they do this dissolving of the control mechanisms and dissolving of the</v>

2857
01:32:26.471 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 3>ego and,</v>

2858
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully people can let go and blend and be strengthened from that.</v>

2859
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's the support that we need to provide to help that to be happening.</v>

2860
01:32:36.281 --> 01:32:37.114
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

2861
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2862
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>just the way that this religious fundamentalism against gay marriage,</v>

2863
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2864
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:45.670
<v Speaker 3>right now we have a crisis of fundamentalism around the world.</v>

2865
01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a crisis of ideology.</v>

2866
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2867
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2868
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:52.750
<v Speaker 4>and it's also a crisis of power because once someone gets into a position where</v>

2869
01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.310
<v Speaker 4>they can espouse their ideology,</v>

2870
01:32:54.311 --> 01:32:55.091
<v Speaker 4>you listen to them,</v>

2871
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:55.930
<v Speaker 4>that is power.</v>

2872
01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:58.330
<v Speaker 4>And then they use that power to get money,</v>

2873
01:32:58.331 --> 01:32:58.931
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate,</v>

2874
01:32:58.931 --> 01:32:59.651
<v Speaker 4>to get sex,</v>

2875
01:32:59.651 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 4>to do whatever the fuck they want and not pay taxes.</v>

2876
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of craziness.</v>

2877
01:33:03.581 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like in and not pay taxes thing.</v>

2878
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.300
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like they're in cahoots.</v>

2879
01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:08.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like the government has decided,</v>

2880
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:08.951
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2881
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:12.340
<v Speaker 4>it'd probably be beneficial if you guys did a good job and you know,</v>

2882
01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:15.640
<v Speaker 4>cult it up the shit out of some people and get them all whacked out on your</v>

2883
01:33:15.641 --> 01:33:20.050
<v Speaker 4>ideas to the point where they're complete fundamentalists on your idea.</v>

2884
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:22.030
<v Speaker 4>So how about you not paid taxes?</v>

2885
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2886
01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 4>how about we help you along there,</v>

2887
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:24.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2888
01:33:24.401 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 4>make it even more profitable,</v>

2889
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:28.960
<v Speaker 4>more susceptible to corruption?</v>

2890
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:30.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2891
01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:31.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that there,</v>

2892
01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:32.310
<v Speaker 4>there is that,</v>

2893
01:33:32.311 --> 01:33:33.144
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2894
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:36.640
<v Speaker 4>way in which the government can be influenced by groups.</v>

2895
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2896
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's something also that we have to be wary of some mess,</v>

2897
01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:45.160
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time we have to work through groups and work through government.</v>

2898
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:45.994
<v Speaker 4>So I think this,</v>

2899
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2900
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 4>one of the first things we learned at the Kennedy School is there is no,</v>

2901
01:33:49.331 --> 01:33:50.160
<v Speaker 4>the government,</v>

2902
01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:50.970
<v Speaker 4>it's like your body,</v>

2903
01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:51.341
<v Speaker 4>there is no,</v>

2904
01:33:51.341 --> 01:33:51.821
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>

2905
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 4>there's all these different organ systems.</v>

2906
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 4>They all work in different ways.</v>

2907
01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 4>So we find out about that when the government goes after itself.</v>

2908
01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>

2909
01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.640
<v Speaker 4>when this general Patraeus thing happened,</v>

2910
01:34:00.641 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 4>we found out the CIA and the FBI don't necessarily see eye to eye.</v>

2911
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2912
01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:05.450
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2913
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2914
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:07.480
<v Speaker 4>And that's where our strategy is built at.</v>

2915
01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:12.340
<v Speaker 4>The FDA is putting science over politics while the other forces are trying to</v>

2916
01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 4>either slow down or black research.</v>

2917
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 4>And where it comes with marijuana is that there's a government monopoly on the</v>

2918
01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 4>supply of marijuana that can be used in federal research.</v>

2919
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:25.540
<v Speaker 4>So even though there is no monopoly on the supply marijuana,</v>

2920
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:31.230
<v Speaker 4>the only kind that's been grown under DEA license is controlled by the national</v>

2921
01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:32.320
<v Speaker 4>institute on Drug Abuse.</v>

2922
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:33.220
<v Speaker 4>And it's hilarious.</v>

2923
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:37.720
<v Speaker 4>You want to get to do research to make marijuana into a medicine.</v>

2924
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:39.490
<v Speaker 4>The FDA will give you permission.</v>

2925
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:43.740
<v Speaker 4>We have a permission to do a study with marijuana in 50 veterans for post</v>

2926
01:34:43.741 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 4>traumatic stress disorder.</v>

2927
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.500
<v Speaker 4>And our distinction is that the marijuana is more about treating symptoms and</v>

2928
01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:53.170
<v Speaker 4>the Mtma is more about curing is getting.</v>

2929
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:57.050
<v Speaker 4>And then you only need Mtma a few times with the marijuana people sort of need</v>

2930
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

2931
01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2932
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 3>But we have FDA approval and Nada and the Public Health Service rejected the</v>

2933
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 3>protocol and refused to provide the marijuana for us.</v>

2934
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:10.841
<v Speaker 3>And they only can review protocols for marijuana because they've got sitting on</v>

2935
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 3>this monopoly and we were 12 years lawsuit and we won and won.</v>

2936
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And then we lost in the first circuit court of appeals to break the monopoly.</v>

2937
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:23.120
<v Speaker 3>But that's the core reason why we're not able to make progress with marijuana</v>

2938
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:25.880
<v Speaker 3>research and we are able to make progress with psychedelics.</v>

2939
01:35:25.881 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And are they afraid of with marijuana?</v>

2940
01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I think they're afraid of the whole drug war collapsing,</v>

2941
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 3>that the marijuana is incredibly demonized.</v>

2942
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It's widely used most.</v>

2943
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that know that it's not so dangerous.</v>

2944
01:35:40.731 --> 01:35:41.690
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's the,</v>

2945
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbol,</v>

2946
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbol of cultural rebellion.</v>

2947
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's where it was embedded in certain people's minds.</v>

2948
01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 3>And even though it was made illegal in 37 with the marijuana tax act,</v>

2949
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:56.570
<v Speaker 3>then it was illegal shortly after prohibition ended.</v>

2950
01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 3>And it was illegal during the depression and mostly it was Mexicans and blacks</v>

2951
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:02.264
<v Speaker 3>that smoked pot.</v>

2952
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.230
<v Speaker 3>And so it was a way to repress people who are competing for low wage jobs.</v>

2953
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It was a way to block the hemp industry,</v>

2954
01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.190
<v Speaker 3>various things like that.</v>

2955
01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2956
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:15.910
<v Speaker 3>but it largely was a minor thread in American history until the 60s and white</v>

2957
01:36:16.341 --> 01:36:17.360
<v Speaker 3>suburban people started,</v>

2958
01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.950
<v Speaker 3>kids started smoking pot and you had this massive explosion of pot and then pot</v>

2959
01:36:21.951 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 3>and LSD got associated with cultural rebellion.</v>

2960
01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.310
<v Speaker 3>And now all these years later,</v>

2961
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:29.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2962
01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:32.870
<v Speaker 3>there are many people that smoke pot that are at least out about that.</v>

2963
01:36:32.871 --> 01:36:34.360
<v Speaker 3>And it made a lot of contributions.</v>

2964
01:36:34.361 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's more now about fear of parents for their kids.</v>

2965
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:39.703
<v Speaker 3>It's shifted.</v>

2966
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:44.830
<v Speaker 3>But that's what's driving what's left of the drug war is parents wanting to</v>

2967
01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:49.370
<v Speaker 3>protect their kids and also all these vested interests that have the prison</v>

2968
01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 3>unions and things like that.</v>

2969
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.033
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2970
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.850
<v Speaker 3>but I think that dynamic we're trying to is shifting also.</v>

2971
01:36:55.910 --> 01:37:00.910
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a way in which those of us who were interested in enhancing our</v>

2972
01:37:01.131 --> 01:37:02.600
<v Speaker 3>lives with these drugs in positive,</v>

2973
01:37:02.601 --> 01:37:04.850
<v Speaker 3>responsible ways need to do so.</v>

2974
01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Need to speak about it,</v>

2975
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:09.140
<v Speaker 3>where possible and need to demonstrate that.</v>

2976
01:37:09.141 --> 01:37:10.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not about tearing down the society,</v>

2977
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:11.630
<v Speaker 3>it's strengthened.</v>

2978
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It's all of us coming together to face these incredible challenges and we need</v>

2979
01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:19.550
<v Speaker 3>all the inspiration and we need all the creativity and we need all the energy</v>

2980
01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:20.360
<v Speaker 3>that we can.</v>

2981
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.370
<v Speaker 7>So unfortunately for some people they really can't speak out about it because</v>

2982
01:37:23.371 --> 01:37:25.020
<v Speaker 7>they get drug tested at work.</v>

2983
01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:26.190
<v Speaker 7>That's a big issue.</v>

2984
01:37:26.191 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 7>I mean the,</v>

2985
01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.061
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2986
01:37:27.061 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2987
01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:27.381
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2988
01:37:27.381 --> 01:37:27.570
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2989
01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:30.840
<v Speaker 7>the idea that something that stays in your body as long as marijuana,</v>

2990
01:37:30.841 --> 01:37:31.651
<v Speaker 7>it gets tested.</v>

2991
01:37:31.651 --> 01:37:33.120
<v Speaker 7>When the psychoactive,</v>

2992
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:33.621
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2993
01:37:33.621 --> 01:37:33.961
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2994
01:37:33.961 --> 01:37:34.201
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2995
01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:38.220
<v Speaker 7>the time in which your body brings it back to baselines lines less than 24</v>

2996
01:37:38.221 --> 01:37:38.611
<v Speaker 7>hours,</v>

2997
01:37:38.611 --> 01:37:39.250
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2998
01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:40.310
<v Speaker 7>I mean is your,</v>

2999
01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>

3000
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:42.690
<v Speaker 7>you basically just have traced metabolites.</v>

3001
01:37:42.691 --> 01:37:44.430
<v Speaker 7>It stays in your system for a long ass time,</v>

3002
01:37:44.670 --> 01:37:45.870
<v Speaker 7>but they're not psychoactive.</v>

3003
01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.100
<v Speaker 7>So you're at work,</v>

3004
01:37:47.101 --> 01:37:47.431
<v Speaker 7>you get it.</v>

3005
01:37:47.431 --> 01:37:48.450
<v Speaker 7>You spoke to join on Friday,</v>

3006
01:37:48.451 --> 01:37:49.201
<v Speaker 7>you're at work on Monday.</v>

3007
01:37:49.201 --> 01:37:50.370
<v Speaker 7>Then like you take a piss test,</v>

3008
01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.080
<v Speaker 7>you piss positive.</v>

3009
01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:55.530
<v Speaker 7>They're penalizing you for something you're doing when you're not at work really</v>

3010
01:37:55.531 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 7>is not going to</v>

3011
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 4>affect work.</v>

3012
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 4>You can also be arrested for driving under the influence.</v>

3013
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3014
01:38:00.181 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 4>From metabolites that you took from pot a week ago.</v>

3015
01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:03.630
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3016
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 4>It's nonsense.</v>

3017
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:05.880
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

3018
01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 4>The idea that that,</v>

3019
01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:08.041
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3020
01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:08.930
<v Speaker 4>the idea that they treat,</v>

3021
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:12.990
<v Speaker 4>they have some arbitrary level that they test you for and they say,</v>

3022
01:38:12.991 --> 01:38:13.621
<v Speaker 4>well this is,</v>

3023
01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 4>you can't operate a marijuana vehicle vehicle on marijuana if you have this</v>

3024
01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:17.544
<v Speaker 4>function or system.</v>

3025
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:18.570
<v Speaker 4>It's been proven.</v>

3026
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 4>What tests have you done?</v>

3027
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:20.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3028
01:38:20.721 --> 01:38:22.800
<v Speaker 4>where's the science behind the national level?</v>

3029
01:38:22.801 --> 01:38:24.360
<v Speaker 4>When you look at the science,</v>

3030
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.070
<v Speaker 4>the experience,</v>

3031
01:38:26.071 --> 01:38:31.071
<v Speaker 4>marijuana smokers are not debilitated by in their driving and there's been a lot</v>

3032
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 4>of driving tests that had been done.</v>

3033
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:38.130
<v Speaker 4>And what they show is that when you are drinking alcohol and driving that you</v>

3034
01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:40.081
<v Speaker 4>are impaired,</v>

3035
01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 4>but you don't think you're impaired.</v>

3036
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:48.080
<v Speaker 4>And so you were more reckless that under a marijuana people know that sometimes</v>

3037
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:49.470
<v Speaker 4>their instincts,</v>

3038
01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 4>their reaction time might be slow.</v>

3039
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 4>So you take compensating action.</v>

3040
01:38:53.281 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 4>So people are more careful when they're driving and more aware.</v>

3041
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 4>So in driving,</v>

3042
01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.010
<v Speaker 4>not in simulators,</v>

3043
01:38:59.011 --> 01:39:03.210
<v Speaker 4>but when they're out in driving roads and cars that and in simulators to that</v>

3044
01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is very</v>

3045
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.500
<v Speaker 4>minimally affecting driving and you become paranoid.</v>

3046
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.490
<v Speaker 4>So you'd drive a little slower and,</v>

3047
01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 4>and you react a little slower to,</v>

3048
01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 4>and really you think you react slower physically?</v>

3049
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:18.121
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3050
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:19.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean by that that,</v>

3051
01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:19.321
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3052
01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:22.500
<v Speaker 4>cause I've a lot look at all these basketball players that you know,</v>

3053
01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:23.800
<v Speaker 4>tied into it.</v>

3054
01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.301
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3055
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:24.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3056
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 4>you didn't know about that Jujitsu.</v>

3057
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:27.270
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

3058
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:28.740
<v Speaker 4>Huge in the Jiu Jitsu community.</v>

3059
01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Massive snowboarding.</v>

3060
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.530
<v Speaker 4>A massive amount of people smoke pot and then go train the,</v>

3061
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.200
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3062
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:35.931
<v Speaker 4>it's so much.</v>

3063
01:39:35.931 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 4>So they have t shirts rolling all stoned,</v>

3064
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.230
<v Speaker 4>rolling stone.</v>

3065
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.370
<v Speaker 4>They have all these different,</v>

3066
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3067
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's so common in the janitor world.</v>

3068
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3069
01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:48.440
<v Speaker 4>I play racquetball and so I can have combined marijuana,</v>

3070
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 4>racquetball and train myself to be really quick reacting.</v>

3071
01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3072
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes I play my best games when I'm stoned and sometimes I don't</v>

3073
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:59.000
<v Speaker 4>give a fuck and it balls,</v>

3074
01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.910
<v Speaker 4>but I can never tell ahead of time whether it be better or not.</v>

3075
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.050
<v Speaker 4>But that's funny.</v>

3076
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.210
<v Speaker 4>But I think with driving that,</v>

3077
01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3078
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:10.590
<v Speaker 4>what I meant by reaction time is that you don't take precipitous action.</v>

3079
01:40:10.591 --> 01:40:11.950
<v Speaker 4>So the classic thing is that you're,</v>

3080
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:12.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm going somewhere,</v>

3081
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:13.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about something I,</v>

3082
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't turn where I wanted to turn,</v>

3083
01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.400
<v Speaker 4>but then I just like calm way,</v>

3084
01:40:18.401 --> 01:40:19.201
<v Speaker 4>find my way back.</v>

3085
01:40:19.201 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't like jerked the wheel.</v>

3086
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.010
<v Speaker 4>I do want to clarify though,</v>

3087
01:40:23.011 --> 01:40:23.970
<v Speaker 4>that that's you,</v>

3088
01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:24.391
<v Speaker 4>you're in a,</v>

3089
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 4>you're an intelligent guy and you have your shit together.</v>

3090
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.231
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3091
01:40:27.231 --> 01:40:27.600
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3092
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.190
<v Speaker 4>I think for most folks it's,</v>

3093
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:30.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3094
01:40:30.571 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't like driving Tai.</v>

3095
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3096
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be sober.</v>

3097
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be sober.</v>

3098
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>

3099
01:40:36.741 --> 01:40:38.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things that I don't like to do when I'm high.</v>

3100
01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:40.023
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind it,</v>

3101
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 4>but I want to get pulled over and I'm high and I got to talk my way out of,</v>

3102
01:40:43.050 --> 01:40:43.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3103
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 4>some cop being upset at me for being high,</v>

3104
01:40:45.601 --> 01:40:47.100
<v Speaker 4>like two of them telling me how to drive fine.</v>

3105
01:40:47.101 --> 01:40:47.934
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

3106
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be involved in that situation and I don't,</v>

3107
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm,</v>

3108
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I would be kind of a hypocrite if,</v>

3109
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.694
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3110
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.420
<v Speaker 1>if I said that and like,</v>

3111
01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:58.010
<v Speaker 1>or if I,</v>

3112
01:40:58.010 --> 01:41:00.400
<v Speaker 1>if I had a problem with some people getting high and driving,</v>

3113
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:02.130
<v Speaker 1>but I know some people were impaired.</v>

3114
01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:02.990
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3115
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.823
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3116
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that freak out and they get high.</v>

3117
01:41:06.281 --> 01:41:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Even driving when you were impaired.</v>

3118
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3119
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.220
<v Speaker 1>When you freaking out.</v>

3120
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I think even if it's only psychologically,</v>

3121
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 1>even if your reflexes are still there,</v>

3122
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you're still impaired,</v>

3123
01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3124
01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.793
<v Speaker 1>your</v>

3125
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:18.640
<v Speaker 1>don't drive like that.</v>

3126
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Please stop sobriety driving.</v>

3127
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:23.314
<v Speaker 1>I think go hand.</v>

3128
01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I did have you talked about being high and having to talk to a police officer.</v>

3129
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3130
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I was actually going to visit John Lilly and a chemist friend of mine had</v>

3131
01:41:32.531 --> 01:41:37.531
<v Speaker 3>separated the isomers of ketamine and I was going to bring that to John who</v>

3132
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:38.890
<v Speaker 3>hadn't tried the different isomers yet.</v>

3133
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3134
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 3>this is in Florida and it was way long time ago.</v>

3135
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:43.743
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3136
01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3137
01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3138
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I had a Porsche nine 14,</v>

3139
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:47.381
<v Speaker 3>which is small,</v>

3140
01:41:47.381 --> 01:41:47.801
<v Speaker 3>cheap car,</v>

3141
01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:48.880
<v Speaker 3>but just says the open top.</v>

3142
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 3>And so I was going from Sarasota,</v>

3143
01:41:51.161 --> 01:41:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Florida to Miami,</v>

3144
01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.290
<v Speaker 3>and it was just such a beautiful night and the moon was out and I was stone.</v>

3145
01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:56.771
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

3146
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:56.951
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3147
01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:57.784
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to speed.</v>

3148
01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just beautiful.</v>

3149
01:41:59.111 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get a ticket,</v>

3150
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:00.784
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay.</v>

3151
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:01.451
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

3152
01:42:01.451 --> 01:42:01.691
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3153
01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:03.370
<v Speaker 3>as long as I'm just going to get this ticket.</v>

3154
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:03.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3155
01:42:03.581 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 3>why don't I just think about what I could tell the police officer when the</v>

3156
01:42:08.411 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 3>inevitable happens.</v>

3157
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.950
<v Speaker 3>So you're thinking about this as you're planning for your ticket as and fire for</v>

3158
01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.331
<v Speaker 3>it tickets.</v>

3159
01:42:13.331 --> 01:42:13.521
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3160
01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:18.520
<v Speaker 3>what can I tell him about that would somehow or other the bok and I thought the</v>

3161
01:42:18.521 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 3>first thing is don't deny that I'm speeding.</v>

3162
01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3163
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

3164
01:42:21.730 --> 01:42:23.300
<v Speaker 3>don't contradict an I think,</v>

3165
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.750
<v Speaker 3>but the main thing I thought is what do we have in common?</v>

3166
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:27.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3167
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.880
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing I could think of is we're two guys out in the road.</v>

3168
01:42:30.881 --> 01:42:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't fry lonely guys on a Friday night out in the roads.</v>

3169
01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:37.210
<v Speaker 3>And so none of blow this car to get out and took it.</v>

3170
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'm very,</v>

3171
01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3172
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:45.650
<v Speaker 3>the story was that I was on my way to see my girlfriend and I was,</v>

3173
01:42:46.110 --> 01:42:46.943
<v Speaker 3>and that was late.</v>

3174
01:42:47.050 --> 01:42:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3175
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 3>And officer,</v>

3176
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I am speeding and I'm sorry,</v>

3177
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:52.420
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I was doing.</v>

3178
01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>And so it happened.</v>

3179
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I got pulled over,</v>

3180
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I told the story and the guy was like,</v>

3181
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3182
01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let you go.</v>

3183
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Just tell her that it's from me,</v>

3184
01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:05.290
<v Speaker 3>that you owe this for me.</v>

3185
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3186
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:09.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a nice car and get lucky and get a nice cop.</v>

3187
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3188
01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a many time.</v>

3189
01:43:10.690 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And then with John Lilly,</v>

3190
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:13.323
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3191
01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3192
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 3>one of the isomers is more active than the other.</v>

3193
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:20.920
<v Speaker 3>And so that was interesting,</v>

3194
01:43:20.921 --> 01:43:25.921
<v Speaker 3>but I also did get the sense that he was too much into the ketamine and too much</v>

3195
01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:27.790
<v Speaker 3>into this other state.</v>

3196
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

3197
01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I started trying to think about how possibly we could help him because he was</v>

3198
01:43:34.151 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 3>such a major contributor in a hero of mine.</v>

3199
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:41.140
<v Speaker 3>And one of the people that was a dolphin trainer that worked with him with some</v>

3200
01:43:41.141 --> 01:43:41.820
<v Speaker 3>of his dolphins,</v>

3201
01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:42.910
<v Speaker 3>had this sense,</v>

3202
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:43.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3203
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Roberta Goodman had this sense that,</v>

3204
01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3205
01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.040
<v Speaker 3>he was also going down hill.</v>

3206
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 3>And so we are,</v>

3207
01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>are arranged to get together</v>

3208
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.570
<v Speaker 4>with them to do MD may therapy.</v>

3209
01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:58.760
<v Speaker 4>And during that he kind of became very much into his body,</v>

3210
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.520
<v Speaker 4>but he had abscesses from where he was shooting himself.</v>

3211
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 4>He was in terrible shape.</v>

3212
01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 4>So he was shooting ketamine.</v>

3213
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.871
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3214
01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:06.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3215
01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3216
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.431
<v Speaker 4>In our Moscow.</v>

3217
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:07.671
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3218
01:44:07.671 --> 01:44:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Or did you do IB would do it ivy.</v>

3219
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes he would do it.</v>

3220
01:44:11.001 --> 01:44:11.960
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] he would get,</v>

3221
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:17.260
<v Speaker 4>he just was so trying to be out of body and another place that he wasn't taking</v>

3222
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:18.590
<v Speaker 4>care of himself.</v>

3223
01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3224
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:19.640
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>

3225
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:20.130
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3226
01:44:20.130 --> 01:44:22.050
<v Speaker 4>and it was painful to them.</v>

3227
01:44:22.051 --> 01:44:22.190
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3228
01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:26.930
<v Speaker 4>and so he kind of bounced into this awareness of what he was doing.</v>

3229
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.140
<v Speaker 4>So he had infections and infections.</v>

3230
01:44:29.150 --> 01:44:29.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3231
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:30.220
<v Speaker 4>He was her.</v>

3232
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.053
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3233
01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:31.521
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>

3234
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:32.354
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3235
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want to stay there and deal with it.</v>

3236
01:44:34.671 --> 01:44:36.120
<v Speaker 4>And so what we,</v>

3237
01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.790
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't help him,</v>

3238
01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.793
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3239
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:40.600
<v Speaker 4>because he didn't want it,</v>

3240
01:44:40.601 --> 01:44:41.880
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to deal with it.</v>

3241
01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Also is probably dealing with the reality of what the king body,</v>

3242
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 4>and he was an older man and he probably figured,</v>

3243
01:44:47.571 --> 01:44:48.051
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3244
01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:48.321
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3245
01:44:48.321 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 4>these states of mind,</v>

3246
01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:50.660
<v Speaker 4>I like this better.</v>

3247
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3248
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I'll just ride this bitch until the wheels fall off.</v>

3249
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3250
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that take that approach as well.</v>

3251
01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3252
01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And I'll end up to a guy who spent so much time in altered states of</v>

3253
01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:01.664
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

3254
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's unreasonable to like prefer that.</v>

3255
01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>

3256
01:45:08.151 --> 01:45:13.151
<v Speaker 4>I think it is because I think when you get this deeper sense about how</v>

3257
01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 4>life is so precious that that you can have these other states of mind,</v>

3258
01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:24.020
<v Speaker 4>but that it should be inculcating compassion,</v>

3259
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 4>a sense that you have to contribute to make it a better world.</v>

3260
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:32.060
<v Speaker 4>That this kind of self destructive isn't ultimately a few times,</v>

3261
01:45:32.061 --> 01:45:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3262
01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 4>there isn't,</v>

3263
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:33.381
<v Speaker 4>we live,</v>

3264
01:45:33.381 --> 01:45:33.920
<v Speaker 4>we die.</v>

3265
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3266
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:34.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3267
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 4>that this guy is feeling is Bobby giving out on him and he says,</v>

3268
01:45:38.811 --> 01:45:39.171
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3269
01:45:39.171 --> 01:45:42.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna Shoot Ketamine until the boat hits the rocks.</v>

3270
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3271
01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I think giving makes people happy.</v>

3272
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:47.900
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times people are depressed,</v>

3273
01:45:47.901 --> 01:45:48.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3274
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.270
<v Speaker 4>if they serve or help others.</v>

3275
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:51.260
<v Speaker 4>I even thought about that,</v>

3276
01:45:51.261 --> 01:45:52.100
<v Speaker 4>about the vet that,</v>

3277
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3278
01:45:52.851 --> 01:45:54.050
<v Speaker 4>if there was some way,</v>

3279
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:54.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3280
01:45:54.921 --> 01:45:58.100
<v Speaker 4>he felt that he was a harm to his family and that he was doing them good by</v>

3281
01:45:58.101 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 4>killing himself.</v>

3282
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.600
<v Speaker 4>And I think if only there would've been some soup kitchen or something that he</v>

3283
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:06.530
<v Speaker 4>could have felt that he was contributing,</v>

3284
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:08.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe that would have,</v>

3285
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:10.270
<v Speaker 4>and we kind of addressed that.</v>

3286
01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even know he was talking about the all the widows and created and that he</v>

3287
01:46:14.121 --> 01:46:16.550
<v Speaker 4>didn't feel like he had the the right to exist.</v>

3288
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3289
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 4>But that's psychological material to work through.</v>

3290
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:22.170
<v Speaker 4>That's not necessary.</v>

3291
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:26.240
<v Speaker 4>And I think even that's a hard thing to say.</v>

3292
01:46:26.241 --> 01:46:29.750
<v Speaker 4>But you're saying it from coming from someone who was an MDM experiences.</v>

3293
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think unless somebody has,</v>

3294
01:46:31.530 --> 01:46:32.363
<v Speaker 4>they really would,</v>

3295
01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:35.030
<v Speaker 4>would listen to this like a straight person.</v>

3296
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Not not mean knocked day,</v>

3297
01:46:36.531 --> 01:46:39.110
<v Speaker 4>but I mean a square car has never done any drugs.</v>

3298
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And Paul,</v>

3299
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I've really not been into drugs and I've took some percocets in college.</v>

3300
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.310
<v Speaker 4>If that person heard that,</v>

3301
01:46:46.311 --> 01:46:46.581
<v Speaker 4>there we go.</v>

3302
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:47.960
<v Speaker 4>What is this guy talking about?</v>

3303
01:46:47.961 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Like if the guy had post traumatic stress</v>

3304
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 7>disorder from murdering people and you know,</v>

3305
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 7>committing war crimes and he's openly spoke about it in this letter and then</v>

3306
01:46:57.390 --> 01:47:00.450
<v Speaker 7>you're telling them he's going to take ecstasy and he's going to,</v>

3307
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 7>he's going to be able to work through that.</v>

3308
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:03.560
<v Speaker 7>Like what of,</v>

3309
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:04.830
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3310
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:05.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3311
01:47:05.301 --> 01:47:06.410
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good point.</v>

3312
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.161
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3313
01:47:07.161 --> 01:47:08.450
<v Speaker 3>people have accused us of like,</v>

3314
01:47:08.451 --> 01:47:10.820
<v Speaker 3>you're going to try to help people just forget what they did.</v>

3315
01:47:10.821 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 3>And you can make mindless soldiers who will commit war crimes and then they get</v>

3316
01:47:14.931 --> 01:47:16.700
<v Speaker 3>a drug and they feel better and they go back.</v>

3317
01:47:16.701 --> 01:47:18.650
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's a really good point,</v>

3318
01:47:18.651 --> 01:47:18.990
<v Speaker 3>your race,</v>

3319
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:23.180
<v Speaker 3>because it's not that people say that was good,</v>

3320
01:47:23.181 --> 01:47:25.490
<v Speaker 3>that I can accept that that was good.</v>

3321
01:47:25.491 --> 01:47:28.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't reframe what they did into something good,</v>

3322
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:31.130
<v Speaker 3>but they realize that they,</v>

3323
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.810
<v Speaker 3>it's done.</v>

3324
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:34.370
<v Speaker 3>If they accept it,</v>

3325
01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:39.670
<v Speaker 3>it can give them the chance in the rest of their life to make up for it.</v>

3326
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Not that you can in any way,</v>

3327
01:47:41.991 --> 01:47:45.260
<v Speaker 3>but it gives you a way to go forward in a positive way.</v>

3328
01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if we do this in a marine's,</v>

3329
01:47:49.641 --> 01:47:50.474
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

3330
01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.600
<v Speaker 3>my guess is that it will make them more sensitive about those kind of occasions</v>

3331
01:47:57.950 --> 01:48:02.030
<v Speaker 3>where they might be reckless with their machine gun or something that it might</v>

3332
01:48:02.031 --> 01:48:03.920
<v Speaker 3>make them more careful.</v>

3333
01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3334
01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:05.241
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3335
01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:07.220
<v Speaker 3>These are like unknown questions and it's,</v>

3336
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.210
<v Speaker 3>it's really important.</v>

3337
01:48:08.211 --> 01:48:13.211
<v Speaker 3>But the process of dealing with post traumatic stress disorder is to more live</v>

3338
01:48:13.701 --> 01:48:14.534
<v Speaker 3>in the present,</v>

3339
01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:17.540
<v Speaker 3>to let the past inform you,</v>

3340
01:48:17.541 --> 01:48:18.980
<v Speaker 3>not to deny it and,</v>

3341
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:23.420
<v Speaker 3>but not to be so oppressed by it and to accept what you've done.</v>

3342
01:48:23.421 --> 01:48:27.230
<v Speaker 3>And I think once you accept that there is that evil and all of us that we have</v>

3343
01:48:27.231 --> 01:48:28.880
<v Speaker 3>to like those,</v>

3344
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:29.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3345
01:48:29.361 --> 01:48:33.920
<v Speaker 3>that we all have the capacity under certain circumstances to that,</v>

3346
01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.300
<v Speaker 3>that you can accept that.</v>

3347
01:48:35.690 --> 01:48:36.380
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3348
01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:37.213
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3349
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:42.310
<v Speaker 3>what we hope is that people then can move forward and recognize that they still</v>

3350
01:48:42.531 --> 01:48:46.010
<v Speaker 3>have some life and every day they can make choices and everyday they can try to</v>

3351
01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.530
<v Speaker 3>be helpful to somebody or we're not.</v>

3352
01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:50.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what we're talking about,</v>

3353
01:48:50.871 --> 01:48:51.321
<v Speaker 3>the healing.</v>

3354
01:48:51.321 --> 01:48:55.160
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make them look back and say that was okay what I did.</v>

3355
01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.560
<v Speaker 7>I think we are in a very strange period of,</v>

3356
01:49:00.561 --> 01:49:00.831
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

3357
01:49:00.831 --> 01:49:03.530
<v Speaker 7>of human history where we,</v>

3358
01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:05.930
<v Speaker 7>we know that we have all these issues.</v>

3359
01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.140
<v Speaker 7>We know we have massive government corruption.</v>

3360
01:49:09.141 --> 01:49:11.180
<v Speaker 7>We know we have massive financial corruption.</v>

3361
01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:15.770
<v Speaker 7>We know we have the great majority of people who don't agree with war acts that</v>

3362
01:49:15.771 --> 01:49:16.401
<v Speaker 7>are going on,</v>

3363
01:49:16.401 --> 01:49:18.410
<v Speaker 7>whether it's drone attacks or what have you.</v>

3364
01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.300
<v Speaker 7>And we wonder like,</v>

3365
01:49:20.301 --> 01:49:22.610
<v Speaker 7>why is our society so far behind?</v>

3366
01:49:22.611 --> 01:49:27.611
<v Speaker 7>Why have we achieved so such great technological and military heights,</v>

3367
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:32.210
<v Speaker 7>but yet socially were so fucked up.</v>

3368
01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.170
<v Speaker 7>And we have all the tools to fix that.</v>

3369
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:38.000
<v Speaker 7>And that's what's really insane.</v>

3370
01:49:38.001 --> 01:49:43.001
<v Speaker 7>It's like individuals have found with their own unique situations that through</v>

3371
01:49:43.341 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 7>yoga or through Mtma or through meditation or even some</v>

3372
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.080
<v Speaker 4>through religious chanting.</v>

3373
01:49:50.081 --> 01:49:50.271
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3374
01:49:50.271 --> 01:49:50.521
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3375
01:49:50.521 --> 01:49:51.000
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3376
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.241
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3377
01:49:51.241 --> 01:49:56.241
<v Speaker 4>and learning how control of your breath can change states of mine.</v>

3378
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.110
<v Speaker 4>People have gone that through jogging.</v>

3379
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about smoking pot and getting high.</v>

3380
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people who think things through when they're jogging and let</v>

3381
01:50:05.321 --> 01:50:07.060
<v Speaker 4>things go when they're jogging too.</v>

3382
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.520
<v Speaker 4>I think there's many,</v>

3383
01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:09.971
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

3384
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:14.971
<v Speaker 4>many pieces that we can use to try to fix this problem.</v>

3385
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:16.623
<v Speaker 4>And they all,</v>

3386
01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 4>they're all documented.</v>

3387
01:50:18.110 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Like we're not living in the dark ages anymore.</v>

3388
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3389
01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is one of the first generations it's been around.</v>

3390
01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:25.930
<v Speaker 4>It's experienced that that has that many tools.</v>

3391
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:29.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think you're right on when you talked about how we're overdeveloped</v>

3392
01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.000
<v Speaker 4>intellectually and underdeveloped emotionally and spiritually.</v>

3393
01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 4>It's not even that were underdeveloped.</v>

3394
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 4>It's just were not developed at all.</v>

3395
01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.161
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3396
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:43.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like most people were acting on momentum or imitating their atmosphere.</v>

3397
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3398
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:44.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3399
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 4>were developed some,</v>

3400
01:50:45.911 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 4>we think the primates are pure instincts.</v>

3401
01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:50.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3402
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3403
01:50:50.801 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 4>as a science society it's pretty crazy.</v>

3404
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:54.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3405
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 4>groups are,</v>

3406
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:55.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3407
01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:55.481
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3408
01:50:55.481 --> 01:50:56.380
<v Speaker 4>that's what I thought about,</v>

3409
01:50:57.130 --> 01:50:57.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3410
01:50:57.490 --> 01:50:58.091
<v Speaker 4>Hitler's Jeremy,</v>

3411
01:50:58.091 --> 01:50:58.241
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3412
01:50:58.241 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 4>that you've got a culture that's insane.</v>

3413
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.461
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

3414
01:51:00.461 --> 01:51:02.260
<v Speaker 4>we're rights North Korea right now.</v>

3415
01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 4>They're all programmed and yeah.</v>

3416
01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:08.380
<v Speaker 4>So that there's a way in which if you look at our technology,</v>

3417
01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:09.790
<v Speaker 4>which is miraculous,</v>

3418
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.793
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

3419
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.460
<v Speaker 4>and we have capacities now to alter the planet with global warming,</v>

3420
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:20.730
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have the emotional and spiritual development to cope with the</v>

3421
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 4>technological changes.</v>

3422
01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:26.050
<v Speaker 4>And in a way that's been really productive,</v>

3423
01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 4>this kind of separating out the intellect from religion and morals,</v>

3424
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3425
01:51:30.610 --> 01:51:34.890
<v Speaker 4>because religion and morals sort of squashed the intellect and didn't want a</v>

3426
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Copernicus and Galileo and just a whole history of things.</v>

3427
01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:42.480
<v Speaker 4>But is that really religious or is that just the people claiming to be religious</v>

3428
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:43.600
<v Speaker 4>human beings?</v>

3429
01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3430
01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:44.381
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3431
01:51:44.381 --> 01:51:48.520
<v Speaker 4>It's just the ideologies behind these ideas that didn't want to relinquish</v>

3432
01:51:48.521 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

3433
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:51:49.121 --> 01:51:54.121
<v Speaker 4>Because Albert Einstein talked about how a true science and true religion are</v>

3435
01:51:55.091 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 4>not in opposition,</v>

3436
01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 4>and that the scientist is also,</v>

3437
01:51:59.160 --> 01:51:59.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3438
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:02.380
<v Speaker 4>in a state of wonder and spiritual appreciation.</v>

3439
01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:02.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3440
01:52:02.861 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Because people that think that religion is ridiculous or that God is ridiculous,</v>

3441
01:52:06.731 --> 01:52:08.460
<v Speaker 4>or the concept of a higher powers with Dojo,</v>

3442
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

3443
01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.090
<v Speaker 4>you know what else is ridiculous?</v>

3444
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.860
<v Speaker 4>The whole universe itself,</v>

3445
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there's a floating ball quarter,</v>

3446
01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 4>the size of the earth called the moon,</v>

3447
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 4>just floating in space above us.</v>

3448
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:19.870
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

3449
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 4>How heavy is that stupid thing?</v>

3450
01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:22.810
<v Speaker 4>It's just floating above us.</v>

3451
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.021
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3452
01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:23.854
<v Speaker 4>and without it,</v>

3453
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 4>our world would not exist because our temperature would not be regulated enough</v>

3454
01:52:29.051 --> 01:52:31.420
<v Speaker 4>that we could live in cold climates and hot climates.</v>

3455
01:52:31.421 --> 01:52:33.490
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be predictable enough.</v>

3456
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:34.423
<v Speaker 4>We'd be fucked.</v>

3457
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:34.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3458
01:52:34.961 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3459
01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.011
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

3460
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:39.960
<v Speaker 4>That's way crazier than some guy who built everything through,</v>

3461
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:40.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3462
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.590
<v Speaker 4>big bang.</v>

3463
01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:44.590
<v Speaker 4>That's crazier than anything that religions ever come up with ever.</v>

3464
01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 4>That the whole universe was smaller</v>

3465
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.780
<v Speaker 7>than the head of a pin and then exploded 13 point whatever billion years ago and</v>

3466
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:52.940
<v Speaker 7>created the skies above and everything you said.</v>

3467
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:53.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3468
01:52:53.331 --> 01:52:53.841
<v Speaker 3>Well you said,</v>

3469
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:54.441
<v Speaker 3>is it futile?</v>

3470
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:55.430
<v Speaker 3>You live and you die.</v>

3471
01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:00.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think that those moments of wonder or appreciation for just how</v>

3472
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:01.521
<v Speaker 3>miraculous,</v>

3473
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:05.090
<v Speaker 3>mysterious and comprehensible or those moments of love,</v>

3474
01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 3>that there's a way in which they make life worth it.</v>

3475
01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>

3476
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.310
<v Speaker 7>And I think that there can be a,</v>

3477
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.820
<v Speaker 7>I wanna,</v>

3478
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.370
<v Speaker 7>I don't wanna use the word religion,</v>

3479
01:53:13.371 --> 01:53:15.740
<v Speaker 7>but their kin and then I'm like ideology.</v>

3480
01:53:15.741 --> 01:53:20.741
<v Speaker 7>But there could be a way of living the life with wonder and with sharing</v>

3481
01:53:22.281 --> 01:53:27.281
<v Speaker 7>knowledge and with just looking into what we have learned rock solid about the</v>

3482
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 7>very universe we live in and respecting that and worshiping that.</v>

3483
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:35.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean in a way,</v>

3484
01:53:35.421 --> 01:53:36.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3485
01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:40.040
<v Speaker 7>not like I'm not talking about like a deity but about like,</v>

3486
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:41.540
<v Speaker 7>like a great wonder,</v>

3487
01:53:41.541 --> 01:53:44.960
<v Speaker 7>like the great wonder that it really is and there's a benefit to that.</v>

3488
01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3489
01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 3>And taking that into the pain I think is being able to take the loving energies</v>

3490
01:53:50.331 --> 01:53:54.400
<v Speaker 3>into the places that need healing and that that's where,</v>

3491
01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:59.600
<v Speaker 3>so just having a spiritual meditating on top of a mountain top and trying to,</v>

3492
01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3493
01:54:00.110 --> 01:54:01.640
<v Speaker 3>get off the wheel of suffering and stuff.</v>

3494
01:54:01.641 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a very egotistical way actually.</v>

3495
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:10.480
<v Speaker 3>And having the sense that while we though some of us are privileged in all</v>

3496
01:54:10.791 --> 01:54:15.380
<v Speaker 3>different ways to really be healthy and be wonderful with that and in wonder</v>

3497
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 3>without being so threatened that there's a lot of people that aren't and that we</v>

3498
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:19.994
<v Speaker 3>have to</v>

3499
01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.880
<v Speaker 3>not only feel those moments,</v>

3500
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 3>but then try to somehow as Martin Luther King talked about the arc of history,</v>

3501
01:54:26.931 --> 01:54:31.460
<v Speaker 3>make some contribution of some way that helps it for others too.</v>

3502
01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:32.850
<v Speaker 7>You know what was also ironic,</v>

3503
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.580
<v Speaker 7>one of the weird things that's going on with society,</v>

3504
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:36.000
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3505
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.290
<v Speaker 7>is that as our technological capabilities increase,</v>

3506
01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:44.880
<v Speaker 7>we also fill our skies with light pollution and we can't see the stars.</v>

3507
01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 7>And one of the best psychedelic experiences I ever had outside of doing a drug</v>

3508
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:54.540
<v Speaker 7>was I went to the Keck observatory and y on the big island.</v>

3509
01:54:54.930 --> 01:54:58.200
<v Speaker 7>And we drove through the clouds and as we were driving,</v>

3510
01:54:58.230 --> 01:55:01.620
<v Speaker 7>like you wonder if it's going to be a cloudy day eggs and you won't be able to</v>

3511
01:55:01.621 --> 01:55:03.390
<v Speaker 7>see anything because it takes a while to get up there.</v>

3512
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:04.171
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

3513
01:55:04.171 --> 01:55:04.501
<v Speaker 7>Damn,</v>

3514
01:55:04.501 --> 01:55:05.520
<v Speaker 7>looks like it's cloudy.</v>

3515
01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:09.240
<v Speaker 7>But then we drove through the clouds and you realize,</v>

3516
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.421
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3517
01:55:09.421 --> 01:55:13.230
<v Speaker 7>this thing is so high up there that you actually drive past where the clouds</v>

3518
01:55:13.231 --> 01:55:13.411
<v Speaker 7>are.</v>

3519
01:55:13.411 --> 01:55:14.250
<v Speaker 7>This is nuts.</v>

3520
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 7>And we went up to the observatory and the view is just insane because the big</v>

3521
01:55:22.021 --> 01:55:24.030
<v Speaker 7>island is set up for the observatory,</v>

3522
01:55:24.031 --> 01:55:28.020
<v Speaker 7>so all the lights that they use for streetlights or a very special type of</v>

3523
01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:30.600
<v Speaker 7>diffused lighting that doesn't give light pollution off.</v>

3524
01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 7>So you have this incredible view of the stars where you see the whole Milky Way,</v>

3525
01:55:36.991 --> 01:55:37.950
<v Speaker 7>like a movie,</v>

3526
01:55:37.951 --> 01:55:38.400
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3527
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.640
<v Speaker 7>like those pictures of space and somehow or another,</v>

3528
01:55:41.641 --> 01:55:44.640
<v Speaker 7>it's just above us and you're looking at it,</v>

3529
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

3530
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:48.070
<v Speaker 7>it's so unbelievably humbling and,</v>

3531
01:55:48.071 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

3532
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:49.710
<v Speaker 7>and magical.</v>

3533
01:55:49.711 --> 01:55:50.041
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3534
01:55:50.041 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 7>I was staring into the impossible and I remember being upset that I couldn't see</v>

3535
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:57.480
<v Speaker 7>this every night that's up there all the time.</v>

3536
01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:57.691
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3537
01:55:57.691 --> 01:56:01.380
<v Speaker 7>and not seeing that and just making it this blank screen.</v>

3538
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.350
<v Speaker 7>By doing that you sort of like lose,</v>

3539
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:07.260
<v Speaker 7>you'll lose the feel for what's really going on.</v>

3540
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:07.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3541
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:08.880
<v Speaker 3>we're out of touch with that a lot.</v>

3542
01:56:08.881 --> 01:56:12.160
<v Speaker 3>I had this bonding moment with in some ways my opposite.</v>

3543
01:56:12.161 --> 01:56:16.260
<v Speaker 3>And my family and I were on a vacation in Israel and we decided to go across the</v>

3544
01:56:16.261 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Sinai desert by car to go see a Cairo and the pyramids.</v>

3545
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:25.200
<v Speaker 3>And we had to work with an Egyptian company and they had people had armed guards</v>

3546
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:26.730
<v Speaker 3>cause it's kind of dangerous now.</v>

3547
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:30.660
<v Speaker 3>And so as we were driving through the Sinai desert,</v>

3548
01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:31.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3549
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 3>and it was so dark and the sky was magnificent,</v>

3550
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 3>we asked if we could just stop the car and just sort of walk a bit from the</v>

3551
01:56:39.631 --> 01:56:39.841
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

3552
01:56:39.841 --> 01:56:40.470
<v Speaker 3>There was hardly any,</v>

3553
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 3>virtually no other traffic on the road.</v>

3554
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.811
<v Speaker 3>The only thing,</v>

3555
01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 3>we're military checkpoints every once in a while and we just went out.</v>

3556
01:56:46.111 --> 01:56:47.370
<v Speaker 3>And so these,</v>

3557
01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:48.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3558
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.020
<v Speaker 3>it was Ramadan too.</v>

3559
01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.560
<v Speaker 3>And so these Muslims who were with guns to protect us,</v>

3560
01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3561
01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:56.551
<v Speaker 3>who are Jewish,</v>

3562
01:56:56.551 --> 01:56:59.760
<v Speaker 3>we just stood under the stars in the middle of the desert with no light</v>

3563
01:56:59.761 --> 01:57:04.230
<v Speaker 3>pollution and just had this shared moment of kind of odd.</v>

3564
01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 3>The Majesty.</v>

3565
01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3566
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:07.163
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

3567
01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:07.910
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3568
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:12.310
<v Speaker 7>the view of the actual view that we're supposed to see,</v>

3569
01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.500
<v Speaker 7>I think is really what inspired people throughout history to,</v>

3570
01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:19.150
<v Speaker 7>to create the idea of gods and to create this,</v>

3571
01:57:19.530 --> 01:57:19.921
<v Speaker 7>I mean the,</v>

3572
01:57:19.921 --> 01:57:20.160
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3573
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.560
<v Speaker 7>the insane view that you get of that,</v>

3574
01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:27.250
<v Speaker 7>that just the images of those magical lights in the sky,</v>

3575
01:57:28.150 --> 01:57:29.860
<v Speaker 7>millions and billions of them.</v>

3576
01:57:29.861 --> 01:57:31.340
<v Speaker 7>Just to see that it's,</v>

3577
01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 7>it's so humbling and to not see that it's,</v>

3578
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.280
<v Speaker 7>it's so dead.</v>

3579
01:57:36.281 --> 01:57:37.300
<v Speaker 7>It's sold numb.</v>

3580
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:40.690
<v Speaker 7>Like we don't have an appreciation for the fact that we're in space.</v>

3581
01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.980
<v Speaker 7>You watch a documentary,</v>

3582
01:57:41.981 --> 01:57:43.240
<v Speaker 7>it seems kind of abstract,</v>

3583
01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:45.900
<v Speaker 7>but when you're on top of the observatory and you,</v>

3584
01:57:45.901 --> 01:57:49.300
<v Speaker 7>you look out and you have that incredible view of the stars,</v>

3585
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:50.140
<v Speaker 7>you go,</v>

3586
01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.340
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>

3587
01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:53.800
<v Speaker 7>Like we are really in space right now.</v>

3588
01:57:53.801 --> 01:57:58.801
<v Speaker 7>We are on a big organic spaceship and we're moving thousand miles an hour in a</v>

3589
01:57:59.651 --> 01:58:00.484
<v Speaker 7>circle.</v>

3590
01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:01.323
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3591
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:02.223
<v Speaker 7>It's nuts.</v>

3592
01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:02.830
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3593
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:04.120
<v Speaker 7>it's weird to see.</v>

3594
01:58:04.150 --> 01:58:04.310
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3595
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.861
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

3596
01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 3>what it's done to Stuart brand talked about a lot about the,</v>

3597
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 3>with the whole or is cloud the picture of the earth from space?</v>

3598
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3599
01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.380
<v Speaker 3>We're the first generation or two that's ever had that image.</v>

3600
01:58:15.590 --> 01:58:18.250
<v Speaker 7>And those astronauts that go up in the space station,</v>

3601
01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:19.093
<v Speaker 7>a spatial,</v>

3602
01:58:19.130 --> 01:58:21.530
<v Speaker 7>they all talk about the experience.</v>

3603
01:58:21.590 --> 01:58:23.120
<v Speaker 7>It's being very transcendent.</v>

3604
01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.290
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3605
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:28.910
<v Speaker 7>when you take that view of the earth from above and you look down,</v>

3606
01:58:28.911 --> 01:58:33.911
<v Speaker 7>you see just the nature of the whole reality of a planet in the solar system,</v>

3607
01:58:35.991 --> 01:58:37.070
<v Speaker 7>in a galaxy,</v>

3608
01:58:37.071 --> 01:58:37.910
<v Speaker 7>in a universe.</v>

3609
01:58:37.911 --> 01:58:38.570
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>

3610
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:40.250
<v Speaker 7>it all just sort of falls into place.</v>

3611
01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:40.610
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

3612
01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>

3613
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.580
<v Speaker 7>But when you're down here and you're stuck in traffic and the skies dark,</v>

3614
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 7>you don't even think about it,</v>

3615
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:47.590
<v Speaker 7>but you're,</v>

3616
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 7>you're on this majestic ride through the heavens.</v>

3617
01:58:50.351 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 7>Instead you're overwhelmed with a Moan,</v>

3618
01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 7>mundane bullshit of this person in front of you,</v>

3619
01:58:55.151 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 7>not reacting to the green light.</v>

3620
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:57.663
<v Speaker 7>Come on.</v>

3621
01:58:58.490 --> 01:59:00.260
<v Speaker 3>And if you can somehow do both,</v>

3622
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:01.010
<v Speaker 3>it's not that.</v>

3623
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3624
01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:03.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I think lily lily got wrong.</v>

3625
01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:03.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3626
01:59:03.631 --> 01:59:05.930
<v Speaker 3>you've got the spiritual part was the more important part.</v>

3627
01:59:05.931 --> 01:59:07.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's the balance.</v>

3628
01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:07.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3629
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:08.421
<v Speaker 3>my daughter,</v>

3630
01:59:08.421 --> 01:59:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Ellie is in eighth grade and she had to do a project with,</v>

3631
01:59:12.591 --> 01:59:13.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3632
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.100
<v Speaker 3>for national history day and with a couple of her girlfriends,</v>

3633
01:59:16.101 --> 01:59:17.720
<v Speaker 3>they did a project on Apollo 11,</v>

3634
01:59:17.721 --> 01:59:18.554
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

3635
01:59:18.650 --> 01:59:19.520
<v Speaker 3>and it turned out that,</v>

3636
01:59:19.730 --> 01:59:20.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3637
01:59:20.210 --> 01:59:21.410
<v Speaker 3>the girl that she did it with,</v>

3638
01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins was her grandfather.</v>

3639
01:59:23.721 --> 01:59:25.510
<v Speaker 3>He was the one that was on the,</v>

3640
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:27.530
<v Speaker 3>when Armstrong put his foot on the,</v>

3641
01:59:28.190 --> 01:59:31.790
<v Speaker 3>and I'm buzz Aldridge that he was the one that stayed in the capsule.</v>

3642
01:59:31.791 --> 01:59:35.630
<v Speaker 3>And so they actually got to interview him as part of this and he did talk about</v>

3643
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:40.910
<v Speaker 3>for him what was so amazing both being up there in space and seeing the earth,</v>

3644
01:59:40.911 --> 01:59:45.110
<v Speaker 3>but also when he got back and they went around the world and people were</v>

3645
01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:46.910
<v Speaker 3>cheering and talking about things,</v>

3646
01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:50.360
<v Speaker 3>he said that he thought that people would say,</v>

3647
01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3648
01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.730
<v Speaker 3>look what you Americans did.</v>

3649
01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.710
<v Speaker 3>And wherever we went,</v>

3650
01:59:54.711 --> 01:59:55.101
<v Speaker 3>people said,</v>

3651
01:59:55.101 --> 01:59:56.000
<v Speaker 3>look what we did.</v>

3652
01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Like it was the human race that we went to the moon and people wanted to be part</v>

3653
02:00:01.701 --> 02:00:02.534
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

3654
02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:03.680
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

3655
02:00:03.681 --> 02:00:05.750
<v Speaker 3>because it was such a space race with Russia,</v>

3656
02:00:05.751 --> 02:00:06.080
<v Speaker 3>he started,</v>

3657
02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:06.651
<v Speaker 3>we did it.</v>

3658
02:00:06.651 --> 02:00:07.484
<v Speaker 3>But he saw,</v>

3659
02:00:07.610 --> 02:00:07.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3660
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:08.870
<v Speaker 3>we're Americans did it,</v>

3661
02:00:08.871 --> 02:00:12.290
<v Speaker 3>but he saw around the world that people said we all collectively did it</v>

3662
02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:13.130
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3663
02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:16.230
<v Speaker 7>the idea of we all collectively are in this thing together,</v>

3664
02:00:16.231 --> 02:00:18.060
<v Speaker 7>that we are a global community.</v>

3665
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:22.680
<v Speaker 7>And that's really one of the last saving hopes of humanity.</v>

3666
02:00:22.890 --> 02:00:26.010
<v Speaker 7>And I think the Internet has sort of reinforced that idea in a way that never</v>

3667
02:00:26.011 --> 02:00:26.844
<v Speaker 7>existed.</v>

3668
02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:28.020
<v Speaker 7>I think nationalism,</v>

3669
02:00:28.021 --> 02:00:31.020
<v Speaker 7>the idea of nationalism seems so much more preposterous now,</v>

3670
02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.160
<v Speaker 7>especially nationalism and a war sense.</v>

3671
02:00:33.610 --> 02:00:34.443
<v Speaker 7>Nationalism,</v>

3672
02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.440
<v Speaker 7>it's nothing wrong with being proud of the town you live in.</v>

3673
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.630
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3674
02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:39.420
<v Speaker 7>nothing brought warm with a cheering for the,</v>

3675
02:00:39.421 --> 02:00:40.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3676
02:00:40.050 --> 02:00:41.490
<v Speaker 7>your home basketball team.</v>

3677
02:00:41.491 --> 02:00:42.870
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing wrong with any of that.</v>

3678
02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:46.050
<v Speaker 7>But what's wrong is when it translates into war.</v>

3679
02:00:46.051 --> 02:00:51.051
<v Speaker 7>And I think that this is the first culture that has really sort of openly</v>

3680
02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:54.750
<v Speaker 7>embraced a global society.</v>

3681
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.590
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3682
02:00:55.590 --> 02:00:57.120
<v Speaker 7>I think kids today,</v>

3683
02:00:57.150 --> 02:01:02.150
<v Speaker 7>they're far less likely to buy the bullshit when it comes to us against them or</v>

3684
02:01:02.821 --> 02:01:04.110
<v Speaker 7>any ideas about,</v>

3685
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:04.651
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3686
02:01:04.651 --> 02:01:06.930
<v Speaker 7>what's really going on with geopolitical struggles.</v>

3687
02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:07.933
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3688
02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.050
<v Speaker 7>We know the kids in Iran,</v>

3689
02:01:10.170 --> 02:01:11.003
<v Speaker 7>like they're just,</v>

3690
02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.500
<v Speaker 7>they're kids to try and get out of the,</v>

3691
02:01:13.710 --> 02:01:15.570
<v Speaker 7>under the thumb of an oppressive government.</v>

3692
02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:17.190
<v Speaker 3>What my son Eden,</v>

3693
02:01:17.191 --> 02:01:18.750
<v Speaker 3>who is just going to college,</v>

3694
02:01:18.751 --> 02:01:21.840
<v Speaker 3>he was playing a halo and you can play multip,</v>

3695
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:22.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3696
02:01:22.681 --> 02:01:24.960
<v Speaker 3>and he was playing with somebody in a Saudi Arabia.</v>

3697
02:01:26.090 --> 02:01:27.560
<v Speaker 3>It's so great.</v>

3698
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:28.800
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic.</v>

3699
02:01:28.801 --> 02:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we see a lot is the rise of fundamentalism.</v>

3700
02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:33.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3701
02:01:33.630 --> 02:01:35.250
<v Speaker 3>the Orthodox Jews are nuts.</v>

3702
02:01:35.251 --> 02:01:36.084
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3703
02:01:36.150 --> 02:01:38.220
<v Speaker 3>some of the Orthodox Christians and Muslims,</v>

3704
02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:39.083
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>

3705
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I think because of the forces of globalization,</v>

3706
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 3>because it's harder to sustain that we're the one,</v>

3707
02:01:45.951 --> 02:01:46.191
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3708
02:01:46.191 --> 02:01:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Religion,</v>

3709
02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:47.001
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3710
02:01:47.001 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of having to circle their wagons and they become a bit more</v>

3711
02:01:50.661 --> 02:01:51.494
<v Speaker 3>extreme.</v>

3712
02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And so it might look on the surface that things are getting worse.</v>

3713
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's this defensive mechanism where they can barely hold it</v>

3714
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:00.010
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3715
02:02:00.010 --> 02:02:04.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think it won't end up with homogenous one world religion,</v>

3716
02:02:04.311 --> 02:02:05.061
<v Speaker 3>one government.</v>

3717
02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:07.430
<v Speaker 3>We'll appreciate those small things about the,</v>

3718
02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:08.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3719
02:02:08.121 --> 02:02:09.020
<v Speaker 3>the local town,</v>

3720
02:02:09.110 --> 02:02:10.160
<v Speaker 3>where are you are,</v>

3721
02:02:10.161 --> 02:02:15.161
<v Speaker 3>you can appreciate the differences even more when you feel part of the</v>

3722
02:02:15.411 --> 02:02:16.131
<v Speaker 3>commonality.</v>

3723
02:02:16.131 --> 02:02:18.980
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be scared of the differences cause there's something deeper</v>

3724
02:02:18.981 --> 02:02:19.814
<v Speaker 3>that connects it.</v>

3725
02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.430
<v Speaker 7>I think there's also a problem that people have in the human beings.</v>

3726
02:02:24.431 --> 02:02:29.431
<v Speaker 7>We share chimpanzee Alpha male DNA and we are always looking for leaders.</v>

3727
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:31.660
<v Speaker 7>And Yeah,</v>

3728
02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:33.850
<v Speaker 7>the other problem is once someone becomes a leader,</v>

3729
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3730
02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.460
<v Speaker 7>we see there was with politicians and dictators,</v>

3731
02:02:36.461 --> 02:02:41.461
<v Speaker 7>we saw it with the people that that came in after Mubarak in Egypt tried to pass</v>

3732
02:02:42.551 --> 02:02:46.540
<v Speaker 7>all these crazy fucking laws that essentially made them dictators.</v>

3733
02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:48.220
<v Speaker 7>And then the people were like,</v>

3734
02:02:48.221 --> 02:02:49.690
<v Speaker 7>what are you talking about?</v>

3735
02:02:49.691 --> 02:02:50.350
<v Speaker 7>Like this is,</v>

3736
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:52.510
<v Speaker 7>this is what we just shed blood for.</v>

3737
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:57.870
<v Speaker 7>Like in you assholes are trying to make yourself immune to prosecution for all</v>

3738
02:02:57.911 --> 02:02:59.680
<v Speaker 7>these different things that you could be doing.</v>

3739
02:02:59.681 --> 02:03:00.550
<v Speaker 7>Like fuck you.</v>

3740
02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:00.941
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3741
02:03:00.941 --> 02:03:01.840
<v Speaker 7>you can't do that.</v>

3742
02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:05.410
<v Speaker 7>And I think seeing that for the first time,</v>

3743
02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:06.633
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3744
02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.630
<v Speaker 7>globally,</v>

3745
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.530
<v Speaker 7>even though right now it may be very frustrating for us and it is frustrating</v>

3746
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:14.410
<v Speaker 7>for us because we don't think change is coming quickly.</v>

3747
02:03:14.410 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 7>Enough change that the corresponds with what we know about the world.</v>

3748
02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:19.540
<v Speaker 7>I think it is.</v>

3749
02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.070
<v Speaker 7>If you look at it historically,</v>

3750
02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.080
<v Speaker 7>if they look back to this time,</v>

3751
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.620
<v Speaker 7>I think this will be a time of great turmoil and great change.</v>

3752
02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:29.260
<v Speaker 7>It's just that we measure history and he's 20,</v>

3753
02:03:29.261 --> 02:03:30.580
<v Speaker 7>30 year bursts.</v>

3754
02:03:31.090 --> 02:03:31.421
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3755
02:03:31.421 --> 02:03:35.080
<v Speaker 7>and I think the 20 year bursts that we're in right now is just bananas.</v>

3756
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:36.160
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3757
02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.010
<v Speaker 7>I think as I get older and as I watch my kids grow,</v>

3758
02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:40.060
<v Speaker 7>that for me,</v>

3759
02:03:40.630 --> 02:03:43.360
<v Speaker 7>10 or 20 years is no longer such a long time.</v>

3760
02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:43.871
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3761
02:03:43.871 --> 02:03:44.310
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>

3762
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:45.580
<v Speaker 7>And I think as you get older,</v>

3763
02:03:45.581 --> 02:03:47.020
<v Speaker 7>time speeds up to,</v>

3764
02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.800
<v Speaker 7>and so it's like those cops that were there so you can,</v>

3765
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:51.783
<v Speaker 7>so you can,</v>

3766
02:03:52.610 --> 02:03:53.980
<v Speaker 7>but we're not quite so scared.</v>

3767
02:03:53.981 --> 02:03:54.814
<v Speaker 7>Parts are late.</v>

3768
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:56.750
<v Speaker 7>And the um,</v>

3769
02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:57.600
<v Speaker 7>the side</v>

3770
02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.321
<v Speaker 3>of having a 20,</v>

3771
02:03:58.321 --> 02:04:02.760
<v Speaker 3>30 year plan or even to recognize as all the spiritual traditions talked about</v>

3772
02:04:02.761 --> 02:04:03.230
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

3773
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:03.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3774
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:07.350
<v Speaker 3>these great things are not accomplishable in one generation or buy one in one</v>

3775
02:04:07.351 --> 02:04:07.921
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>

3776
02:04:07.921 --> 02:04:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So that we just start the process are we not start it,</v>

3777
02:04:11.191 --> 02:04:15.090
<v Speaker 3>but we continue and then we try to pass it on to the next generation.</v>

3778
02:04:15.091 --> 02:04:16.740
<v Speaker 3>But I think that there is this,</v>

3779
02:04:17.490 --> 02:04:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3780
02:04:17.730 --> 02:04:22.730
<v Speaker 3>intensification and crisis and in that I think eventually the,</v>

3781
02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:23.993
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3782
02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3783
02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.100
<v Speaker 3>the fundamentalists,</v>

3784
02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:28.920
<v Speaker 3>we'll need to find more genuine spirituality,</v>

3785
02:04:29.010 --> 02:04:34.010
<v Speaker 3>not in this rigidity and hopefully they'll be able to coexist.</v>

3786
02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.760
<v Speaker 3>There was these demonstrations of millions of in Egypt,</v>

3787
02:04:37.761 --> 02:04:38.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3788
02:04:38.090 --> 02:04:38.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3789
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:40.080
<v Speaker 3>against the Muslim broaden brotherhood.</v>

3790
02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:44.010
<v Speaker 3>This is the first government in Israel that doesn't have the religious orthodox</v>

3791
02:04:44.011 --> 02:04:45.600
<v Speaker 3>as part of the governing body,</v>

3792
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.550
<v Speaker 3>which is a really healthy thing.</v>

3793
02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:48.360
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>

3794
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:48.981
<v Speaker 7>what does it who,</v>

3795
02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:53.600
<v Speaker 7>who made that quote history is a race between education and catastrophe.</v>

3796
02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:54.920
<v Speaker 7>Who's that?</v>

3797
02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.450
<v Speaker 7>Who is responsible for that quote?</v>

3798
02:04:56.451 --> 02:04:56.870
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3799
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:57.660
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3800
02:04:57.660 --> 02:04:58.493
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

3801
02:04:59.060 --> 02:04:59.893
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3802
02:05:00.190 --> 02:05:01.490
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember who it was.</v>

3803
02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.450
<v Speaker 7>Whoever it was.</v>

3804
02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:04.250
<v Speaker 7>They were bad motherfucker,</v>

3805
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:05.383
<v Speaker 7>whoever it was.</v>

3806
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:07.000
<v Speaker 7>But that's a,</v>

3807
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:08.780
<v Speaker 7>that's really what seems to be going on.</v>

3808
02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:10.330
<v Speaker 7>Was it hg wells?</v>

3809
02:05:10.330 --> 02:05:10.680
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3810
02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.320
<v Speaker 7>that was good.</v>

3811
02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.980
<v Speaker 7>That there really does seem to be,</v>

3812
02:05:12.981 --> 02:05:13.761
<v Speaker 7>well of course it's a,</v>

3813
02:05:13.761 --> 02:05:14.460
<v Speaker 7>she was,</v>

3814
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:15.293
<v Speaker 7>the guy was awesome.</v>

3815
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:16.490
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3816
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:18.680
<v Speaker 7>I think that that does seem to be what's going on.</v>

3817
02:05:18.681 --> 02:05:23.210
<v Speaker 7>It seems to be also that sometimes it almost feels like people need an</v>

3818
02:05:23.211 --> 02:05:25.970
<v Speaker 7>antagonist in order to perform at their very best.</v>

3819
02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:30.620
<v Speaker 7>It's almost like we need a rival to inspire us to reach great heights.</v>

3820
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:32.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3821
02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>And it depends on how you see them.</v>

3822
02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>If they're deeper down your ally,</v>

3823
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:37.420
<v Speaker 3>so that like,</v>

3824
02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>let's say in sports teams,</v>

3825
02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:39.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3826
02:05:39.761 --> 02:05:43.990
<v Speaker 3>you want your opponents to be as good as possible because that will call out the</v>

3827
02:05:43.991 --> 02:05:44.591
<v Speaker 3>best in you.</v>

3828
02:05:44.591 --> 02:05:49.591
<v Speaker 3>So at some level you want the worthy opponent that you don't have to totally</v>

3829
02:05:50.021 --> 02:05:50.854
<v Speaker 3>destroy.</v>

3830
02:05:51.190 --> 02:05:53.860
<v Speaker 3>You just are sort of coal valving together.</v>

3831
02:05:53.890 --> 02:05:56.740
<v Speaker 3>So I think we do need to test ourselves against,</v>

3832
02:05:57.250 --> 02:05:59.470
<v Speaker 3>against others and against our ourselves,</v>

3833
02:05:59.471 --> 02:06:04.390
<v Speaker 3>but we don't need to see the other side as the enemy to be destroyed.</v>

3834
02:06:04.630 --> 02:06:06.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

3835
02:06:06.011 --> 02:06:06.844
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3836
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I used to play this game,</v>

3837
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:09.303
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3838
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:13.000
<v Speaker 3>grew up in Chicago in Winnetka and Lake Michigan and some friends and I would go</v>

3839
02:06:13.001 --> 02:06:16.840
<v Speaker 3>in there and we'd play the greatest catch game and each of us guys,</v>

3840
02:06:16.841 --> 02:06:18.430
<v Speaker 3>we'd throw a football to somebody else.</v>

3841
02:06:18.431 --> 02:06:19.630
<v Speaker 3>It was like half in the water.</v>

3842
02:06:19.631 --> 02:06:19.981
<v Speaker 3>And our,</v>

3843
02:06:19.981 --> 02:06:24.070
<v Speaker 3>our goal as the thrower was to get it just barely where they could reach it,</v>

3844
02:06:24.670 --> 02:06:28.180
<v Speaker 3>where they had to make the spectacular dive and show off to everybody how great</v>

3845
02:06:28.181 --> 02:06:30.790
<v Speaker 3>they were and then they would have to do it back.</v>

3846
02:06:30.791 --> 02:06:32.590
<v Speaker 3>And so we are sort of helping.</v>

3847
02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:32.960
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

3848
02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.060
<v Speaker 3>we are like allies,</v>

3849
02:06:34.061 --> 02:06:35.470
<v Speaker 3>but we were pressing each other to,</v>

3850
02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.240
<v Speaker 3>to do spectacular things.</v>

3851
02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:38.930
<v Speaker 7>That's really interesting.</v>

3852
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:41.720
<v Speaker 7>Well that's one of the principles of a,</v>

3853
02:06:41.721 --> 02:06:46.520
<v Speaker 7>of Jujitsu and a martial arts is that you really only as good as your training</v>

3854
02:06:46.521 --> 02:06:47.090
<v Speaker 7>partners.</v>

3855
02:06:47.090 --> 02:06:47.790
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3856
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:49.280
<v Speaker 7>Have you trained with really good people,</v>

3857
02:06:49.281 --> 02:06:51.400
<v Speaker 7>you become really good and that's you.</v>

3858
02:06:51.401 --> 02:06:55.400
<v Speaker 7>You elevate to the level of the competition in the training room.</v>

3859
02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:00.760
<v Speaker 7>It's also the same a lot with a standup comedians were inspired by other really</v>

3860
02:07:00.891 --> 02:07:02.000
<v Speaker 7>funny standup comedians.</v>

3861
02:07:02.001 --> 02:07:05.920
<v Speaker 7>And when you find a particular group of group of talented people in a,</v>

3862
02:07:05.921 --> 02:07:07.310
<v Speaker 7>in a town or an area,</v>

3863
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:11.800
<v Speaker 7>oftentimes they'll develop a lot of very talented people around them who we</v>

3864
02:07:11.801 --> 02:07:15.890
<v Speaker 7>imitate the fact that you know that there's a high level of the art form and</v>

3865
02:07:15.891 --> 02:07:16.490
<v Speaker 7>that area.</v>

3866
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:17.211
<v Speaker 7>So like Austin,</v>

3867
02:07:17.211 --> 02:07:18.440
<v Speaker 7>Texas is a good example.</v>

3868
02:07:18.441 --> 02:07:21.710
<v Speaker 7>It's like there's always a lot of really good guys there and because there's</v>

3869
02:07:21.711 --> 02:07:23.180
<v Speaker 7>always a lot of really good guys there,</v>

3870
02:07:23.181 --> 02:07:24.500
<v Speaker 7>there's always a lot of really good guys.</v>

3871
02:07:24.501 --> 02:07:26.390
<v Speaker 7>There is a New York city's and other one,</v>

3872
02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:31.420
<v Speaker 7>but obviously this much more money involved in places like New York or La and</v>

3873
02:07:31.761 --> 02:07:32.594
<v Speaker 7>being good.</v>

3874
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:34.970
<v Speaker 7>So that becomes sort of a factor as,</v>

3875
02:07:35.230 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 7>but are you from</v>

3876
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:36.550
<v Speaker 4>us?</v>

3877
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Did you spend time in Austin?</v>

3878
02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:37.951
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3879
02:07:37.951 --> 02:07:40.800
<v Speaker 7>I just have a lot of friends there and I've done a lot of stand up there,</v>

3880
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:43.500
<v Speaker 7>but I just know the local scenes or he's really strong.</v>

3881
02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.200
<v Speaker 7>So there's a few places in the country as a comedian,</v>

3882
02:07:46.201 --> 02:07:46.790
<v Speaker 7>the scene,</v>

3883
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:48.270
<v Speaker 7>the local scenes are very strong.</v>

3884
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:49.330
<v Speaker 7>Denver,</v>

3885
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:51.330
<v Speaker 7>they always have a really strong local scene.</v>

3886
02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:54.510
<v Speaker 7>And that's another one that's pure because it's not really attached to Hollywood</v>

3887
02:07:54.511 --> 02:07:56.910
<v Speaker 7>and any way it's just pure standup comedy.</v>

3888
02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:59.760
<v Speaker 7>And then there's San Francisco,</v>

3889
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:00.660
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3890
02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:01.620
<v Speaker 7>Boston,</v>

3891
02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:02.371
<v Speaker 7>La,</v>

3892
02:08:02.371 --> 02:08:03.330
<v Speaker 7>New York,</v>

3893
02:08:03.690 --> 02:08:06.570
<v Speaker 7>little bit of Phoenix a little bit,</v>

3894
02:08:06.571 --> 02:08:06.811
<v Speaker 7>but it's,</v>

3895
02:08:06.811 --> 02:08:08.370
<v Speaker 7>it's a very limited thing.</v>

3896
02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:13.640
<v Speaker 7>And you can sometimes one or two great comedians will be in one area.</v>

3897
02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:15.300
<v Speaker 7>And then boom,</v>

3898
02:08:15.330 --> 02:08:16.170
<v Speaker 7>it'll blossom.</v>

3899
02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:16.861
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

3900
02:08:16.861 --> 02:08:17.694
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3901
02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:21.060
<v Speaker 7>Houston was Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks.</v>

3902
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:25.800
<v Speaker 7>They were all at this Houston comedy annex and because of them in this one</v>

3903
02:08:25.801 --> 02:08:26.640
<v Speaker 7>particular area,</v>

3904
02:08:26.670 --> 02:08:27.720
<v Speaker 7>it started to take off.</v>

3905
02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:28.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3906
02:08:28.051 --> 02:08:29.820
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of the idea of silicon valley.</v>

3907
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:30.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3908
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.891
<v Speaker 7>sure.</v>

3909
02:08:30.891 --> 02:08:34.370
<v Speaker 7>Get a bunch of brilliant people and you get inspired by other brilliant people.</v>

3910
02:08:34.371 --> 02:08:35.480
<v Speaker 7>They share ideas.</v>

3911
02:08:35.481 --> 02:08:35.861
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

3912
02:08:35.861 --> 02:08:36.081
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3913
02:08:36.081 --> 02:08:36.411
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3914
02:08:36.411 --> 02:08:37.400
<v Speaker 7>they pump each other up.</v>

3915
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:42.760
<v Speaker 7>And the idea that there's plenty for everybody and that working together can be</v>

3916
02:08:43.581 --> 02:08:45.530
<v Speaker 7>much more satisfying and you're,</v>

3917
02:08:45.531 --> 02:08:49.580
<v Speaker 7>you're much happier if your friends are doing well as much as you are.</v>

3918
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:50.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3919
02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3920
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.133
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3921
02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:53.311
<v Speaker 4>one of our,</v>

3922
02:08:53.311 --> 02:08:53.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3923
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3924
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Shawna haylight when,</v>

3925
02:08:54.751 --> 02:08:59.751
<v Speaker 4>if our board of directors who recently died was a brilliant computer guy and he</v>

3926
02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:02.190
<v Speaker 4>kept trying to say that,</v>

3927
02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:07.220
<v Speaker 4>that we should try to think from abundance rather than from constant need.</v>

3928
02:09:07.801 --> 02:09:08.140
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah.</v>

3929
02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:08.591
<v Speaker 7>Well that's a,</v>

3930
02:09:08.591 --> 02:09:09.101
<v Speaker 7>that's a,</v>

3931
02:09:09.101 --> 02:09:09.490
<v Speaker 7>just a,</v>

3932
02:09:09.490 --> 02:09:11.170
<v Speaker 7>a general principle of life.</v>

3933
02:09:11.171 --> 02:09:16.120
<v Speaker 7>Famine mentalities are terrible way of approaching life and that's the way a lot</v>

3934
02:09:16.121 --> 02:09:17.080
<v Speaker 7>of people approach life.</v>

3935
02:09:17.081 --> 02:09:20.620
<v Speaker 7>They approach life as if there's a finite amount of resources and they have to</v>

3936
02:09:20.621 --> 02:09:21.454
<v Speaker 7>get theirs.</v>

3937
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 7>And that's what leads to people cheating on their taxes.</v>

3938
02:09:24.161 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 7>That's a reason people lying,</v>

3939
02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:30.160
<v Speaker 7>trying to steal money and stealing money from their employers and shit along</v>

3940
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:30.940
<v Speaker 7>those lines.</v>

3941
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:31.890
<v Speaker 7>They're coming from,</v>

3942
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:32.570
<v Speaker 7>from a,</v>

3943
02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:34.300
<v Speaker 7>a standpoint of famine.</v>

3944
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:36.640
<v Speaker 7>Like there's stockpiling nuts for the winter,</v>

3945
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:37.241
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3946
02:09:37.241 --> 02:09:40.390
<v Speaker 4>They're not as comfortable about their ability to generate new resources.</v>

3947
02:09:41.230 --> 02:09:41.741
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>

3948
02:09:41.741 --> 02:09:43.300
<v Speaker 7>that's a terrible mentality.</v>

3949
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.090
<v Speaker 7>And that is a mentality and that,</v>

3950
02:09:46.091 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 7>that sort of,</v>

3951
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:51.550
<v Speaker 7>those sort of philosophies and those ideas can be reinforced or they can,</v>

3952
02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:53.590
<v Speaker 7>the opposite can be reinforced.</v>

3953
02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:54.450
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3954
02:09:54.450 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3955
02:09:54.610 --> 02:09:58.960
<v Speaker 7>generous bountiful mentality can be enforced as well.</v>

3956
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.141
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3957
02:09:59.141 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3958
02:09:59.200 --> 02:09:59.861
<v Speaker 4>Well for us,</v>

3959
02:09:59.861 --> 02:10:00.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3960
02:10:00.071 --> 02:10:03.790
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be 15 to $20 million to make Mtma into a medicine.</v>

3961
02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.870
<v Speaker 4>And the same for Psilocybin or LSD and we don't have all that money.</v>

3962
02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:08.733
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3963
02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 4>But it caused pharmaceutical companies way,</v>

3964
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:11.980
<v Speaker 4>way more than that.</v>

3965
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:16.720
<v Speaker 4>It should cost the amount that it costs to get one guy high on Mtma.</v>

3966
02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.370
<v Speaker 4>He should do it and go,</v>

3967
02:10:18.371 --> 02:10:18.640
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3968
02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.170
<v Speaker 4>listen to me and make it legal for us.</v>

3969
02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Just stop.</v>

3970
02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Stop the bullshit.</v>

3971
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3972
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:27.040
<v Speaker 4>But we've had to have that attitude that the resources are out there.</v>

3973
02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.820
<v Speaker 4>And once we can demonstrate that we can use them wisely as we grow,</v>

3974
02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 4>the resources will grow.</v>

3975
02:10:32.051 --> 02:10:32.884
<v Speaker 4>And so far,</v>

3976
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:33.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3977
02:10:33.321 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 4>we're in our 27th year and that's what's what's happening.</v>

3978
02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 4>How happy are you now that you're seeing all this like really tangible progress,</v>

3979
02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.260
<v Speaker 4>real tangible progress,</v>

3980
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:43.670
<v Speaker 4>very happy.</v>

3981
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.080
<v Speaker 4>But I'm also,</v>

3982
02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:45.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3983
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:50.360
<v Speaker 4>because I woke up to all this in 1971 and 72 right after the backlash.</v>

3984
02:10:50.890 --> 02:10:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3985
02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned a lot.</v>

3986
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:56.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to be very sensitive about another backlash today.</v>

3987
02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's possible.</v>

3988
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's impossible.</v>

3989
02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's likely right now.</v>

3990
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:02.661
<v Speaker 4>It just seems,</v>

3991
02:11:02.661 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 4>it seems like the information,</v>

3992
02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:05.390
<v Speaker 4>it's just too prevalent.</v>

3993
02:11:05.630 --> 02:11:05.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3994
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:08.870
<v Speaker 4>but how would you explain the fact that we can't even do marijuana research?</v>

3995
02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's a massive repression.</v>

3996
02:11:11.191 --> 02:11:13.220
<v Speaker 4>And so if all those people should be in jail,</v>

3997
02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 4>that's really what should happen.</v>

3998
02:11:15.411 --> 02:11:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Someone should realize what's going on and start locking people up.</v>

3999
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.800
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

4000
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.740
<v Speaker 4>let's play your game because what you're doing is ridiculous.</v>

4001
02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining people's lives for something that really should not be your</v>

4002
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:25.551
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>

4003
02:11:25.551 --> 02:11:29.000
<v Speaker 4>It should not be another person's choice whether or not they masturbate.</v>

4004
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.790
<v Speaker 4>And it should not be another person's choice whether or not they smoke pot.</v>

4005
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's really along the same lines.</v>

4006
02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:34.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4007
02:11:34.971 --> 02:11:37.400
<v Speaker 4>well I'm not so sympathetic with putting them in jail,</v>

4008
02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:40.100
<v Speaker 4>but I would like to take the source of their power,</v>

4009
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:45.250
<v Speaker 4>which is people's fear that they've generated and others and try to get more.</v>

4010
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:48.290
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm so glad to be talking with you in this,</v>

4011
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:49.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4012
02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:51.740
<v Speaker 4>podcasts to people to try to educate them to,</v>

4013
02:11:51.741 --> 02:11:55.790
<v Speaker 4>to realize that there is a way where we can work together and make things</v>

4014
02:11:55.791 --> 02:11:56.180
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

4015
02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:56.691
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

4016
02:11:56.691 --> 02:12:01.250
<v Speaker 4>But I think the people that have done things that have put people in jail for</v>

4017
02:12:01.251 --> 02:12:02.750
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines for,</v>

4018
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:07.030
<v Speaker 4>for selling pot or for growing pot or from owning pot there,</v>

4019
02:12:07.050 --> 02:12:08.030
<v Speaker 4>they're criminals.</v>

4020
02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Those are societal criminals.</v>

4021
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:10.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4022
02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I'd say that they have a bridge to other people's human rights without a doubt.</v>

4023
02:12:14.121 --> 02:12:17.270
<v Speaker 4>And they have done so with full cultural support.</v>

4024
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:22.300
<v Speaker 4>And I think the way to move forward is not to be so punitive for those that did</v>

4025
02:12:22.341 --> 02:12:22.431
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4026
02:12:22.431 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Although for some,</v>

4027
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:24.194
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4028
02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:24.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4029
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:25.091
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4030
02:12:25.091 --> 02:12:29.660
<v Speaker 4>but to talk about evolution and to talk about how a different approach is</v>

4031
02:12:29.661 --> 02:12:30.321
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>

4032
02:12:30.321 --> 02:12:31.101
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4033
02:12:31.101 --> 02:12:32.870
<v Speaker 4>whenever I'm in Alaska,</v>

4034
02:12:32.871 --> 02:12:36.350
<v Speaker 4>when there was a medical marijuana legalization bill one of the first years ago,</v>

4035
02:12:36.351 --> 02:12:41.351
<v Speaker 4>there was this whole idea of reparations to pay people that were in jail and the</v>

4036
02:12:42.051 --> 02:12:43.730
<v Speaker 4>polling that was done by the politic,</v>

4037
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 4>by the people trying to pass this initiative.</v>

4038
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4039
02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 4>it showed that that was a really weak part.</v>

4040
02:12:48.321 --> 02:12:52.510
<v Speaker 4>So where you try to impose these penalties on people for past behavior that at</v>

4041
02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.740
<v Speaker 4>time was sort of socially sanctioned.</v>

4042
02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:57.090
<v Speaker 4>What I meant by that was the,</v>

4043
02:12:57.091 --> 02:13:02.091
<v Speaker 4>the people that are actively working like privatized prison unions and things</v>

4044
02:13:02.271 --> 02:13:03.104
<v Speaker 4>along those lines,</v>

4045
02:13:03.110 --> 02:13:08.030
<v Speaker 4>working to keep these drugs illegal so that they profit and that's creepy.</v>

4046
02:13:08.210 --> 02:13:08.670
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

4047
02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:08.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4048
02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:13.010
<v Speaker 4>there's some real reprehensible shit that's going on.</v>

4049
02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.040
<v Speaker 4>It's not as simple as they're acting within culturally defined rules and</v>

4050
02:13:18.231 --> 02:13:19.064
<v Speaker 4>regulations.</v>

4051
02:13:19.210 --> 02:13:23.170
<v Speaker 4>There's some behind the scenes shady shit that's based on deception.</v>

4052
02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Well that the stuff like that is should be illegal,</v>

4053
02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:26.510
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4054
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:31.510
<v Speaker 4>But I think that the corporate capitalistic approach that we have does permit</v>

4055
02:13:31.861 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

4056
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.670
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff.</v>

4057
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And it permits lobbying congress and it permits this,</v>

4058
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.140
<v Speaker 3>this process where people try to get their own interests advanced sometimes over</v>

4059
02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 3>the interests of others.</v>

4060
02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:42.930
<v Speaker 3>And isn't it fascinating that,</v>

4061
02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you feel like this,</v>

4062
02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:50.541
<v Speaker 3>but that the thing that would fix the woes that society has more than anything</v>

4063
02:13:52.231 --> 02:13:55.560
<v Speaker 3>is a thing that these people were trying to keep from becoming legal.</v>

4064
02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:55.881
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4065
02:13:55.881 --> 02:13:57.360
<v Speaker 3>that might be the big race.</v>

4066
02:13:57.390 --> 02:14:02.340
<v Speaker 3>The big race might be recognizing that there are some fantastic tools to change</v>

4067
02:14:02.341 --> 02:14:03.870
<v Speaker 3>the consciousness of this culture.</v>

4068
02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4069
02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think that idea of thinking about them as tools is really the crucial</v>

4070
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:12.450
<v Speaker 3>distinction because they're not good or bad in and of themselves.</v>

4071
02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:13.920
<v Speaker 3>It's how they're used.</v>

4072
02:14:13.921 --> 02:14:15.810
<v Speaker 3>And our whole drug policy is,</v>

4073
02:14:15.811 --> 02:14:16.261
<v Speaker 3>there's good,</v>

4074
02:14:16.261 --> 02:14:17.094
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>

4075
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:18.360
<v Speaker 3>good drugs and bad drugs,</v>

4076
02:14:18.361 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 3>bad drugs are illegal and good drugs and get a burger king.</v>

4077
02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4078
02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Or from the pharmaceutical company.</v>

4079
02:14:24.690 --> 02:14:29.690
<v Speaker 3>But it's all about good and bad when it's actually how you use it.</v>

4080
02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:34.971
<v Speaker 3>And even the drug that was demonized the most in a way in the 50s in the 60s was</v>

4081
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:35.640
<v Speaker 3>thalidomide.</v>

4082
02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:40.110
<v Speaker 3>The drug that was the medical drug that caused birth defects in babies.</v>

4083
02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:44.640
<v Speaker 3>And the FDA stopped that in the u s but it was prevalent throughout Europe.</v>

4084
02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:50.120
<v Speaker 3>And now thalidomide has become a Madison and the same kind of shrinking of blood</v>

4085
02:14:50.221 --> 02:14:51.031
<v Speaker 3>vessels and things.</v>

4086
02:14:51.031 --> 02:14:54.870
<v Speaker 3>It's used in leprosy and it's used in cancer treatment.</v>

4087
02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.370
<v Speaker 3>So a drug that was among the most demonized of all has now been approved by the</v>

4088
02:14:59.371 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 3>FDA with certain kinds of safety procedures to make sure pregnant women don't</v>

4089
02:15:02.551 --> 02:15:03.384
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>

4090
02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 3>But it's the idea that these are tools and we have the ability to approach these</v>

4091
02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:13.131
<v Speaker 3>tools in an intelligent way and a respectful way or in a reckless way.</v>

4092
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:18.200
<v Speaker 3>And what we want to do is try to change these value judgments and prohibition,</v>

4093
02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:23.370
<v Speaker 3>support people's human rights to explore their own consciousness.</v>

4094
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4095
02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:28.560
<v Speaker 3>they have freedom of thought and to find a way to integrate into a society</v>

4096
02:15:28.561 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 3>that's moving forward.</v>

4097
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:31.200
<v Speaker 3>How do you do that?</v>

4098
02:15:31.230 --> 02:15:34.050
<v Speaker 3>By getting through the corruption because that's the only thing that's holding</v>

4099
02:15:34.051 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 3>it back.</v>

4100
02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Really the only thing holding it back is corruption at this point with the</v>

4101
02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 3>amount of data that's been accumulated on medical marijuana.</v>

4102
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4103
02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:42.250
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4104
02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:43.083
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

4105
02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:45.690
<v Speaker 3>the amount of data that's been accumulated,</v>

4106
02:15:45.691 --> 02:15:45.781
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4107
02:15:45.781 --> 02:15:47.610
<v Speaker 3>the government has been effective.</v>

4108
02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:48.340
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4109
02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:52.500
<v Speaker 3>the DEA parts of the government Niva in preventing what's called the phase three</v>

4110
02:15:52.501 --> 02:15:53.334
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>

4111
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:56.880
<v Speaker 3>the large scale definitive studies that by law congress has created,</v>

4112
02:15:56.881 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 3>FDA must have to prove safety and efficacy.</v>

4113
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:04.191
<v Speaker 3>So at this moment there is not enough data of the kind that the FDA uses for any</v>

4114
02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:05.100
<v Speaker 3>other drug.</v>

4115
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 3>And if we accept the idea that the FDA should regulate marijuana and</v>

4116
02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:09.841
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics,</v>

4117
02:16:09.841 --> 02:16:11.100
<v Speaker 3>like they do any other drug,</v>

4118
02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 3>then we have to acknowledge that there's not enough research for the FDA to</v>

4119
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:16.410
<v Speaker 3>approve it.</v>

4120
02:16:16.410 --> 02:16:20.850
<v Speaker 3>It's people twist it and say the FDA has rejected marijuana as a medicine,</v>

4121
02:16:20.851 --> 02:16:21.684
<v Speaker 3>which they have not.</v>

4122
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:25.960
<v Speaker 3>We just don't have enough research that way and they won't allow you to do phase</v>

4123
02:16:25.961 --> 02:16:26.794
<v Speaker 3>through research.</v>

4124
02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.980
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why the states,</v>

4125
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.080
<v Speaker 3>I think have enough evidence to make it legal and patients and doctors have</v>

4126
02:16:34.781 --> 02:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>enough evidence to decide to try it.</v>

4127
02:16:36.850 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just that in our system that we've created to try to make it so that</v>

4128
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:44.020
<v Speaker 3>through science we don't just see what we want to see,</v>

4129
02:16:44.021 --> 02:16:46.870
<v Speaker 3>but we kind of have a closer view of what's there.</v>

4130
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.580
<v Speaker 3>There are these procedures that still need to be undertaken for marijuana and</v>

4131
02:16:51.581 --> 02:16:52.690
<v Speaker 3>also from an May.</v>

4132
02:16:52.691 --> 02:16:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I say we're probably 10 years away from making Mtma into a</v>

4133
02:16:56.221 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>medicine and I think we'd be five,</v>

4134
02:16:58.181 --> 02:17:02.170
<v Speaker 3>six years away from making marijuana into an FDA approved medicine if the</v>

4135
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:03.790
<v Speaker 3>repression would be lifted right today.</v>

4136
02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:04.361
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

4137
02:17:04.361 --> 02:17:05.260
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>

4138
02:17:05.370 --> 02:17:09.970
<v Speaker 3>what is the difference between the stage that the FDA FDA requires and the data</v>

4139
02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:11.140
<v Speaker 3>that has been accumulated?</v>

4140
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Well for,</v>

4141
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:14.440
<v Speaker 3>there's the preclinical stage,</v>

4142
02:17:14.590 --> 02:17:17.740
<v Speaker 3>so what that means is preclinical clinical means humans.</v>

4143
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:22.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's a whole series of animal studies looking at toxicity that are</v>

4144
02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:26.200
<v Speaker 3>required by the FDA before you can get a drug into humans.</v>

4145
02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Once you've done that,</v>

4146
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:29.740
<v Speaker 3>then there's phase one,</v>

4147
02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:30.101
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

4148
02:17:30.101 --> 02:17:35.101
<v Speaker 3>three and four and phase one is working with people who are not patients who are</v>

4149
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 3>healthy volunteers to try to categorize what the drug does and what it does at</v>

4150
02:17:41.171 --> 02:17:42.010
<v Speaker 3>different doses.</v>

4151
02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:46.180
<v Speaker 3>And for certain drugs that are especially toxic like cancer drugs,</v>

4152
02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:48.880
<v Speaker 3>they have like phase one,</v>

4153
02:17:48.881 --> 02:17:53.881
<v Speaker 3>a phase two where it's a combination where the drug is so dangerous that it only</v>

4154
02:17:54.311 --> 02:17:55.960
<v Speaker 3>can be used in patients.</v>

4155
02:17:56.290 --> 02:17:58.630
<v Speaker 3>And so you do these dose finding studies,</v>

4156
02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:01.840
<v Speaker 3>looking at the side effects and it in general,</v>

4157
02:18:01.841 --> 02:18:02.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what phase one is.</v>

4158
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Phase two is where you start working with patients and you start seeing what</v>

4159
02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:08.050
<v Speaker 3>does it do?</v>

4160
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:09.130
<v Speaker 3>What is it good for?</v>

4161
02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:10.720
<v Speaker 3>How good is it?</v>

4162
02:18:10.721 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 3>What are your measures?</v>

4163
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 3>How well did your measures work?</v>

4164
02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.930
<v Speaker 3>How do you do the double blind to make sure you're not seeing what you want to</v>

4165
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:17.440
<v Speaker 3>see?</v>

4166
02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.200
<v Speaker 3>What is your scientific methodology for the studies?</v>

4167
02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4168
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:22.120
<v Speaker 3>what is your treatment approach?</v>

4169
02:18:22.121 --> 02:18:23.290
<v Speaker 3>What dose are you using?</v>

4170
02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:24.031
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4171
02:18:24.031 --> 02:18:25.150
<v Speaker 3>that's for phase two.</v>

4172
02:18:25.151 --> 02:18:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And that can take years and years and years.</v>

4173
02:18:27.311 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've been phase to,</v>

4174
02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:29.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4175
02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:31.270
<v Speaker 3>for Mtma for,</v>

4176
02:18:31.290 --> 02:18:32.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4177
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:34.660
<v Speaker 3>about nine years so far.</v>

4178
02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:35.883
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4179
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4180
02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Starting in 2004 is when we got the first permit.</v>

4181
02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:45.060
<v Speaker 3>We actually had permission in 2000 from 2000 and 2001 in Spain for Mtma for</v>

4182
02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:46.180
<v Speaker 3>PTSD.</v>

4183
02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:50.650
<v Speaker 3>And we had some media attention that was very positive on the radio and the main</v>

4184
02:18:51.010 --> 02:18:55.510
<v Speaker 3>TV and newspapers and radio and it motivated the anti-drug authority,</v>

4185
02:18:55.511 --> 02:18:57.490
<v Speaker 3>the forces of oppression to shut the study down.</v>

4186
02:18:57.490 --> 02:19:01.150
<v Speaker 3>And we weren't powerful enough to overcome it in Spain.</v>

4187
02:19:01.151 --> 02:19:05.190
<v Speaker 3>And that's where it was first started though with a study that,</v>

4188
02:19:05.290 --> 02:19:08.890
<v Speaker 3>that we were working with women survivors of rape with.</v>

4189
02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:09.581
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4190
02:19:09.581 --> 02:19:10.720
<v Speaker 3>But then you've got phase two.</v>

4191
02:19:10.721 --> 02:19:15.100
<v Speaker 3>So then once you have figured out your designs and the magnitude and the</v>

4192
02:19:15.101 --> 02:19:16.240
<v Speaker 3>variance of the effect,</v>

4193
02:19:16.241 --> 02:19:19.720
<v Speaker 3>how strong is it and how common is it?</v>

4194
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Is there a large number of people that don't respond at all or do most people</v>

4195
02:19:23.351 --> 02:19:26.560
<v Speaker 3>respond then you can size your phase three studies?</v>

4196
02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>So with marijuana,</v>

4197
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:33.310
<v Speaker 3>we have enormous amount of information up to the phase two level and the FDA</v>

4198
02:19:34.521 --> 02:19:39.521
<v Speaker 3>will have more information about marijuana Mtma LSD than about any other drug</v>

4199
02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 3>that they've ever approved in their entire history.</v>

4200
02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.440
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is because they,</v>

4201
02:19:45.650 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 3>the research is usually done with hundreds or thousands of people.</v>

4202
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 3>10,000 is about as high as you go.</v>

4203
02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 3>But we've had LSD used by tens of millions of people and marijuana by hundreds</v>

4204
02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 3>of millions of people.</v>

4205
02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.380
<v Speaker 3>And we know the one,</v>

4206
02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 3>one in a million side effects or the one in 5 million side effect that we only</v>

4207
02:20:02.481 --> 02:20:05.240
<v Speaker 3>discover from pharmaceutical drugs once they're approved.</v>

4208
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:09.230
<v Speaker 3>So it would not take a long time.</v>

4209
02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 3>We already know that we would work with marijuana,</v>

4210
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:13.610
<v Speaker 3>with a nausea control for cancer,</v>

4211
02:20:13.611 --> 02:20:14.480
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy,</v>

4212
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:15.770
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for pain,</v>

4213
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:20.210
<v Speaker 3>particularly for people on opiates because we've already shown in phase two</v>

4214
02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:24.590
<v Speaker 3>studies funded by the state of California that when you combine marijuana with,</v>

4215
02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:25.221
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4216
02:20:25.221 --> 02:20:25.791
<v Speaker 3>opiates,</v>

4217
02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:28.850
<v Speaker 3>that people get better pain control and they don't need as much of the opiates</v>

4218
02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.290
<v Speaker 3>and because of Oxycontin and all these big concerns.</v>

4219
02:20:32.291 --> 02:20:37.291
<v Speaker 3>So we know the areas that we would study with marijuana and we know the safety</v>

4220
02:20:37.791 --> 02:20:38.624
<v Speaker 3>profile.</v>

4221
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:43.630
<v Speaker 3>So we mainly need to just do studies and 200 5,500 people to look at the</v>

4222
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:46.880
<v Speaker 3>particular patient groups that we want to approve.</v>

4223
02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:51.830
<v Speaker 3>We have to get high quality standardized medical grade marijuana to do it in.</v>

4224
02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4225
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe we're five years away if the political barriers were removed right</v>

4226
02:20:56.151 --> 02:20:56.361
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

4227
02:20:56.361 --> 02:20:57.230
<v Speaker 3>which they're not.</v>

4228
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:58.160
<v Speaker 3>What happens</v>

4229
02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:03.800
<v Speaker 7>to someone that takes LSD and goes crazy because I've had many people tell me</v>

4230
02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:06.271
<v Speaker 7>stories.</v>

4231
02:21:06.271 --> 02:21:11.271
<v Speaker 7>I know the Syd Barrett story from a pink Floyd is a famous one.</v>

4232
02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:12.840
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's true,</v>

4233
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:17.160
<v Speaker 7>but that was the word was that he had taken too much acid and lost his mind.</v>

4234
02:21:17.650 --> 02:21:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible,</v>

4235
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:23.170
<v Speaker 3>but it depends on the supporters context.</v>

4236
02:21:23.350 --> 02:21:27.210
<v Speaker 3>And before you ask them about the candy flipping about MDA,</v>

4237
02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.053
<v Speaker 3>Lsd,</v>

4238
02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:33.300
<v Speaker 3>so in in the future when people are having this very difficult LSD experience,</v>

4239
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:37.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe they go to the emergency room or something.</v>

4240
02:21:38.290 --> 02:21:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Adding Mtma takes it from this terrifying sense of dying.</v>

4241
02:21:42.821 --> 02:21:46.510
<v Speaker 3>You go destruction and grounds it so that people can work through it.</v>

4242
02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:51.690
<v Speaker 3>So I think that LSD has that potential to destabilize people but in a supportive</v>

4243
02:21:52.751 --> 02:21:57.751
<v Speaker 3>environment that can be helpful and handled in support it.</v>

4244
02:21:58.271 --> 02:21:59.230
<v Speaker 3>So that's fascinating.</v>

4245
02:21:59.670 --> 02:22:03.510
<v Speaker 7>The candy flipping aspect over the adding end VMA might mitigate some of the</v>

4246
02:22:03.511 --> 02:22:06.650
<v Speaker 7>negative effects of the stress that you could get from the,</v>

4247
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:07.833
<v Speaker 7>the acid experience.</v>

4248
02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4249
02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:09.083
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>

4250
02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4251
02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:11.460
<v Speaker 3>And then you can,</v>

4252
02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:13.020
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

4253
02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:14.320
<v Speaker 3>one possible,</v>

4254
02:22:14.321 --> 02:22:15.154
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4255
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:20.310
<v Speaker 3>thing we would like to study one day would be to take people who are dying and</v>

4256
02:22:20.430 --> 02:22:22.230
<v Speaker 3>start them like we did in Switzerland.</v>

4257
02:22:22.231 --> 02:22:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Start them with LSD and four later administer MTMA.</v>

4258
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:29.400
<v Speaker 3>So that way LSD peaks in around three and a half hours,</v>

4259
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:29.581
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

4260
02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:30.361
<v Speaker 3>three and a half hours.</v>

4261
02:22:30.361 --> 02:22:35.361
<v Speaker 3>So they go through the whole challenging Lsd of letting go of opening up and</v>

4262
02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:37.110
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4263
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4264
02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:38.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4265
02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:39.420
<v Speaker 3>hopefully they can make it through that.</v>

4266
02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:44.340
<v Speaker 3>And then at the four hours you give Mtma and then everything softens and they</v>

4267
02:22:44.341 --> 02:22:45.810
<v Speaker 3>can take it in more.</v>

4268
02:22:45.811 --> 02:22:48.150
<v Speaker 3>And then they integrate as they're coming down.</v>

4269
02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4270
02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:52.170
<v Speaker 3>so you ride one wave run to the next year,</v>

4271
02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:53.400
<v Speaker 3>or if they're flipping out,</v>

4272
02:22:53.401 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>if it's too painful or too difficult for them,</v>

4273
02:22:55.891 --> 02:23:00.891
<v Speaker 3>maybe at the one at the two hours you could administer it Mtma there and you</v>

4274
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:03.090
<v Speaker 3>don't even have to minister full dose of MD May.</v>

4275
02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a half dose of Md Mace softens it somewhat because they have a</v>

4276
02:23:06.601 --> 02:23:07.620
<v Speaker 3>synergistic effect.</v>

4277
02:23:07.710 --> 02:23:07.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4278
02:23:07.951 --> 02:23:08.610
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

4279
02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:09.443
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

4280
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:11.220
<v Speaker 3>They go the two of them together.</v>

4281
02:23:11.221 --> 02:23:12.240
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between,</v>

4282
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:13.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4283
02:23:13.170 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 3>it's more like,</v>

4284
02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:15.024
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4285
02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:16.060
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

4286
02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>there's an expansion aspect to it,</v>

4287
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:20.640
<v Speaker 3>but there's a grounding aspect as well.</v>

4288
02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:23.610
<v Speaker 3>So you think that's a really good combination then?</v>

4289
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 3>That's how I,</v>

4290
02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:25.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

4291
02:23:25.411 --> 02:23:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4292
02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

4293
02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:27.391
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

4294
02:23:27.391 --> 02:23:28.224
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4295
02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:29.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4296
02:23:29.731 --> 02:23:31.530
<v Speaker 3>sometimes for spiritual purposes,</v>

4297
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:32.300
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

4298
02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:32.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4299
02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:35.030
<v Speaker 3>where people are looking for this ego dissolution,</v>

4300
02:23:35.490 --> 02:23:36.323
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4301
02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:36.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4302
02:23:36.781 --> 02:23:37.680
<v Speaker 3>you start with Lsd,</v>

4303
02:23:37.681 --> 02:23:39.090
<v Speaker 3>you start with Psilocybin,</v>

4304
02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:40.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4305
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:42.690
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the experiences last day,</v>

4306
02:23:42.691 --> 02:23:43.050
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

4307
02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:44.220
<v Speaker 3>10 hours or more.</v>

4308
02:23:44.221 --> 02:23:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes if you don't fully,</v>

4309
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 3>if you open up to the energy flowing through you,</v>

4310
02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:52.530
<v Speaker 3>then the psychedelic experience tends to take a shorter amount of time.</v>

4311
02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And if you end into this resistance,</v>

4312
02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:58.170
<v Speaker 3>because for whatever reasons it's really difficult.</v>

4313
02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:03.360
<v Speaker 3>It prolongs the experience and once you enter into those kinds of places,</v>

4314
02:24:03.361 --> 02:24:05.070
<v Speaker 3>if you were to add Mtma,</v>

4315
02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:08.580
<v Speaker 3>then people can integrate it more helpfully.</v>

4316
02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Have you done any studies,</v>

4317
02:24:10.191 --> 02:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>like with the differences between like hippie flipping and candy flipping using</v>

4318
02:24:13.341 --> 02:24:14.510
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms instead of,</v>

4319
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4320
02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:16.900
<v Speaker 2>is there any difference to that or,</v>

4321
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:17.610
<v Speaker 3>well again,</v>

4322
02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:19.080
<v Speaker 3>we haven't done any studies,</v>

4323
02:24:19.081 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4324
02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:24.000
<v Speaker 3>This can't be because combining drugs but more or less it's,</v>

4325
02:24:24.001 --> 02:24:24.631
<v Speaker 3>it's similar.</v>

4326
02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 3>MTMA blends with ketamine,</v>

4327
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:31.410
<v Speaker 3>even MTMA grounds people with ketamine ground shame.</v>

4328
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:32.541
<v Speaker 2>Why not about it?</v>

4329
02:24:32.541 --> 02:24:32.800
<v Speaker 2>What did it,</v>

4330
02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:34.950
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to turn out to be like a jack and coke.</v>

4331
02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:35.911
<v Speaker 2>Well people were like,</v>

4332
02:24:35.911 --> 02:24:36.780
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you guys do this?</v>

4333
02:24:36.781 --> 02:24:39.000
<v Speaker 2>From the beginning it was my favorite thing in college.</v>

4334
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It was so hard to find.</v>

4335
02:24:41.071 --> 02:24:42.290
<v Speaker 2>But when you did you,</v>

4336
02:24:42.291 --> 02:24:43.910
<v Speaker 2>you bought a lot and you just saved,</v>

4337
02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.753
<v Speaker 2>you sat on this.</v>

4338
02:24:45.090 --> 02:24:46.060
<v Speaker 2>How did you do it?</v>

4339
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Did in terms of the timing,</v>

4340
02:24:47.341 --> 02:24:48.720
<v Speaker 2>cause I I'm talking about where,</v>

4341
02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:49.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4342
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:55.220
<v Speaker 2>did you take them both at the same time or actually a designed together where it</v>

4343
02:24:55.471 --> 02:24:55.921
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

4344
02:24:55.921 --> 02:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>it was like a candy where it had both of the chemicals in it.</v>

4345
02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:00.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way I've ever done it.</v>

4346
02:25:00.961 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Now I've done it since then but done it separately with mushrooms and then just</v>

4347
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:06.030
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>

4348
02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4349
02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:06.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4350
02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:08.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah I think it was,</v>

4351
02:25:08.370 --> 02:25:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I took it when I was peaking.</v>

4352
02:25:10.261 --> 02:25:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I would dose myself with the Mali,</v>

4353
02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:16.710
<v Speaker 2>which would then take whatever an hour or so 45 minutes later you'd start</v>

4354
02:25:16.711 --> 02:25:17.544
<v Speaker 2>feeling it.</v>

4355
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:18.510
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4356
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.961
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

4357
02:25:18.961 --> 02:25:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I love those two together.</v>

4358
02:25:21.010 --> 02:25:21.661
<v Speaker 2>If you need any,</v>

4359
02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 2>if there's a way to sign up to any of your things,</v>

4360
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:24.611
<v Speaker 3>let me know.</v>

4361
02:25:24.611 --> 02:25:28.240
<v Speaker 3>I was robbed by gunpoint so I got the post traumatic stress if you need that.</v>

4362
02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Well we need people to be,</v>

4363
02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it's not as easy as getting a prescription for marijuana to get a nurse study</v>

4364
02:25:34.201 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>

4365
02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:35.920
<v Speaker 3>We have independent raters.</v>

4366
02:25:35.930 --> 02:25:39.930
<v Speaker 3>She would have to have treatment resistant means you have to have had PTSD and</v>

4367
02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:41.093
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis.</v>

4368
02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.500
<v Speaker 7>Very minor compared to like a soldier PTSD too.</v>

4369
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:48.670
<v Speaker 7>They're dealing with real debilitating issues.</v>

4370
02:25:48.671 --> 02:25:49.960
<v Speaker 7>You just got freaked out one night.</v>

4371
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Well I got a gun in my chest and I thought I was going to die and it was,</v>

4372
02:25:53.170 --> 02:25:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I scared of black people for six months and it still comes back to me once in a</v>

4373
02:25:56.371 --> 02:25:57.330
<v Speaker 3>while when it's dark out.</v>

4374
02:25:57.390 --> 02:25:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4375
02:25:57.810 --> 02:25:58.410
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4376
02:25:58.410 --> 02:26:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Well people can sign up online to donate to maps because we're funded by</v>

4377
02:26:04.210 --> 02:26:05.070
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>

4378
02:26:05.071 --> 02:26:07.800
<v Speaker 3>The pharmaceutical companies aren't interested because these drugs are off</v>

4379
02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:09.420
<v Speaker 3>patent and they're only offered a few times.</v>

4380
02:26:09.421 --> 02:26:11.550
<v Speaker 3>So far we've not been able to get a government grant,</v>

4381
02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:14.460
<v Speaker 3>although we are working with the national instead of mental health.</v>

4382
02:26:14.461 --> 02:26:15.294
<v Speaker 3>And we are,</v>

4383
02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:15.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4384
02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia recently sent a letter to the assistant</v>

4385
02:26:20.131 --> 02:26:21.810
<v Speaker 3>secretary of defense for health affairs,</v>

4386
02:26:22.350 --> 02:26:23.183
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4387
02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:24.211
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>

4388
02:26:24.211 --> 02:26:24.361
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4389
02:26:24.361 --> 02:26:26.580
<v Speaker 3>MDA PTSD research should be looked into.</v>

4390
02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:27.061
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4391
02:26:27.061 --> 02:26:30.900
<v Speaker 3>but we have yet to obtain any kind of federal funding or pharmaceutical funding</v>

4392
02:26:30.901 --> 02:26:33.510
<v Speaker 3>or major pharmaceutical or major foundations.</v>

4393
02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:37.770
<v Speaker 3>So we're more individuals and family foundations trying to bring this,</v>

4394
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4395
02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:39.960
<v Speaker 3>research forward.</v>

4396
02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:40.331
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4397
02:26:40.331 --> 02:26:42.010
<v Speaker 7>I think what you're doing is awesome cause you,</v>

4398
02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:42.211
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4399
02:26:42.211 --> 02:26:44.110
<v Speaker 7>you guys are bringing legitimacy to this.</v>

4400
02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:48.760
<v Speaker 7>It would never be done by guys like Brian or myself and a or any of the other</v>

4401
02:26:48.761 --> 02:26:51.310
<v Speaker 7>people that are out there enjoying the fruits of your labor.</v>

4402
02:26:51.311 --> 02:26:55.700
<v Speaker 7>And the fact that these doors have been broken down now on or open,</v>

4403
02:26:55.701 --> 02:26:56.410
<v Speaker 7>I should say,</v>

4404
02:26:56.410 --> 02:27:00.940
<v Speaker 7>and work is being done and evidence is being put forth that really can't be</v>

4405
02:27:00.941 --> 02:27:01.900
<v Speaker 7>refuted anymore.</v>

4406
02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:04.260
<v Speaker 7>It's slowly but slowly starting to accumulate.</v>

4407
02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4408
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I would say that this can't be refuted.</v>

4409
02:27:07.161 --> 02:27:10.700
<v Speaker 3>We're right now we're at this stage where we have to replicate our results</v>

4410
02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:12.650
<v Speaker 3>because that's the key part of science.</v>

4411
02:27:12.651 --> 02:27:12.801
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

4412
02:27:12.801 --> 02:27:13.940
<v Speaker 3>you may have done it once,</v>

4413
02:27:13.941 --> 02:27:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but can you do it again and again and again?</v>

4414
02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:20.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's where we have still to prove.</v>

4415
02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.140
<v Speaker 3>So we haven't completely proven our case yet.</v>

4416
02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4417
02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:25.933
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

4418
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4419
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:27.081
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>

4420
02:27:27.081 --> 02:27:28.130
<v Speaker 3>we hope in that direction.</v>

4421
02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:28.730
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4422
02:27:28.730 --> 02:27:29.600
<v Speaker 7>that's awesome man.</v>

4423
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:30.740
<v Speaker 7>And I think,</v>

4424
02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:31.190
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4425
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:33.410
<v Speaker 7>I think there's really exciting things coming up.</v>

4426
02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:34.633
<v Speaker 7>I really do.</v>

4427
02:27:34.700 --> 02:27:37.340
<v Speaker 7>I feel like our culture is starting to shift.</v>

4428
02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.361
<v Speaker 7>And a,</v>

4429
02:27:38.361 --> 02:27:43.070
<v Speaker 7>I think it's stuff like what you're doing is a big part of that.</v>

4430
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:44.210
<v Speaker 7>Getting that information,</v>

4431
02:27:44.390 --> 02:27:45.820
<v Speaker 7>having that on the Internet land,</v>

4432
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:47.090
<v Speaker 7>allowing people to share links,</v>

4433
02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.350
<v Speaker 7>allowing people to go to,</v>

4434
02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:52.100
<v Speaker 7>whether it's maps.org or any of the different website.</v>

4435
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:54.470
<v Speaker 7>erowid.org era was a great website.</v>

4436
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.580
<v Speaker 7>Their fiscal</v>

4437
02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:56.151
<v Speaker 3>sponsor,</v>

4438
02:27:56.151 --> 02:27:57.440
<v Speaker 3>we went to college together.</v>

4439
02:27:58.790 --> 02:28:01.760
<v Speaker 3>We try to help other organizations in that way.</v>

4440
02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:02.451
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4441
02:28:02.451 --> 02:28:07.451
<v Speaker 3>I think this idea of getting honest information out for people to make their own</v>

4442
02:28:07.941 --> 02:28:08.810
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>

4443
02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4444
02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:10.640
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're about.</v>

4445
02:28:10.970 --> 02:28:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of time,</v>

4446
02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4447
02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>

4448
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4449
02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Well my dad is hilarious.</v>

4450
02:28:14.421 --> 02:28:19.421
<v Speaker 3>My Dad is 86 and three quarters and he sent me an email today and it said,</v>

4451
02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:20.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4452
02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:23.810
<v Speaker 3>here's a link to an about a marijuana reform.</v>

4453
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:24.350
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

4454
02:28:24.350 --> 02:28:24.501
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4455
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be legal in my lifetime.</v>

4456
02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4457
02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4458
02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:29.001
<v Speaker 3>Dad.</v>

4459
02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:29.301
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4460
02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I hope you're right.</v>

4461
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:30.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4462
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:32.300
<v Speaker 3>even if you have to live another 20 years,</v>

4463
02:28:32.530 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I would have never thought in 2013 it was still being illegal.</v>

4464
02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.351
<v Speaker 3>And when I was a kid,</v>

4465
02:28:36.351 --> 02:28:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

4466
02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a matter of time.</v>

4467
02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4468
02:28:38.490 --> 02:28:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I was on the board of normal for awhile,</v>

4469
02:28:40.850 --> 02:28:45.850
<v Speaker 3>quite awhile and I was with people who started normal in 1970 and 71 and thought</v>

4470
02:28:46.161 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>it would be legal in a few years.</v>

4471
02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:49.340
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of temper is my,</v>

4472
02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4473
02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:52.460
<v Speaker 3>sense of time to be with people who,</v>

4474
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:53.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4475
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:54.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4476
02:28:54.021 --> 02:28:57.080
<v Speaker 3>over 40 years ago thought it was only going to be a few years away that</v>

4477
02:28:57.081 --> 02:28:58.070
<v Speaker 3>marijuana would be legal.</v>

4478
02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately they're still working to try to help bring that about.</v>

4479
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when you see that it's still illegal after all</v>

4480
02:29:05.650 --> 02:29:05.960
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

4481
02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:06.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4482
02:29:06.231 --> 02:29:07.370
<v Speaker 3>it's the um,</v>

4483
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:08.663
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>

4484
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a worthy,</v>

4485
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:10.820
<v Speaker 3>like on a worthy opponent.</v>

4486
02:29:10.850 --> 02:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a worthy goal.</v>

4487
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.020
<v Speaker 3>And so I think we just do what we want to do.</v>

4488
02:29:15.021 --> 02:29:20.021
<v Speaker 3>There's times when I felt like I was so blocked that I needed to do something</v>

4489
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:22.790
<v Speaker 3>where I could actually see change.</v>

4490
02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:25.640
<v Speaker 3>And so I stopped work for a week and painted my house</v>

4491
02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:28.430
<v Speaker 3>and that was great.</v>

4492
02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:30.430
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

4493
02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Must must get some feel like you're spinning your wheels sometimes.</v>

4494
02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Well for years and we just spent four years with a Health Canada to trying to</v>

4495
02:29:40.431 --> 02:29:44.660
<v Speaker 3>get an import export permit to bring in eight grams of MDA.</v>

4496
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:49.660
<v Speaker 3>And this is after Health Canada had approved the protocol and our IRB had</v>

4497
02:29:49.791 --> 02:29:51.320
<v Speaker 3>approved of protocol and the,</v>

4498
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:52.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4499
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:56.540
<v Speaker 3>four years it took and they went through all these ridiculous things about the</v>

4500
02:29:56.541 --> 02:29:58.820
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy had to have bulletproof glass,</v>

4501
02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:00.890
<v Speaker 3>it had to have all these alarm systems,</v>

4502
02:30:00.970 --> 02:30:04.550
<v Speaker 3>class people are going to come in and steal your eight grams of acid.</v>

4503
02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:06.470
<v Speaker 3>That was eight grams.</v>

4504
02:30:06.471 --> 02:30:06.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4505
02:30:06.651 --> 02:30:11.090
<v Speaker 3>That would be in a safe and the safe had to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and</v>

4506
02:30:11.091 --> 02:30:15.410
<v Speaker 3>the safe had to be bolted to them before they went harder than the u s it was</v>

4507
02:30:15.411 --> 02:30:16.244
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

4508
02:30:16.310 --> 02:30:17.720
<v Speaker 3>But we eventually,</v>

4509
02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4510
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:19.430
<v Speaker 3>prevailed.</v>

4511
02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:21.770
<v Speaker 3>We just took every ridiculous thing and we did it.</v>

4512
02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4513
02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:23.780
<v Speaker 3>my policy is surrender.</v>

4514
02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:24.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4515
02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:28.400
<v Speaker 3>when there's certain kinds of irrational things coming from people who are more</v>

4516
02:30:28.401 --> 02:30:28.910
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>

4517
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:29.743
<v Speaker 3>try to give it to them.</v>

4518
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Well that's probably why you're in the position that you're in your facilitator</v>

4519
02:30:34.461 --> 02:30:34.850
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>

4520
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to dialogue venture forth.</v>

4521
02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:38.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4522
02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4523
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And there are parts that are exciting,</v>

4524
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.440
<v Speaker 3>that are connections that you know,</v>

4525
02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:45.590
<v Speaker 3>are just coming together.</v>

4526
02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Like even for the national incident mental health there,</v>

4527
02:30:47.850 --> 02:30:48.740
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

4528
02:30:48.741 --> 02:30:49.574
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4529
02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:50.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4530
02:30:50.450 --> 02:30:52.040
<v Speaker 3>in the late 1980s,</v>

4531
02:30:52.041 --> 02:30:54.740
<v Speaker 3>the fellow who's the current head of the nationalist of mental health was doing</v>

4532
02:30:54.741 --> 02:30:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Mtma neurotoxicity research in animals.</v>

4533
02:30:57.261 --> 02:31:00.350
<v Speaker 3>And I visited him and he was,</v>

4534
02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:00.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4535
02:31:00.890 --> 02:31:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4536
02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:05.280
<v Speaker 3>this sort of hidden away in the countryside animal research lab to,</v>

4537
02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:05.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4538
02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.970
<v Speaker 3>not attract all these animal rights protesters.</v>

4539
02:31:07.971 --> 02:31:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And we had to go through all his guards and Barb wire and stuff.</v>

4540
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:16.070
<v Speaker 3>But he seemed like he was sincerely interested in the question and wasn't trying</v>

4541
02:31:16.071 --> 02:31:19.130
<v Speaker 3>to twist the results to justify the drug war.</v>

4542
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And we developed a respect.</v>

4543
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I certainly respected him.</v>

4544
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:25.740
<v Speaker 3>And about two years ago,</v>

4545
02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:26.551
<v Speaker 3>year and a half ago,</v>

4546
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I wrote him an email and I hadn't talked to him.</v>

4547
02:31:29.390 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 3>And since that point he's now become the head of the national incident mental</v>

4548
02:31:31.861 --> 02:31:32.694
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

4549
02:31:32.730 --> 02:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And I just said,</v>

4550
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:37.860
<v Speaker 3>is now a good time to apply for a grant for MD May,</v>

4551
02:31:37.861 --> 02:31:40.800
<v Speaker 3>PTSD research or is it so politically hot?</v>

4552
02:31:40.801 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>It's just not worth it.</v>

4553
02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:42.931
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

4554
02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:43.800
<v Speaker 3>now is the time.</v>

4555
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:48.890
<v Speaker 3>And he appointed someone else inside the Nmh who is an expert at PTSD to help us</v>

4556
02:31:49.351 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 3>prepare applications that are more likely to be accepted.</v>

4557
02:31:54.240 --> 02:31:58.920
<v Speaker 3>But what he did say is that the actual decisions are made by peer reviewers,</v>

4558
02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.740
<v Speaker 3>the way they've set up for government money to be distributed,</v>

4559
02:32:01.741 --> 02:32:03.510
<v Speaker 3>that they bring in the scientist.</v>

4560
02:32:03.511 --> 02:32:08.430
<v Speaker 3>And he said the system of peer review as well known not to be sympathetic with</v>

4561
02:32:08.431 --> 02:32:09.264
<v Speaker 3>innovation.</v>

4562
02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:12.270
<v Speaker 3>So even though we have all the support,</v>

4563
02:32:12.271 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 3>it's still may not work.</v>

4564
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:17.310
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get systems to accept innovation and change.</v>

4565
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:21.450
<v Speaker 3>What can people at home that are listening to this podcast or watching it,</v>

4566
02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:22.720
<v Speaker 3>what can they do to,</v>

4567
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:27.300
<v Speaker 3>to help you to help keep this momentum going?</v>

4568
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:28.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4569
02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:29.041
<v Speaker 3>first off,</v>

4570
02:32:29.041 --> 02:32:30.060
<v Speaker 3>become a member.</v>

4571
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4572
02:32:30.810 --> 02:32:33.090
<v Speaker 3>sign up for a monthly membership.</v>

4573
02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4574
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:37.170
<v Speaker 3>we just had the incredible conference.</v>

4575
02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:42.330
<v Speaker 3>We're a psychedelic science 2013 largest psychedelic conference that we've ever</v>

4576
02:32:42.331 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 3>had in the u s over 1900 people.</v>

4577
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:46.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole,</v>

4578
02:32:46.051 --> 02:32:48.210
<v Speaker 3>I WASC attract the biggest Iowasca,</v>

4579
02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:48.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4580
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:50.820
<v Speaker 3>conference ever and clinical research.</v>

4581
02:32:50.821 --> 02:32:51.780
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

4582
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I was approached by a more Amara,</v>

4583
02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:59.480
<v Speaker 3>this group that helps groups crowdsource a transcription and translation of</v>

4584
02:33:00.091 --> 02:33:05.091
<v Speaker 3>these talks and videos are not searchable on Google,</v>

4585
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:09.000
<v Speaker 3>but when you do a transcript or if you do transcript of the shows,</v>

4586
02:33:09.001 --> 02:33:12.780
<v Speaker 3>people can then search on the transcripts in that gets them to the video.</v>

4587
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:13.861
<v Speaker 3>So people,</v>

4588
02:33:13.861 --> 02:33:14.850
<v Speaker 3>if they're interested,</v>

4589
02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.300
<v Speaker 3>and it would be a tremendous thing for them to learn to,</v>

4590
02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:19.980
<v Speaker 3>to go to the maps website,</v>

4591
02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:25.450
<v Speaker 3>map s.org to our psychedelic science 2013 conference page and you could sign up</v>

4592
02:33:26.011 --> 02:33:29.820
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to listen to some of these lectures,</v>

4593
02:33:29.821 --> 02:33:33.690
<v Speaker 3>which are tremendous and transcribe or translate them if you know other</v>

4594
02:33:33.691 --> 02:33:34.524
<v Speaker 3>languages.</v>

4595
02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

4596
02:33:35.310 --> 02:33:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4597
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:37.140
<v Speaker 3>there's other things people could do.</v>

4598
02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I just have a Twitter page.</v>

4599
02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:39.331
<v Speaker 3>We have Twitter,</v>

4600
02:33:39.331 --> 02:33:42.090
<v Speaker 3>we have a map maps.</v>

4601
02:33:42.091 --> 02:33:43.220
<v Speaker 3>News apps do is,</v>

4602
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4603
02:33:43.411 --> 02:33:46.280
<v Speaker 3>we have a tremendous social media team already.</v>

4604
02:33:46.310 --> 02:33:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Remember we are going to do a Indiegogo campaign starting probably in a week or</v>

4605
02:33:50.641 --> 02:33:55.641
<v Speaker 3>so to raise $10,000 for the Zendo project at burning man are harm reduction</v>

4606
02:33:56.250 --> 02:33:59.580
<v Speaker 3>program so people could tell other people about that.</v>

4607
02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:00.840
<v Speaker 3>And then we're going to go,</v>

4608
02:34:00.841 --> 02:34:02.400
<v Speaker 3>as we said earlier,</v>

4609
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:07.670
<v Speaker 3>to a probably a $250,000 request for the study with veterans with Mtma.</v>

4610
02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4611
02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I think people can come out to their families,</v>

4612
02:34:11.641 --> 02:34:16.260
<v Speaker 3>people can come out to people that they just talk about and not be so reticent</v>

4613
02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:20.080
<v Speaker 3>if psychedelics been helpful or even if they've not been helpful,</v>

4614
02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:20.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4615
02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:22.210
<v Speaker 3>to talk about how,</v>

4616
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:23.600
<v Speaker 3>what they learned about,</v>

4617
02:34:23.610 --> 02:34:25.480
<v Speaker 3>about what they think are these tools.</v>

4618
02:34:25.481 --> 02:34:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they use them poorly,</v>

4619
02:34:26.621 --> 02:34:27.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe they used them well,</v>

4620
02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:30.190
<v Speaker 3>but I think look at the gay rights movement and</v>

4621
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:31.463
<v Speaker 7>thinking about this,</v>

4622
02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:35.340
<v Speaker 7>the wrong tool for the wrong job too because they didn't have education about</v>

4623
02:34:35.341 --> 02:34:35.910
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

4624
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4625
02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.830
<v Speaker 3>And we're finding that people that sometimes you psychedelics at festivals for</v>

4626
02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:42.570
<v Speaker 3>what I would say is the wrong reason,</v>

4627
02:34:42.571 --> 02:34:45.270
<v Speaker 3>just to have a fun time and not the right reason.</v>

4628
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Well you told us it's beautiful,</v>

4629
02:34:48.481 --> 02:34:51.510
<v Speaker 3>but I think you have to be ready for the difficult stuff.</v>

4630
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:54.450
<v Speaker 3>And if you're trying to suppress the difficult stuff,</v>

4631
02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:56.790
<v Speaker 3>that's when people get into trouble.</v>

4632
02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>You should have more joking around.</v>

4633
02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:02.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think the celebratory use is really important.</v>

4634
02:35:02.761 --> 02:35:07.761
<v Speaker 3>And that's why for us medicalization is not the for maps as a five o one c three</v>

4635
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:10.260
<v Speaker 3>not change to change the laws.</v>

4636
02:35:10.290 --> 02:35:11.730
<v Speaker 3>We're about medicalization.</v>

4637
02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.150
<v Speaker 3>But I think as a society we need spiritual use.</v>

4638
02:35:15.151 --> 02:35:16.200
<v Speaker 3>We need personal growth,</v>

4639
02:35:16.201 --> 02:35:16.831
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>

4640
02:35:16.831 --> 02:35:19.770
<v Speaker 3>We need a broader drug policy,</v>

4641
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:24.690
<v Speaker 3>which would have adults have the right to use psychedelics.</v>

4642
02:35:24.691 --> 02:35:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be like the driver's license model where you would perhaps have</v>

4643
02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:30.560
<v Speaker 3>a certain education,</v>

4644
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:34.380
<v Speaker 3>you have to pass a test and maybe even to start out.</v>

4645
02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:35.650
<v Speaker 3>So we avoid backlash.</v>

4646
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:39.000
<v Speaker 3>There would be psychedelic clinics where you would go have an experience under</v>

4647
02:35:39.390 --> 02:35:41.310
<v Speaker 3>supervision and if you did it well,</v>

4648
02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4649
02:35:42.210 --> 02:35:44.120
<v Speaker 3>meaning you didn't totally flip out or you know,</v>

4650
02:35:44.130 --> 02:35:45.720
<v Speaker 3>then you would have the right to buy it on your own.</v>

4651
02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:48.660
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we would do with children,</v>

4652
02:35:48.661 --> 02:35:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I think drugs would be illegal for minors,</v>

4653
02:35:51.481 --> 02:35:52.500
<v Speaker 3>legal for adults.</v>

4654
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:57.830
<v Speaker 3>But 23 states in the United States have a parental override for alcohol that if</v>

4655
02:35:59.491 --> 02:36:02.070
<v Speaker 3>you want to give your kid alcohol in 23 states,</v>

4656
02:36:02.071 --> 02:36:02.904
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

4657
02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.020
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's how we handle under h is that we leave it,</v>

4658
02:36:07.290 --> 02:36:09.570
<v Speaker 3>not the government prohibited at all,</v>

4659
02:36:09.571 --> 02:36:13.320
<v Speaker 3>but that it's families decide among themselves how they want to handle it.</v>

4660
02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:15.053
<v Speaker 7>That's awesome.</v>

4661
02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:17.310
<v Speaker 7>One more question then I'm gonna let you go.</v>

4662
02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:17.940
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4663
02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:22.440
<v Speaker 7>Terence Mckenna's stoned ape theory was a fascinating,</v>

4664
02:36:22.441 --> 02:36:27.441
<v Speaker 7>the proposal that human beings evolved from lower hominids because we got in</v>

4665
02:36:28.351 --> 02:36:32.340
<v Speaker 7>contact with psychedelic mushrooms and his theory,</v>

4666
02:36:32.341 --> 02:36:33.630
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's correct,</v>

4667
02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:35.430
<v Speaker 7>but according to him and his brother,</v>

4668
02:36:35.610 --> 02:36:36.271
<v Speaker 7>his brother,</v>

4669
02:36:36.271 --> 02:36:36.600
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4670
02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:39.120
<v Speaker 7>if you just Google search the,</v>

4671
02:36:39.121 --> 02:36:39.600
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4672
02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:41.100
<v Speaker 7>Dennis Mckenna podcast,</v>

4673
02:36:41.101 --> 02:36:42.300
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember which number it is.</v>

4674
02:36:42.570 --> 02:36:44.670
<v Speaker 7>You can find it pretty easily and it with a quick search.</v>

4675
02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:49.290
<v Speaker 7>But he gave some really interesting scientific reasons for why he believes it's,</v>

4676
02:36:49.350 --> 02:36:52.140
<v Speaker 7>it's a very possible that that's what happened.</v>

4677
02:36:52.350 --> 02:36:55.530
<v Speaker 7>The doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years.</v>

4678
02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:57.490
<v Speaker 7>All this attributed to sy silicide.</v>

4679
02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:57.920
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4680
02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Dennis was one of the speakers at the conference and so people could actually</v>

4681
02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.590
<v Speaker 3>translate and transcribe his talk if they wanted.</v>

4682
02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

4683
02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

4684
02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:06.450
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the,</v>

4685
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.970
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4686
02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:11.970
<v Speaker 3>the deeper question is can the apes that we are today evolve further with</v>

4687
02:37:13.161 --> 02:37:13.994
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms?</v>

4688
02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:16.100
<v Speaker 3>And I think answer to that is clearly</v>

4689
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.690
<v Speaker 4>yes clear whether the apes of several million years or a hundred thousand years</v>

4690
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:21.650
<v Speaker 4>ago it used mushrooms.</v>

4691
02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:26.240
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly plausible and I hard to say one way or the other.</v>

4692
02:37:26.241 --> 02:37:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I am not in a position to say I believe it or not.</v>

4693
02:37:28.821 --> 02:37:32.920
<v Speaker 4>I think Terrence said some things that were pretty um,</v>

4694
02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:34.070
<v Speaker 4>exaggerated.</v>

4695
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Like this whole idea that the end of the Mayan calendar was going to be the end</v>

4696
02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:38.331
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

4697
02:37:38.331 --> 02:37:41.230
<v Speaker 4>And while I was in a cable,</v>

4698
02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:45.080
<v Speaker 4>well he talked about a massive constants in a shift and it would all be</v>

4699
02:37:45.081 --> 02:37:47.230
<v Speaker 4>different and like per space,</v>

4700
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 4>he talked about that we were going to reach a point of technological</v>

4701
02:37:52.131 --> 02:37:52.964
<v Speaker 4>singularity.</v>

4702
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:57.230
<v Speaker 4>He thought that we were going to reach a point of infinite novelty and that</v>

4703
02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:02.180
<v Speaker 4>right tracking it with his TimeWave zero algorithm that he created,</v>

4704
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:05.840
<v Speaker 4>he created this really sketchy thing when he was on mushrooms because based on</v>

4705
02:38:05.841 --> 02:38:09.590
<v Speaker 4>the each thing that's supposedly a map novelty or human innovation that you</v>

4706
02:38:09.591 --> 02:38:10.490
<v Speaker 4>could put it through a graph.</v>

4707
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:12.290
<v Speaker 4>But I think when you get really fucking high,</v>

4708
02:38:12.291 --> 02:38:14.150
<v Speaker 4>you could see patterns in almost anything.</v>

4709
02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4710
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:15.740
<v Speaker 4>And he had this,</v>

4711
02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:20.800
<v Speaker 4>this eating pattern that he had chased down for like 20 plus years in created a</v>

4712
02:38:21.081 --> 02:38:23.210
<v Speaker 4>formal mathematical program.</v>

4713
02:38:23.390 --> 02:38:24.230
<v Speaker 4>He had some,</v>

4714
02:38:24.231 --> 02:38:24.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4715
02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:29.620
<v Speaker 4>mathematical experts actually engaged him in dialogue and one's in disagreement,</v>

4716
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.231
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4717
02:38:30.231 --> 02:38:30.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4718
02:38:30.381 --> 02:38:31.160
<v Speaker 4>So I think if,</v>

4719
02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:31.851
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>

4720
02:38:31.851 --> 02:38:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Mckenna just wrote a book brothers at the screaming abyss and there's a</v>

4721
02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.040
<v Speaker 4>good discussion about some of the criticism and the value of time wave zero.</v>

4722
02:38:42.801 --> 02:38:45.560
<v Speaker 4>So I was actually,</v>

4723
02:38:45.561 --> 02:38:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Terrance was the one that started help start MTMA research because we were at a</v>

4724
02:38:49.521 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 4>conference at Esselyn,</v>

4725
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.600
<v Speaker 4>it was in 1983 and it was already clear because of Dallas and stuff that Mtma</v>

4726
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:58.190
<v Speaker 4>was being used in public setting.</v>

4727
02:38:58.191 --> 02:38:59.780
<v Speaker 4>And that the crackdown would come.</v>

4728
02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:04.240
<v Speaker 4>And so the underground therapists and the shoguns chemists,</v>

4729
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:06.590
<v Speaker 4>so we had this meeting to figure out what to do.</v>

4730
02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4731
02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.650
<v Speaker 4>and Terrence was like,</v>

4732
02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 4>forget about Mtma it's from the lab.</v>

4733
02:39:12.681 --> 02:39:13.760
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be a plant,</v>

4734
02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:14.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4735
02:39:14.241 --> 02:39:14.871
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>

4736
02:39:14.871 --> 02:39:16.010
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years,</v>

4737
02:39:16.011 --> 02:39:16.970
<v Speaker 4>plants are better,</v>

4738
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:17.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4739
02:39:17.211 --> 02:39:18.200
<v Speaker 4>we can trust them,</v>

4740
02:39:18.201 --> 02:39:20.600
<v Speaker 4>they're from nature and you know,</v>

4741
02:39:20.601 --> 02:39:23.810
<v Speaker 4>and look at all these risks of Mtma and all this stuff.</v>

4742
02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

4743
02:39:25.371 --> 02:39:26.204
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4744
02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:28.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't see these risks.</v>

4745
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:29.083
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

4746
02:39:29.350 --> 02:39:29.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4747
02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:34.660
<v Speaker 4>and I also don't believe that plants are drugs from plants are inherently better</v>

4748
02:39:35.601 --> 02:39:36.790
<v Speaker 4>tools that,</v>

4749
02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:40.280
<v Speaker 4>that we're part of nature that comes from the human mind is out there.</v>

4750
02:39:40.310 --> 02:39:41.143
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

4751
02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:43.280
<v Speaker 4>I'll put up $1,000 towards an MDA study.</v>

4752
02:39:43.281 --> 02:39:44.690
<v Speaker 4>We'll see how risky it really is.</v>

4753
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:46.190
<v Speaker 4>And then Dick Price,</v>

4754
02:39:46.191 --> 02:39:47.900
<v Speaker 4>who founded Eslan like 30 seconds,</v>

4755
02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:48.680
<v Speaker 4>10 seconds later,</v>

4756
02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:48.861
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

4757
02:39:48.861 --> 02:39:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I'll put up a thousand hours.</v>

4758
02:39:49.850 --> 02:39:54.380
<v Speaker 4>And so it was in response to Terrence going on about plant medicines being best</v>

4759
02:39:54.381 --> 02:39:59.381
<v Speaker 4>and MD may being super dangerous that we did this study and kept it quiet until</v>

4760
02:40:00.231 --> 02:40:01.670
<v Speaker 4>the DEA moved to criminalize.</v>

4761
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:03.050
<v Speaker 4>And then we surfaced with the study.</v>

4762
02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:04.350
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

4763
02:40:04.351 --> 02:40:05.184
<v Speaker 4>Well that's great.</v>

4764
02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4765
02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:07.070
<v Speaker 4>that's very funny.</v>

4766
02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to hear different people's take on that fear because I</v>

4767
02:40:10.551 --> 02:40:11.870
<v Speaker 4>thought it was a fascinating theory.</v>

4768
02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.900
<v Speaker 4>The idea that humans became us because of psychedelics.</v>

4769
02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:20.220
<v Speaker 4>And the best culprit is mushrooms because they're like sort of built in.</v>

4770
02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:22.410
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to cook and you have to do anything weird.</v>

4771
02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:22.890
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to,</v>

4772
02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:23.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4773
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.810
<v Speaker 4>extract anything,</v>

4774
02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:27.000
<v Speaker 4>just chew away and boom,</v>

4775
02:40:27.090 --> 02:40:28.020
<v Speaker 4>here comes the boom.</v>

4776
02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:28.441
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4777
02:40:28.441 --> 02:40:33.441
<v Speaker 4>I felt when I had my bar Mitzvah when I was 13 it did not turn me into a man</v>

4778
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 4>coming of age.</v>

4779
02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:40.740
<v Speaker 4>That's a really unrealistic expectation to 13 shit.</v>

4780
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:42.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was the oldest of four.</v>

4781
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:42.841
<v Speaker 4>That's what my parents,</v>

4782
02:40:42.841 --> 02:40:44.230
<v Speaker 4>so that's what I expect.</v>

4783
02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:44.851
<v Speaker 4>That belt went,</v>

4784
02:40:44.851 --> 02:40:47.790
<v Speaker 4>came up with that back when people only live in to be 30 yeah.</v>

4785
02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 4>So when I,</v>

4786
02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>and I was disappointed,</v>

4787
02:40:50.611 --> 02:40:51.444
<v Speaker 4>I was the same.</v>

4788
02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:52.760
<v Speaker 4>It was really Bauer.</v>

4789
02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:53.310
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4790
02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:57.520
<v Speaker 4>I remember being in bed for the whole week and I'm thinking a lot of people must</v>

4791
02:40:57.521 --> 02:41:00.090
<v Speaker 4>have had their bar mitzvahs that day and God must be slow.</v>

4792
02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:01.860
<v Speaker 4>And he'll come around to me eventually.</v>

4793
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.461
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>nothing happened.</v>

4798
02:41:05.461 --> 02:41:07.140

4799
02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 4>But when I took LSD for the first time,</v>

4800
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I felt that it touched the parts of my psyche that I had hoped my bar Mitzvah</v>

4801
02:41:14.821 --> 02:41:15.630
<v Speaker 4>would touch.</v>
