00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.503
<v Speaker 3>I really like,</v>

4
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's more than it is.</v>

5
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like what they were afraid of was pirate radio where everyone can have</v>

6
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 3>their own radio station.</v>

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to control that,</v>

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 3>regulate that.</v>

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.663
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember now,</v>

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 3>but now the podcast is way more pervasive than even just regular prior pirate</v>

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 3>pirate radio because you can listen to it when there's no radio signal.</v>

13
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 3>You can listen to her iPhone,</v>

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 3>iPad or an iPhone rather and,</v>

15
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.011
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

16
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 3>and keep that shit.</v>

17
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 3>You know in the gym you could,</v>

18
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 3>you could listen to it on planes so you could listen to it.</v>

19
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.311
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

20
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 3>you could have an iPod and take it with you in the bathroom if you want to.</v>

21
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 3>You can go swimming with those fucking,</v>

22
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 3>they have waterproof iPod containers.</v>

23
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 3>You can listen to that shit while you're swimming.</v>

24
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

25
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 3>there you need a reality show.</v>

26
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.953

29
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.043
<v Speaker 3>People would like to,</v>

30
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I like to watch you have one.</v>

31
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

32
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying you need one on TV.</v>

33
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Someone needs to snatch that shut up and just follow you around with</v>

34
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 3>professional cameras and shit.</v>

35
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:08.601
<v Speaker 3>the thing that you're doing,</v>

37
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm mastering the system is cool and it's letting people know,</v>

38
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.213
<v Speaker 3>oh no budget.</v>

39
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.213
<v Speaker 3>He rolled budget,</v>

40
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

41
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a little budget.</v>

42
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 3>I am paying someone to put it together,</v>

43
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's like minimal shit.</v>

44
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

45
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 3>If there was some kind of budget,</v>

46
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 3>it would be nice where I can have someone,</v>

47
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 3>when I can just tell someone to do anything and like a,</v>

48
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 3>like a producer dude and I go,</v>

00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:26.031
<v Speaker 3>I want that.</v>

51
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Once I get to the point where I have a guide that will just do everything that I</v>

54
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have time to do everything now.</v>

55
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.543
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

56
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Every day is packed with shit and I'm not even trying.</v>

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 3>it's sometimes it's hard to,</v>

75
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

76

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 3>You should be enjoying the moment right now.</v>

82
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:09.601
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

83
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Stressing them out this and stressing about that.</v>

84
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Forget about that.</v>

85
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I got it every day.</v>

86
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I got myself stripe stress though.</v>

87
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 3>So what keeps you pushing forward?</v>

88
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes you,</v>

89
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:19.161
<v Speaker 3>what motivates you?</v>

90
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 3>That same drive,</v>

91
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 3>even though sometimes a fresh jar,</v>

92
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 3>it's all this energy that you built up to try to become successful.</v>

93
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to become successful and be really laid back at the same time.</v>

94
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times people just don't push far enough.</v>

95
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just you've got to learn when to chill out and when not to.</v>

96
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 3>But in order to really push forward,</v>

97
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be pretty intense,</v>

98
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

99
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 3>to really get shit done.</v>

100
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.151
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

101
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.361
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

102
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to be laid back and to get shit done.</v>

103
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

104
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 3>you've got to get got to get her up,</v>

105
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.070

<v Speaker 3>Crazy shit.</v>

109
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 3>It's all good stuff though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Katy Perry song.</v>

451
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.250
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

452
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Portland is the shit.</v>

453
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.850
<v Speaker 3>This town is awesome.</v>

454
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the coolest,</v>

455
00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:36.490
<v Speaker 3>most positive,</v>

456
00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:38.950
<v Speaker 3>most fun crowds we've ever had.</v>

457
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Never has anyone handed me more weed in any town anywhere.</v>

458
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a close second.</v>

459
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Portland dominated in the weed passing out department,</v>

460
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.930
<v Speaker 3>not even close in.</v>

461
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:54.931
<v Speaker 3>The crowds are cool as fuck and what we're seeing for sure this weekend is that</v>

462
00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:57.490
<v Speaker 3>we're getting podcast fans now.</v>

463
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost all podcast fans who saw that last week in Seattle.</v>

464
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Although joy could attend because of previous warrants,</v>

465
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.390
<v Speaker 3>the probably that we're going to get done and taken care of.</v>

466
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Well we're going to contract out little representatives and see what the fuck is</v>

467
00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:13.224
<v Speaker 3>going down.</v>

468
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.970
<v Speaker 3>But Portland was the shit man.</v>

469
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.830
<v Speaker 3>This is a on a shortlist man.</v>

470
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.470
<v Speaker 3>As far as like bad ass cool cities for me,</v>

471
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.640
<v Speaker 3>this is on a short list.</v>

472
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.391
<v Speaker 3>There's like Austin,</v>

473
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:22.931
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

474
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Portland is right the fuck up there with Austin in my opinion.</v>

475
00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:31.711
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think people are cool as fuck here and the podcast crowds or this is a</v>

476
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:33.480
<v Speaker 3>different crowd man.</v>

477
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.720
<v Speaker 3>We're getting a different crowd now.</v>

478
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.950
<v Speaker 3>We're getting there.</v>

479
00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:37.840
<v Speaker 3>All fucking nice man.</v>

480
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.480
<v Speaker 3>This is one thing that waitresses say and they've,</v>

481
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:40.691
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

482
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:42.370
<v Speaker 3>they've just been saying this for a long time,</v>

483
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.750
<v Speaker 3>but even more so now,</v>

484
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:48.751
<v Speaker 3>like today day they kept going on about how friendly the people know.</v>

485
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:54.290
<v Speaker 3>That to me is almost more satisfying than anything else.</v>

486
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 3>The fact they're loving the show,</v>

487
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 3>the fact they're coming to having a great time,</v>

488
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.681
<v Speaker 3>that's all great.</v>

489
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>But what really makes me feel good is that I hear that they're nice.</v>

490
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>I hear the crowds now.</v>

491
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.394
<v Speaker 3>One problem.</v>

492
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.640

<v Speaker 5>I used to come down here in the late nineties and it was Harvey's at Harvey's</v>

575
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:15.541
<v Speaker 5>was a good club,</v>

576
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 5>but there's too many restrictions.</v>

577
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:17.514
<v Speaker 5>You can't curse.</v>

578
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 5>So just a certain amount of comic.</v>

582
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Doug Stanhope and me.</v>

583
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

584
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.613
<v Speaker 5>That's what that was like</v>

585
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.463
<v Speaker 3>crazy</v>

586
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.870
<v Speaker 5>putting the drugs or be a magician.</v>

587
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.110
<v Speaker 5>So when the helium opened,</v>

588
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.520
<v Speaker 5>they brought a different type of comic up here,</v>

589
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.480
<v Speaker 5>which opened up the door for a lot of different comics that wouldn't be allowed</v>

590
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:40.060
<v Speaker 5>to come up here because of the budget restrictions or Harvey's or whatnot.</v>

591
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.313
<v Speaker 5>And I'll tell you man,</v>

592
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.470
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why I hate trial was because of the club's fucking with you.</v>

593
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 3>This club and the city was outrageous.</v>

594
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>How they are in Philly</v>

595
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

596
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 5>you know fairly is incredible.</v>

597
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 5>Outrageous.</v>

598
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.783
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

599
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy I can't thank you Paul.</v>

600
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh please.</v>

601
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.220
<v Speaker 5>Thank you for the 55 fucking joints and smoking.</v>

602
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

603
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 5>it'd be sick again Tuesday cause I can't smoke with people pipes.</v>

604
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 5>I smoke where everybody,</v>

605
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.480
<v Speaker 5>if they were that nice I have to make it out of Portland and did,</v>

606
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.000
<v Speaker 5>we just got done smoking like eight bulls and 17 joints.</v>

607
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 5>There was one where I'm like holding two joints on one goal.</v>

608
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.340
<v Speaker 5>It was like being in the eighth grade that was looking at his phone and she'll</v>

609
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 5>be in the eight grade.</v>

610
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 5>And the first thing I was telling Joel,</v>

611
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 5>there was 60 people,</v>

612
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:21.874
<v Speaker 5>40 people,</v>

613
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

614
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 5>like a six groups of like six people and we were smoking and the cop stopped</v>

615
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 5>looking at us and just kept fucking driving like he thought that restaurant,</v>

616
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.921
<v Speaker 5>well I've,</v>

617
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 5>I felt like the vibes of the crowd,</v>

618
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 5>they fell to me like a real,</v>

619
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 5>like a real strong potheads.</v>

620
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 5>It was like a strong pothead crowd.</v>

621
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 5>Like that might've been like 90% stoners.</v>

622
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.331
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

623
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:47.380
<v Speaker 5>And it was so great because</v>

624
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 5>everybody was cool as fuck.</v>

625
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Everyone said no,</v>

626
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 5>we grow out here.</v>

627
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 5>We don't have the stores.</v>

628
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:58.330
<v Speaker 5>We just grow our super gross.</v>

629
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 5>And apparently they don't give a fuck.</v>

630
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 5>They're not trying to force a shit at all.</v>

631
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I get guilt you're we'd known carries crazy because the club manager came</v>

632
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:08.270
<v Speaker 5>up to me 1130 last night.</v>

633
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:08.471
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

634
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:08.801
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

635
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 5>I just want to warn you,</v>

636
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.550
<v Speaker 5>if you guys did this on Friday,</v>

637
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Thursday,</v>

638
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow's will be completely nuts.</v>

639
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 5>And then went to eat with you guys.</v>

640
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Then I went up to my room and I started thinking about what he said and they</v>

641
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 5>grew up in my head like a fucking,</v>

642
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 5>we'd actually put too much pressure on me at five 30 I was already dressed and</v>

643
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:25.954
<v Speaker 5>showered.</v>

644
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.520
<v Speaker 5>That's how the crazy game,</v>

645
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 5>because my emotions come out when I'd be standing up.</v>

646
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 5>When I see people in the first show tonight,</v>

647
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 5>usually it's a Christian crowd on Saturday night and some people have</v>

648
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:38.074
<v Speaker 5>babysitters.</v>

649
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.160
<v Speaker 5>These people are fucking nuts.</v>

650
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 5>Thinking up the ride,</v>

651
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 5>they were eating their finger back.</v>

652
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.803
<v Speaker 5>They took the wrong,</v>

653
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.600
<v Speaker 5>she only wrote me and said,</v>

654
00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I went out there to watch him for 10 minutes and I was listening to you and I</v>

655
00:22:49.031 --> 00:22:49.900
<v Speaker 5>could feel these people,</v>

656
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 5>they were in with you.</v>

657
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 5>It was a movie.</v>

658
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 5>You'll watch a movie.</v>

659
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 5>It was something even sitting on the side of this place.</v>

660
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 5>So thank you bro.</v>

661
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.850
<v Speaker 5>Fucking stone work with me</v>

662
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.600
<v Speaker 5>is a bad ass town.</v>

663
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.860
<v Speaker 5>So in short town is unquestionably the shit.</v>

664
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 5>He was one of the best place we've ever been performed.</v>

665
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 5>One of the short lists of where to move when their pocket upsets.</v>

666
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Portland just shot right the fuck up the charts.</v>

667
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.100
<v Speaker 5>This is how fucking bad ass Portlanders whomever they have.</v>

668
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.290
<v Speaker 5>They have these solar powered compactor is solar panels on the top.</v>

669
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 5>The sunlight powers this fucking thing.</v>

670
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:37.650
<v Speaker 5>You throw the trash in there and it smashes it up into a nice usable cube,</v>

671
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 5>which if you were so inclined,</v>

672
00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 5>perhaps you could use for the construction.</v>

673
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Very biodegradable house.</v>

674
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 5>Either way,</v>

675
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 5>this is</v>

676
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.963
<v Speaker 2>bad ass shit.</v>

677
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Portland's ahead of the curve.</v>

678
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

679
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.120
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
