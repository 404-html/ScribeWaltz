<v Speaker 1>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

12
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a couple of years ago,</v>

13
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I were talking about books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian had just started doing his podcast</v>

14
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>at that point and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.514
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of interviewing strippers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of strippers or like porn stars </v>

16
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>mma guys and that was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

18
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

19
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.674
<v Speaker 1>if you enjoy these books so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we get on some of these </v>

20
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>professors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

21
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.743
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like professors would talk to me and I </v>

22
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your download numbers and you </v>

24
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.664
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me them and then I went off and </v>

25
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I liked the professors and like doubled </v>
<v Speaker 1>or tripled them to do it though.</v>

26
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.991
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:55.824
<v Speaker 1>as a result they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great because if you're a New </v>

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.733
<v Speaker 1>York Times best selling author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually have an audience of three </v>

29
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and so have a chance to like actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach a decent number of people,</v>

30
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:06.144
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come on this weird </v>

31
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

32
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

33
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.993
<v Speaker 1>And so we started getting all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors and academics and scientists </v>

35
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff on and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of been the journey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're now 200 plus episodes in.</v>

37
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Brian loves that kind of stuff.</v>

38
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.183
<v Speaker 1>But I wish that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you never talked about that on </v>

39
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

40
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>he wants to be captain silly face Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we willing to wander into the dark,</v>

41
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>dark place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Brian Collins mind dark place.</v>

42
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready to go there?</v>

43
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.911
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

45
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it comes down to Brian's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal insecurities.</v>

46
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.564
<v Speaker 1>Like he loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't feel confident engaging </v>

47
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>with and breakout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disagree with that.</v>

48
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say that he's just his comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he prefers it to be silly,</v>

49
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a difference between </v>

50
00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.813
<v Speaker 1>comedy and in Brian's mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially between what's really funny </v>

51
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>and what's really deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't find deep things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

53
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.614
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

54
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

55
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.423
<v Speaker 1>when he gets into deep subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of gets into them just for what </v>

56
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>they are and not like tries to translate</v>
<v Speaker 1>those into comedy.</v>

57
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense.</v>

58
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:20.994
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of what I've seen across the </v>

59
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>course of these 200 episodes is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brian Kellen is growing up.</v>

60
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh Way.</v>

61
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Finally it like whatever age he is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 5:55</v>

62
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.793
<v Speaker 1>There's starting to be an evolution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is just sort of having </v>

64
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>actually talked to some of the smartest </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the world.</v>

65
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.671
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

66
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:42.504
<v Speaker 1>these are just people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know certain ideas that I didn't </v>

67
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>know and now I know them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can.</v>

68
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And he even started experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you particularly got really excited.</v>

69
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.063
<v Speaker 1>We had a guy called Joe Henrich on who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote this great book called the secret </v>

70
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>of our success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>which is all about cultural evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural evolution works,</v>

72
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things he talks about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

73
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we have black people in,</v>

74
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.230
<v Speaker 1>why do we have white people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.731
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to vitamin D and foliate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these sorts of things.</v>

77
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Determine where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

78
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time in England and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got rid of most of my accent,</v>

79
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.430
<v Speaker 1>but there are weird words that come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like vitamin and being.</v>

80
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so sometimes people think I'm </v>

81
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.234
<v Speaker 1>Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious because they </v>

82
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>literally can't place it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Side story,</v>

83
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

84
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>when I first went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to major in linguistics for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile and I met with my linguistics </v>

86
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>professor and he sits me down and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a conversation just like this.</v>

87
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden he stops me </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you did.</v>

88
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

89
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And he proceeds to like ask me these </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking bizarre questions.</v>

90
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if John and Jane are in a race and John </v>

91
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>comes fifth and Jane comes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

92
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>what position does Jane come in?</v>

93
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And I was like sick and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British precedes to like do all of these</v>

94
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>tests basically spot my accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixth,</v>

95
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>sixth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no ask.</v>

96
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not sixth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>it's super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then medicine is the other one.</v>

98
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't say medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say medicine.</v>

99
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by sick.</v>

100
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

101
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.553
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because the Eq sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really a k and then an ass even </v>

102
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.784
<v Speaker 1>though we represented as an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he basically had all these tests and </v>

103
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:25.834
<v Speaker 1>he figured out pretty quickly that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pass as an American and he's </v>

104
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

105
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>white boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>

106
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>How long did you live in England for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years.</v>

107
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Ten years until your 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A from the age of eight until 18.</v>

108
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.113
<v Speaker 1>So if you were in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you started out without an English </v>

109
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.460
<v Speaker 1>accent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

110
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.293
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you learned English here and then </v>

111
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.533
<v Speaker 1>when you started speaking in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you sense that you were shifting </v>

112
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>over to nick and I sort of fought it.</v>

113
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I fought it and it's because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is,</v>

114
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>is that people naturally sort of start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

115
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:57.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tribe and you start to like </v>

116
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>pick up the values and the speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and all that sort of stuff with</v>

117
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

118
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I really thought of myself as American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

119
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>in large part because I identified with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom more than my dad.</v>

120
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happened was,</v>

121
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.281
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

123
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.583
<v Speaker 1>British accent creeping in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I fought that with everything </v>

124
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:17.824
<v Speaker 1>that I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in spite of fighting the accident </v>

125
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.314
<v Speaker 1>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could these words that like being in </v>

126
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>vitamin and medicine and sick that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't watching for,</v>

127
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>that no ordinary person would watch for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crept into my mind is always interesting</v>

128
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:31.444
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an added a insight that you get </v>

129
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>from people that come from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and then live in America.</v>

130
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>There's something different about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

131
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't know how weird this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking place.</v>

132
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Like I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived there.</v>

134
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:47.314
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those people have a different </v>

135
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:49.534
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different insight and also I think </v>

136
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.150
<v Speaker 1>we're so established in America in so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as thinking that this</v>

137
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>is how people live in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is where you go,</v>

138
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you go to Byrd Gang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right over there.</v>

139
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 2>You get on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right over here.</v>

140
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.783
<v Speaker 2>And we see our landscape and we see our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cityscapes and we see it as being </v>

141
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't go to another country,</v>

142
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.651
<v Speaker 2>you don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

143
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>this is normal to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is normal for them.</v>

144
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is normal for them.</v>

145
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

146
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>you really need to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think that's.</v>

147
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's absorbable from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>DVD.</v>

148
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it is,</v>

149
00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:28.014
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a large part of what we've been </v>

150
00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 1>doing and what Joe Henrich work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

151
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.280
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that tribe is,</v>

153
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:39.300
<v Speaker 1>whether that's America or Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>or mormonism or Islam or,</v>

154
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Papa New Guinea,</v>

155
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Ian's in the foothills of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.223
<v Speaker 1>Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea,</v>

157
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

158
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 1>that's our way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way things are done.</v>

159
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't question it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

160
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.530
<v Speaker 1>The tribe creates the sense that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what normalcy is.</v>

161
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the second you go outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe,</v>

162
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever that tribe is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suddenly like,</v>

163
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our tribe is fucking weird.</v>

164
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.030
<v Speaker 1>There are other ways of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

165
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.953
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of been a large part of the </v>

166
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.324
<v Speaker 1>experience that Brian and I had growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because Brian's dad was my dad's </v>

167
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:09.954
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>

168
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

169
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first place that I went after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was born in Saudi Arabia was Brian's </v>

170
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at work.</v>

171
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I went to Brian's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

172
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and so for the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and then we moved around and we moved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>

174
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.531
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

177
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:28.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did Saudi Arabia,</v>

178
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

179
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and then my parents moved to France and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya and the UAE and then,</v>

181
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to the US.</v>

182
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so moving constantly between tribes,</v>

183
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>like that was a large part of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience growing up as a kid was I was</v>

184
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.154
<v Speaker 1>constantly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are all the same and yet they're </v>

185
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:48.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does that work?</v>

186
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because I come from the background </v>

187
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 1>of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first response was like,</v>

188
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there must be science of this,</v>

189
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:56.824
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not go and look at that science and </v>

190
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:58.684
<v Speaker 1>see what the science says about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out there's a massive amount of </v>

191
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:02.230
<v Speaker 1>science all about it.</v>

192
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive amount of science all </v>

193
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.504
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so fascinating when you stop </v>

194
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:07.844
<v Speaker 2>and think that there are some people on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've seen the most recent </v>

195
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 2>photos of that uncontacted tribe now </v>
<v Speaker 2>contacted obviously in the Amazon,</v>

196
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>like really recently over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks.</v>

197
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

198
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>

199
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people were there.</v>

200
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.043
<v Speaker 2>They don't have American teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes you'll see like these </v>

201
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:24.134
<v Speaker 2>tribes and they're deep in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to tee shirts on and like </v>

202
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>can't get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

203
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

204
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:33.884
<v Speaker 2>There's none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been no interaction with the </v>

205
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:35.684
<v Speaker 2>West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have stick bows they've made and </v>

206
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.834
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all barefoot and all wearing </v>

207
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 2>leaves and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

208
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're here.</v>

209
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 2>They aren't trucking along in 2017 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think 50,</v>

210
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

211
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 2>They probably were living exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

212
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

213
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.173
<v Speaker 1>And what's fascinating is just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which those people have so </v>

214
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>much to teach us because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what happened,</v>

215
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.384
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of the enlightenment </v>

216
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.681
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

217
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Locke and Rousseau and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these guys,</v>

218
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to imagine the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

219
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're a group of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around in Europe.</v>

220
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>They've never met somebody from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon or someone from Papa New Guinea.</v>

221
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>And now we really have a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of what,</v>

222
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>what was life like before civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

223
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.963
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

224
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn fascinating.</v>

225
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean jared diamond has this great </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

226
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 1>the world until yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>which is literally all about life before</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

228
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And what are the things that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn as moderns from these people?</v>

229
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things they get right that </v>

230
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.274
<v Speaker 1>we get wrong?</v>

231
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what was his examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of interesting ones.</v>

233
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite ones is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive paranoia.</v>

234
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is when you have tribes,</v>

235
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:45.144
<v Speaker 1>people and they go outside of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>village and they suddenly become </v>

236
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>massively paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like incredibly paranoid and he's like,</v>

237
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are more paranoid than your</v>

238
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 1>average New York Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

239
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.063
<v Speaker 1>Like suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wandering around the forest and </v>

240
00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:59.124
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

241
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>is this tree gonna fall down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where can we sleep?</v>

242
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Like they go and they check the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look for footprints.</v>

243
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those the footprints of some other </v>

244
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:07.141
<v Speaker 1>tribe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

245
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that sound?</v>

246
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this paranoia about?</v>

247
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And for a long time he thought this </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid paranoia was just misplaced,</v>

248
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that it was inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he had this experience where he</v>

249
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>had a couple of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which was around,</v>

250
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

251
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>some other tribe that was potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill him in Papa New Guinea.</v>

252
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one was around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He basically was getting on this boat.</v>

253
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.683
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the west and you get on a </v>

254
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 1>boat at the New York Port Authority or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

255
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

256
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 1>this boat safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are safety rules.</v>

257
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Probably someone would check it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

258
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.014
<v Speaker 1>So he gets on this boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boat goes out into the ocean and </v>

259
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>like capsizes and sinks and he almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowned to death.</v>

260
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically because these kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were running the boat,</v>

261
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:49.224
<v Speaker 1>we're running it way too fast and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water kept sloshing over the side and </v>

262
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.334
<v Speaker 1>the highways and a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much water in the boat that </v>

263
00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>the boat goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

264
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're in that kind of environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these societies that doesn't have</v>

265
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 1>protections and doesn't have rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

266
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.063
<v Speaker 1>Being paranoid as super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most appropriate thing you can </v>

267
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he then talks about how,</v>

268
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in 70,</v>

269
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>80 year old man.</v>

270
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.773
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be more paranoid because the </v>

271
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:15.354
<v Speaker 1>reality is if I go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably because I slipped in the </v>

272
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:18.294
<v Speaker 1>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all these things that can </v>

273
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:21.714
<v Speaker 1>actually kill me in my environment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of take for granted because my </v>

274
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:25.794
<v Speaker 1>world seems so safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you learned </v>

275
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>from that is that paranoia is a tool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than a lot of people have trouble</v>

276
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>with paranoia where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>indiscriminately paranoid,</v>

277
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.313
<v Speaker 1>but the key is figuring out what to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid about when to be paranoid so </v>

278
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>that you're hyper alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alert to threats.</v>

279
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I would totally make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're very vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so soft and flushing.</v>

281
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:49.034
<v Speaker 1>Most of their body's exposed and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different poisonous things </v>

282
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and things</v>

283
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and cats and fucking spiders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell is out there.</v>

284
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.320
<v Speaker 1>And if you break a leg in the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

285
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point is they don't have </v>

286
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the luxury of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

287
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:05.041
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:08.010
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention to in crossfit I </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped a barbell on my foot.</v>

289
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the doctor.</v>

290
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm out for a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a big deal.</v>

291
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shorter life though.</v>

292
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like nearly as fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be.</v>

293
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.340
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing is that in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that it's actually more fun because</v>

294
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they have such a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

295
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what we don't have.</v>

296
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.523
<v Speaker 1>And obviously part of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating with your podcast and what </v>

297
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to create on a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>level with our podcasts is tribe,</v>

298
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

299
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong sense of community,</v>

300
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a group of people that you belong with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.180
<v Speaker 1>you're in it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that sort of stuff.</v>

302
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

303
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And he particularly talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly,</v>

304
00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:45.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about what is the experience of</v>

305
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 1>the elderly in a tribe and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're super valuable until death.</v>

306
00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:49.494
<v Speaker 1>Everybody respects the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always have things to contribute to </v>

307
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:54.840
<v Speaker 1>a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do with the elderly here?</v>

308
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:58.170
<v Speaker 1>You stick them in a fucking old person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and leave him to rot.</v>

309
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that sense of belonging,</v>

310
00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:01.110
<v Speaker 1>that sense of purpose late in life.</v>

311
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.013
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a sheer volume thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost like we don't value life </v>

312
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:05.884
<v Speaker 2>as much because we're overwhelmed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we're talking about the last </v>

313
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>podcast about the number of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America today versus when I was a kid.</v>

314
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 14 there was.</v>

315
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 2>We figured there was 230 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

316
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred and $25 million.</v>

317
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a 100 million plus more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the sheer volume.</v>

318
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.313
<v Speaker 2>It seems like if we lived in a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>town and there was some guy that we </v>

319
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 2>really loved and he was starting to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd want to take care of them.</v>

320
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.743
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's like crazy asshole that's </v>

321
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 2>down the hallway in your apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

322
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:36.304
<v Speaker 2>you never even talked to that dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a thousand people in </v>

323
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 2>your apartment building that you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to.</v>

324
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

325
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.260
<v Speaker 1>part part of it is like what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological limits?</v>

326
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.293
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in general there's what's called the </v>

327
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar number and the Dunbar number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of the 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:50</v>

329
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>and then there are serious to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what that is for people who haven't</v>

330
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>heard of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple.</v>

331
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 1>The easiest way to understand it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

332
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you may have 4,000</v>

333
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:01.204
<v Speaker 1>friends on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you constantly find like who </v>

334
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the fuck are these people that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>friended?</v>

335
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And some sort of like friending for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

336
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 1>like a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

337
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Well hopefully not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you were breaking up.</v>

338
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

339
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>you find that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

340
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I only really know a few of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

341
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>the majority of them my brain can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

342
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you even get into that experience.</v>

343
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:24.484
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what I always find </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is you run into someone you </v>

344
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:26.974
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on the street and you're kind of </v>

345
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 1>avoiding the interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

346
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

347
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck do I know this guy from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And you also then if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really get into it,</v>

349
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>then you have to dust off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

350
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:42.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to invest time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking exhausting.</v>

351
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

352
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a real limit to like how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people any one human brain can handle.</v>

353
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it more of like the top nine on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>space?</v>

354
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't</v>

355
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 3>it nine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it nine people?</v>

356
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When were you to have a top nine?</v>

357
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:56.984
<v Speaker 3>And like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the people that you were like </v>

358
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 3>pretty tight with you to have your boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your friends and the top nine.</v>

359
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a series</v>

360
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

361
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:08.590
<v Speaker 1>there's essentially like two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are like,</v>

363
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you would tell anything to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

364
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And then there's sort of like your top </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

365
00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:13.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sort of like,</v>

366
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.760
<v Speaker 1>oh we're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can all go hang out.</v>

367
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to have a bachelor party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people I would invite.</v>

368
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

369
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:20.374
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of get out into larger and </v>

370
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:24.250
<v Speaker 1>larger circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 50 is sort of the size of a tribe,</v>

371
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's 1:50,</v>

372
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:27.700
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:28.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>

374
00:15:28.781 --> 00:15:29.591
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

375
00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:32.080
<v Speaker 1>people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd recognize their face,</v>

376
00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:34.330
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't totally fucking know you.</v>

377
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's a series of all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the numbers are,</v>

378
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not 7 billion.</v>

379
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 3>small towns is that there's a,</v>

380
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a feeling in small towns of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasion,</v>

381
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.990
<v Speaker 3>invasion of your privacy as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a feeling of comradery.</v>

382
00:15:55.991 --> 00:16:00.991
<v Speaker 3>There's also like a nosiness yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if there's 2000 people living in</v>

383
00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 3>an apartment building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to know shit about anybody.</v>

384
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

385
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>But if it's 2000 people living in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

386
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:11.050
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole town and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to know everything about everybody</v>

387
00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

388
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.553
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that hunter boy know what he's up </v>

389
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what about that Brian?</v>

390
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a wacky one.</v>

391
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.230
<v Speaker 3>And everybody wants to gossip and </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange information.</v>

392
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.480
<v Speaker 1>What gossip is what Dunbar his work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really about.</v>

393
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his big book is a grooming gossip and</v>

394
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the origins of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Dunbar,</v>

395
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:33.060
<v Speaker 1>his whole thesis is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big question has always been like,</v>

396
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:34.470
<v Speaker 1>why do we talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

397
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Like why do humans have language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the function of language?</v>

398
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.693
<v Speaker 1>And what Dunbar did was he basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at what's the natural group size </v>

399
00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:42.930
<v Speaker 1>of different primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

400
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:48.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural group size for a apes </v>
<v Speaker 1>for chimpanzees and you know,</v>

402
00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 1>orangutans and all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what ends up happening is,</v>

403
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:54.450
<v Speaker 1>is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're chimps,</v>

404
00:16:54.451 --> 00:16:54.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

405
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you can groom all the members of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>

406
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.350
<v Speaker 1>of your troop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.184
<v Speaker 1>That's not a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if your trip is 150 people like it </v>

408
00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:02.694
<v Speaker 1>is for humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can physically groom </v>

409
00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:08.910
<v Speaker 1>all of those people so it becomes too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people to physically groom.</v>

410
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.983
<v Speaker 1>So essentially the idea is that language</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how we groom each other without </v>

411
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:16.440
<v Speaker 1>having to do it physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gossip is about.</v>

412
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's really that we're like grooming </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

413
00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:19.944
<v Speaker 1>we're maintaining social relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're trading information about </v>

414
00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Speaker 1>who's trustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not trustworthy,</v>

415
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.813
<v Speaker 1>who did what to who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and passing information around in the </v>

416
00:17:29.401 --> 00:17:31.410
<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>

417
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.563
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems also when you think about how </v>

418
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 3>women are really into gossiping and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chatting,</v>

419
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 3>whereas men really appreciate quiet and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

420
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and then get upset if people are too </v>
<v Speaker 3>flashy young.</v>

421
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 3>It's about men going off into hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>

422
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the women's staying back and going,</v>

423
00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:48.424
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy motherfuckers doing when no </v>

424
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:49.944
<v Speaker 3>one's looking and they have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assess what the dangers are in their </v>

425
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:52.930
<v Speaker 3>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

426
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.323
<v Speaker 4>And specifically men like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying about like making sure that </v>

427
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 4>nobody's getting too flashy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

428
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

429
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 4>that's the real function of teasing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

430
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 4>The real function of teasing is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

431
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at these hunter gatherer </v>

432
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:06.324
<v Speaker 4>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have all these mechanisms for </v>

433
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 4>making sure that nobody's head gets too </v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

434
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

435
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do things where,</v>

436
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:13.764
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you my arrow and you'll go </v>

437
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 4>hunt with my arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then even if you kill a deer,</v>

438
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 4>it's actually not your kill because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was done with my arrow.</v>

439
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 4>It's everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's everybody's killed.</v>

440
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then also,</v>

441
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

442
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:28.164
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have all these rituals when </v>

443
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:29.904
<v Speaker 4>somebody is elected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big man of the tribe or whatever it </v>

444
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>

445
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Then all the group will get around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>make fun of him,</v>

446
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.623
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll sort of humiliate him and </v>

447
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:38.394
<v Speaker 4>it's a sort of democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way of keeping him his ego in </v>

448
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 4>check.</v>

449
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 3>So this is what Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoiding.</v>

450
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.790
<v Speaker 3>The exact this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's avoiding this inevitable reality of</v>

451
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 3>being mocked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mad at Alec Baldwin.</v>

452
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Well then he should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should embrace it.</v>

453
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the shit,</v>

454
00:18:55.391 --> 00:18:56.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should,</v>

455
00:18:56.231 --> 00:18:57.130
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

456
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.500
<v Speaker 4>that's if for his social function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

457
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:03.700
<v Speaker 4>the leaders social function is to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>humble because we,</v>

458
00:19:03.701 --> 00:19:05.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power corrupts,</v>

459
00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:06.820
<v Speaker 4>like that's what it does to human </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology.</v>

460
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:07.654
<v Speaker 4>That's not a function of Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a function of the human </v>

461
00:19:09.101 --> 00:19:09.934
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

462
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.051
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

463
00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:11.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

464
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:12.980
<v Speaker 4>we know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

465
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.751
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

466
00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:14.584
<v Speaker 4>that's been studied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a guy at a bar at a UC </v>

467
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.401
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dacher Keltner,</v>

468
00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:20.380
<v Speaker 4>who's also awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

469
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.530
<v Speaker 4>who's studied power and specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

470
00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:26.050
<v Speaker 4>there's this old quote from Lord Acton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power corrupts,</v>

471
00:19:26.051 --> 00:19:27.790
<v Speaker 4>absolute power corrupts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

472
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.773
<v Speaker 4>He went and studied that and he got more</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific and he found out that power </v>

473
00:19:31.301 --> 00:19:32.134
<v Speaker 4>does two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes people more impulsive and it </v>

474
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:37.030
<v Speaker 4>makes them less empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it makes people good,</v>

475
00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:37.864
<v Speaker 4>impulsive and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Impulsive in the sense that you'll have </v>

476
00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:43.330
<v Speaker 4>celebrities who will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm giving away all my fucking money.</v>

477
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

478
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was fucking dumb.</v>

479
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Or like Wesley Snipes had that great </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of like,</v>

480
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to not pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In his defense,</v>

481
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.413
<v Speaker 3>he just got one of those wacky attorney </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced there's some loophole in the </v>

482
00:19:57.211 --> 00:20:00.260
<v Speaker 3>constitution and they don't want this </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution loopholes.</v>

483
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

484
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 3>They found out that no one has to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taxes goes down.</v>

485
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.813
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that actually </v>

486
00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:10.614
<v Speaker 3>had that conversation with me telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't have to pay taxes and </v>

487
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:15.564
<v Speaker 3>that the constitution says that the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>time we were supposed to pay taxes is </v>

488
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:19.524
<v Speaker 3>during war and that's when they came up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with federal taxes in the first place </v>

489
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 3>and it's not legal and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really charge you with it.</v>

490
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>If you just resist like bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will put you in a cage,</v>

491
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 3>take all your money and we'll put you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cage.</v>

492
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.983
<v Speaker 3>Like it is a one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two really fascinating things </v>

493
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:36.324
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really fascinating one and </v>

494
00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't pay your taxes,</v>

495
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those debts were it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

496
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 3>You go to fucking jail like you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>

497
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 3>They take everything you have the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you have no ability to pay it.</v>

498
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 3>When you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still owe it and you go to jail.</v>

499
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>just pay it off.</v>

500
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.761
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

501
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 3>you owed $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in back taxes.</v>

502
00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:58.024
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking lied to us about paying </v>

503
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you go to jail.</v>

504
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Like you weren't honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just you owe the money,</v>

505
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.780
<v Speaker 3>now you pay it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're clean.</v>

506
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

507
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.681
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

508
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:06.514
<v Speaker 3>You go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take all your money and then you get </v>

509
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:09.664
<v Speaker 3>out and you hadn't made money in a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and now you've got to get back on </v>

510
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:12.740
<v Speaker 3>your feet and fuck you.</v>

511
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.223
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other time the PS fuck you is </v>

512
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:16.714
<v Speaker 3>student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one thing that you can't fucking go </v>

513
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.270
<v Speaker 3>bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wealth,</v>

514
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 3>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the worst idea ever.</v>

515
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:25.834
<v Speaker 3>Saddled down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young impulsive children who are just </v>

516
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 3>getting out of their parents' grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saddle them down with debt and then have</v>

517
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 3>them enter into a diminishing job </v>
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

518
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And if you start off something in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the fucking odds?</v>

519
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's tech related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that anything you learned is going to be</v>

520
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 3>applicable in four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

521
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university system,</v>

522
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:45.934
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.773
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ship that is sinking pretty </v>

524
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 3>damn fast and a whole lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

525
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.543
<v Speaker 3>Having Jordan Peterson on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys had them before I had them on </v>

526
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.830
<v Speaker 3>and I've been paying attention to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>work for a long time.</v>

527
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:59.683
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the few people that are out </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing out there in the river </v>

528
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:04.420
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

529
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's doing.</v>

530
00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

531
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>You guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is madness.</v>

532
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 3>You guys aren't being honest about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things here.</v>

533
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Did you see this recent thing with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>women's March?</v>

534
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.393
<v Speaker 3>It was in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're separating the women by color </v>

535
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.053
<v Speaker 3>and white women are being told to check </v>
<v Speaker 3>their privilege in this March against </v>

536
00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 3>discrimination and privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find that.</v>

537
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put that up on my twitter,</v>

538
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:28.474
<v Speaker 3>pulled it up because it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious and this is not some fringe </v>

539
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.253
<v Speaker 3>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This New York Times printing this and </v>

540
00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:35.374
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer posted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women's march on Washington opens </v>

541
00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 3>contentious dialogues about race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

542
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

543
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:42.994
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the headline that was on my </v>

544
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:47.370
<v Speaker 3>twitter thing about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the headlines Hilarious.</v>

545
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what schirmer said.</v>

546
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protest racism now,</v>

547
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 3>dividing women by skin color whites told</v>
<v Speaker 3>to check your privilege.</v>

548
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:57.723
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you were talking about </v>

549
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>with power and power corrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is power.</v>

550
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.933
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the thing that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this social justice warrior </v>

551
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:06.724
<v Speaker 3>movement is not just people deciding </v>
<v Speaker 3>that some people should be more ethical </v>

552
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:12.060
<v Speaker 3>or kind or loving or open a progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

553
00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

554
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.383
<v Speaker 3>It's exerting power over people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforce your standard of thinking and </v>

555
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.060
<v Speaker 3>driving on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant problem.</v>

556
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's what Jordan Peterson is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

557
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the power of a adjust cause,</v>

558
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

559
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 3>You're fighting racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting sexism.</v>

560
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Like these are things to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

561
00:23:30.121 --> 00:23:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm all down with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that you know,</v>

562
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have any problem with it,</v>

563
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson takes issue with some of</v>

564
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 3>that behavior there.</v>

565
00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.883
<v Speaker 3>Then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying racism and sexism and </v>

566
00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 3>discrimination are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

567
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 3>no one saying the stupid game that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

568
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:47.624
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to paint you into a corner </v>

569
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously with their opening </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement while you're a bigot.</v>

570
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

571
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's really going on?</v>

572
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Just because we disagree on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bigot.</v>

573
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

574
00:23:57.901 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

575
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 3>the argument I think particularly about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns,</v>

576
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 3>it really comes down to a linguistic one</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that,</v>

577
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>words are tools,</v>

578
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you look,</v>

579
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.014
<v Speaker 3>if you want to talk about pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at English and the time of </v>

580
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

581
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 3>They had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>

582
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.430
<v Speaker 3>thou right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was another pronoun and then they got</v>

583
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 3>the fuck rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

584
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And why did they get rid of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they were like,</v>

585
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 3>man doesn't really add anything good.</v>

586
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 3>When you say to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it sounds fancy,</v>

587
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't practically add anything.</v>

588
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

589
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.253
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing as the romance </v>

590
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 3>languages where it was a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between formal and informal,</v>

591
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:34.274
<v Speaker 3>you and essentially we decided we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>need that distinction so that Pronoun </v>

592
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:40.010
<v Speaker 3>dropped away and in general that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>has happened over time.</v>

593
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:40.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

594
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.953
<v Speaker 3>Joe Hendricks work is that language </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplifies over time the tools become </v>

595
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:50.501
<v Speaker 3>more and more powerful and more refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same way that say a stone tools,</v>

596
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the early stone tools,</v>

597
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 3>their shit and then over time they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more elegant and more refined.</v>

598
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.103
<v Speaker 3>The same thing as being happening with </v>
<v Speaker 3>language for the entirety of human </v>

599
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:01.250
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get whittled down.</v>

600
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 3>So what the fuck do you think happens if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you introduced 70 gender pronouns?</v>

601
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.673
<v Speaker 3>Well you might get equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking racist cisgendered piece of </v>

602
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Shit.</v>

603
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is for guys like us,</v>

604
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:15.824
<v Speaker 3>we have so much privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're going to be there like </v>

605
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 3>checking it in like half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour.</v>

606
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.410
<v Speaker 3>We have to even out the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>

607
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.583
<v Speaker 3>The world must be evened out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no more competition by the </v>

608
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:27.914
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the more hilarious </v>

609
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Speaker 3>things about people that actually think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're communist shut.</v>

610
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.653
<v Speaker 3>Just shut your fucking mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you are and you really do </v>

611
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 3>subscribe to that guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not contributing.</v>

612
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.890
<v Speaker 3>You're like one of those hippies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>always wants.</v>

613
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 3>We'd never bring some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

614
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's old shit about you bring your own</v>

615
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:46.820
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You they never have it.</v>

616
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the communist people,</v>

617
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 3>the people that are really into the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of communism on theory about everybody's</v>

618
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Speaker 3>sharing and not worrying about money.</v>

619
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 3>There'll be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only the three of us.</v>

620
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 3>We were the only people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my example that I always love to</v>

621
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:00.014
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If was the three of us and there was </v>

622
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>like $3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world and we all said,</v>

623
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all just split it up like.</v>

624
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.403
<v Speaker 3>And then money won't be nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just we'll just trade back and </v>

625
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 3>forth and everything should be even </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

626
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'd be fine with that.</v>

627
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:12.923
<v Speaker 3>And then we go on about our merry way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's too many fucking people and </v>

628
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.124
<v Speaker 3>there's inevitably going to be going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be some form of competition and it's </v>

629
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:19.544
<v Speaker 3>some form of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are going to get out ahead </v>

630
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.243
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be some people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are upset that people were ahead and </v>

631
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.673
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are going to be at the head </v>

632
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 3>because they're assholes.</v>

633
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Some people are going to be head because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get up at 5:00</v>

634
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:31.610
<v Speaker 3>in the morning while you sleep till </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking noon.</v>

635
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 3>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all true.</v>

636
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.203
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that are totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical and they just do a lot of work </v>

637
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>and they do better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to do better.</v>

638
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>They didn't steal from anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't rip anybody off.</v>

639
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.913
<v Speaker 3>But this narrative keeps getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated by people who don't get up at </v>

640
00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:46.464
<v Speaker 3>7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning or don't have the same </v>

641
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:48.744
<v Speaker 3>kind of ambition or feel bad because </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people do want a fucking private </v>

642
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 3>jet and fly all over the world and ball </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Dan Bilzerian.</v>

643
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's all these things are true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

644
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:01.900
<v Speaker 3>it's both things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can be an ethical person,</v>

645
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:02.743
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like a super ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy person and wants to succeed in </v>

646
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 3>business for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not mutually exclusive.</v>

647
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.243
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when everybody says capitalism is </v>

648
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 3>evil and it's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

649
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.881
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

650
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saying that it's a problem.</v>

651
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.083
<v Speaker 3>It's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole reason why you have a fucking </v>

652
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 3>laptop to complain on is because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism.</v>

653
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.993
<v Speaker 3>And the point is is that the lesson of </v>
<v Speaker 3>2016 is that there are a lot of shit </v>

654
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:25.164
<v Speaker 3>ideas out there and there shit ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>spread all around the political </v>

655
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

656
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.293
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the challenge of 2017 is how do </v>

657
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:32.904
<v Speaker 3>we kill those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also in the defense of the people </v>

658
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 3>that are anti corporate or Anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>Corporation,</v>

659
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 3>there is an issue when these gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups get together and they're only.</v>

660
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.960
<v Speaker 3>They're only motivation is acquiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>more money every year.</v>

661
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.873
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does become a problem and then </v>

662
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:48.684
<v Speaker 3>there's a diffusion of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're locked into that giant </v>

663
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:51.504
<v Speaker 3>system and you're just a middle manager </v>
<v Speaker 3>of some Exxon group that's fucking kill </v>

664
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 3>and seals and you don't give a shit.</v>

665
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those poor seals.</v>

666
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 3>What are they living in the Arctic </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway?</v>

667
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.513
<v Speaker 3>Loyalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid fucking seals covered up with </v>

668
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 3>soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

669
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.560
<v Speaker 3>it becomes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

670
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 3>It becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just a part of the thing.</v>

671
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a new BMW drives itself.</v>

672
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a house in the hamptons.</v>

673
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a problem too.</v>

674
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two problems.</v>

675
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's a million of them,</v>

676
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a problem with money too.</v>

677
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like it might be the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be corporations in itself might be</v>

678
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:29.220
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is a power thing.</v>

679
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Like you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolute power will look.</v>

680
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 3>The problem is not power per se,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unchecked power.</v>

681
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

682
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean the founding fathers understood </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

683
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 3>That's why you had checks and balances </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the problem is,</v>

684
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:43.380
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of the checks and balances</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

685
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals,</v>

686
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

687
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 3>What's happening at universities have </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken down,</v>

688
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the checks on corporations,</v>

689
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 3>which is government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

690
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.613
<v Speaker 3>is broken down and the check on </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is the people and that's </v>

691
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:55.734
<v Speaker 3>broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happened is in a lot of </v>

692
00:28:57.331 --> 00:28:58.164
<v Speaker 3>the checks and balances have failed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate check and balance is the </v>

693
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>

694
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.074
<v Speaker 3>is that you can't get the wisdom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowds if the crowd isn't wise and it's </v>

695
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:11.211
<v Speaker 3>not a real big fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One and so good statement.</v>

696
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>

697
00:29:12.581 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 3>is that a large part of this is these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are large historical forces,</v>

698
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 3>namely specialization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

699
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 3>if we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:21.570
<v Speaker 3>the 300 million people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that everybody's an idiot,</v>

701
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:22.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that,</v>

702
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a lawyer and you know the law and</v>

703
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 3>you know nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

704
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Or you are a teacher and you know your </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>

705
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:31.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

706
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

707
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:32.904
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you go into academia and you talk </v>

708
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 3>to a bunch of scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find,</v>

709
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:36.991
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:41.991
<v Speaker 3>your sub discipline of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of biology and chemistry of and</v>

711
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 1>literally nothing else that is happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>in science.</v>

712
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what that happens is if you look</v>

713
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>at the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

714
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:51.340
<v Speaker 1>they read really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really widely.</v>

715
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

716
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.523
<v Speaker 1>I was recently involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dispute with some </v>

717
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

718
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.443
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to libertarianism.org</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's just run by the Cato </v>

719
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.583
<v Speaker 1>Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the intellectual dispute </v>

720
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:04.024
<v Speaker 1>regarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my big beef that I've been taking is </v>

721
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 1>with fundamentalists and across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>

722
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have a car.</v>

723
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist you are.</v>

724
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I have an issue with fundamentalism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general and if you look at what you were</v>

725
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 1>just doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

726
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>is that you were able to hold two </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory thoughts in your mind.</v>

727
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

728
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.343
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to say there's a problem </v>

729
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:26.614
<v Speaker 1>with people who oppose capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with much of what </v>

730
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>corporations are doing.</v>

731
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.173
<v Speaker 1>And then that's how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to figure out reality is </v>

732
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

733
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 1>there are these two opposing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I reconcile them?</v>

734
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And you have to go around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think,</v>

735
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to talk to people,</v>

736
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:41.764
<v Speaker 1>you have to do all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentalists aren't burdened with </v>

737
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:44.584
<v Speaker 1>that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a much easier time because </v>

738
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:48.124
<v Speaker 1>they know that they are the good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that there is one thing that </v>

739
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:52.024
<v Speaker 1>is the answer to all of our problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is one thing that is bad and </v>

740
00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 1>whatever that bad thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can just get rid of that bad thing.</v>

741
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:00.064
<v Speaker 1>Then all of our problems will be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go about figuring out how </v>

742
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 1>to strip away more and more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad thing.</v>

743
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.083
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at the obvious example is </v>

744
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism.</v>

745
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the way of the profit.</v>

746
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 1>We just have to live the way of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prophet Mohammed.</v>

747
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>And so then we have to strip out </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that interferes with that,</v>

748
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>like toothbrushes and kites and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

749
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.113
<v Speaker 1>women's education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're driving around all these really </v>

750
00:31:25.631 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 1>problematic things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

751
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.143
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that the prophet Mohammed </v>

752
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:30.094
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a toothbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a stick toothbrush and you </v>

753
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a dentist,</v>

754
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think that an oral b is better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a stick toothbrush.</v>

755
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.001
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

756
00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:40.240
<v Speaker 1>they had like sticks that were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bristled at the end or something.</v>

757
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:41.074
<v Speaker 1>Like they would break up the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you just get that stick in there </v>

758
00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:44.294
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.600
<v Speaker 1>So you're supposed to use that today to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>

760
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to some of Moms,</v>

761
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

762
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super deep.</v>

763
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

764
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.653
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point that it's always about </v>

765
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>going super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super deep.</v>

766
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not the case with Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all religions,</v>

767
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:57.784
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

768
00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.460
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500
<v Speaker 3>kind of like casual Christians just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

770
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 3>People that are casual Muslims and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that go whole hog.</v>

771
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the reckoning is coming.</v>

772
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.973
<v Speaker 3>Jesus is on his way and that's better </v>
<v Speaker 3>pack your bags because you're going to </v>

773
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:12.334
<v Speaker 3>need clothes and having people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>packed and ready for Jesus to take them </v>

774
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:16.100
<v Speaker 3>away</v>

775
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.000
<v Speaker 1>and those people give the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity or the rest of Islam.</v>

776
00:32:20.001 --> 00:32:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

777
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.043
<v Speaker 3>bad name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also give us amazing movies </v>

778
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.630
<v Speaker 3>left behind and left behind too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've seen them,</v>

779
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.300
<v Speaker 3>but they're Kirk Cameron's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

780
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 3>a ratable work of comedy that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know his comedy while he was making.</v>

781
00:32:36.141 --> 00:32:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so bad.</v>

782
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left behind and left behind too.</v>

783
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought it on vhs.</v>

784
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I saw it at Walmart and I snatched it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a greet each child.</v>

785
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left,</v>

786
00:32:48.491 --> 00:32:49.324
<v Speaker 3>right and left behind too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can probably get it on </v>

787
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.393
<v Speaker 3>itunes or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on itunes or Netflix and find out </v>

788
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:58.250
<v Speaker 3>where people can watch it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking unbelievably bad.</v>

789
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.663
<v Speaker 3>Somebody a youtube Amazon video or </v>
<v Speaker 3>google play and it was based on these </v>

790
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic books that were written by </v>
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this fucking shit bag.</v>

795
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 3>It's so dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing.</v>

796
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two guys.</v>

797
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Two guys can each other off in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made that up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Gay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a.</v>

803
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:42.014
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to never forget some of Kirk </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cameron's best work that growing pains </v>

804
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 3>as best work is avoiding Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

807
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:52.820

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

808
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:53.654
<v Speaker 3>This is for the cinematography and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that this is made in 2000 and </v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You really shouldn't be bananas Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wouldn't that be amazing if you </v>

825

<v Speaker 3>managed to convince Christians that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

826
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually instead of the Eucharist,</v>

827
00:34:41.421 --> 00:34:42.254
<v Speaker 3>you should be eating bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people that believe bananas are </v>

828
00:34:44.861 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 3>like super good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then your potassium,</v>

829

<v Speaker 3>there's something to them but the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconuts better for you and you got to </v>

830
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:50.144
<v Speaker 3>break that fucking thing open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get through that husk like </v>

831
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 3>somebody had to figure out that husk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 3>And then the hard part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be so hungry.</v>

833
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.263
<v Speaker 3>You're banging on a brock and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily for you there's meat and water </v>

834
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wow,</v>

835
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to do a lot of work.</v>

836
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I bet it was probably somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>loved.</v>

837
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:10.964
<v Speaker 3>One was killed by a falling coconut and </v>
<v Speaker 3>got fucking pissed as smashed that </v>

838
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:19.661
<v Speaker 3>coconut with a rock thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut and killed their mom or somebody</v>

839
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 3>who killed their mom with that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut.</v>

840
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.693
<v Speaker 3>That to 150.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People die every year because coconuts </v>

841
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 3>fall in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a way to go.</v>

842
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Twenty one people in America are killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by armed toddlers every year.</v>

843
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.163
<v Speaker 3>I think I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you rather go buy coconut or </v>

844
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:35.444
<v Speaker 3>toddler coconut all day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll God dropping a rock on my head all </v>

845
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 3>day to be in shot by a one year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A one year old.</v>

846
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 3>You like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean?</v>

847
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:46.764
<v Speaker 3>I know you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you leave a loaded gun in your </v>

848
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:50.740
<v Speaker 3>purse and crazy bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

849
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.450
<v Speaker 3>you get mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernice,</v>

850
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should fucking keep that gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your hip.</v>

851
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They leave guns and purses and they </v>

852
00:35:58.091 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 3>leave the kids with the guns and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids pull it.</v>

853
00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.873
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see now on TV and they shoot mommy 21 </v>

854
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>

855
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in general,</v>

856
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's two a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

857
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One just probably happened right now.</v>

858
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a timer that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>off like we're waiting.</v>

859
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like the slowest national debt </v>
<v Speaker 3>clock.</v>

860
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.133
<v Speaker 3>We should have a arm toddler where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a notification every time an rm </v>

861
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 3>toddler kills a person because it's 21 a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year just in this country.</v>

862
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.703
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think probably primarily in this </v>

863
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:37.050
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Folks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

869
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 3>1:13</v>
<v Speaker 3>says they killed more.</v>

870
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God is so that's 13 had </v>
<v Speaker 3>inadvertently killed themselves.</v>

871
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:01.973
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 kids had killed themselves with </v>

872
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 3>firearms.</v>

873
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:08.140
<v Speaker 3>13 more injured themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 injured other people and to killed.</v>

874
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's only two.</v>

875
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 3>This is this statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was looking up.</v>

876
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 3>The toddlers killed more Americans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists in 2015.</v>

877
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.000
<v Speaker 3>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many do they kill?</v>

878
00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.253
<v Speaker 3>It says they only killed two to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed other people to killed other </v>

879
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So toddlers,</v>

880
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 3>they were suicide bombers who killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

881
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 3>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

882
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 3>so when you're saying that they killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>15 people,</v>

883
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.070
<v Speaker 3>13 of those 15 were the baby themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not the same.</v>

885
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not that,</v>

886
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 3>but I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is this?</v>

887
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Where are you getting this from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On snopes.</v>

888
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>I just typed indoor arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toddlers.</v>

889
00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't we talk about snobs?</v>

890
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.730
<v Speaker 3>About the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy Married a hooker?</v>

891
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

892
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 3>The guy who owned snopes left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife,</v>

893
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.853
<v Speaker 3>married a hooker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a who had a website that's an act of </v>

894
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.040
<v Speaker 3>escort website with reviews as recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>as 2015 people reviewing.</v>

895
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 3>So nothing wrong with being a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

896
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.190
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the oldest profession,</v>

897
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 3>but when I think about a dude marrying a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hooker,</v>

898
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I figured about a dude who's off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rails.</v>

899
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 3>When you think about a dude in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties who marries an escort,</v>

900
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:12.511
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

901
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.344
<v Speaker 3>he might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a 50 slash 50 chance that guy </v>

902
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:16.404
<v Speaker 3>might be out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like one of the criticisms of snopes </v>

903
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:20.874
<v Speaker 3>during this election was that it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a pro hillary bias to some of </v>

904
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the information that snopes was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reporting on and apparently she had been</v>

905
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:33.681
<v Speaker 3>involved in some sort of an anti Bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti anti Republican website in the past</v>

906
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leans left the whole deal,</v>

907
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.440
<v Speaker 3>so snobs might be a little wacky or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe beside all those things,</v>

908
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:48.130
<v Speaker 3>they still stick to the science thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

909
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't that be nice if people actually</v>

910
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 3>stuck to the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facts,</v>

911
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

912
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.613
<v Speaker 3>I would way rather have someone who goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and married some crazy escort lady </v>

913
00:38:56.531 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 3>and they pull up to ecstasy every night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes down to the work,</v>

914
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 3>they do solid works because I'm a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

915
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.393
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was all her husband and wife now </v>

916
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 3>married and that's the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

917
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Happy couple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they have a good time.</v>

918
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 3>The guy smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives a shit if she got paid for sex,</v>

919
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>people are so god damn prudish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when she was at our best.</v>

920
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.743
<v Speaker 3>But presumably it's also like the weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing always with fundamentalists and </v>

921
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:24.664
<v Speaker 3>like wanting to marry a virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't you want somebody who has </v>

922
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 3>some experience with the old wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

923
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.110
<v Speaker 3>She's mad dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

924
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.670
<v Speaker 3>she mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be like a meme just as.</v>

925
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

926
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.561
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

927
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 3>you'd want someone who was experienced </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

928
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.373
<v Speaker 3>You want someone who's worked at all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>toothy blow jobs so that when they get </v>

929
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're doing.</v>

930
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.693
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is there much of a difference </v>

931
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:47.284
<v Speaker 3>between a woman who gets paid for each </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual sexual encounter versus a </v>

932
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:53.640
<v Speaker 3>woman who marries a guy for money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty much same thing.</v>

933
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:55.000
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

934
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you just have one John for life </v>

935
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.850
<v Speaker 3>or at least until you run out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

936
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Until the Castillo's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

937
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Until they upgrade seat number for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys like that's a,</v>

938
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.530
<v Speaker 3>that's the trump move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

939
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.403
<v Speaker 3>those super rich dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they keep getting smaller and more </v>

940
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 3>baller or wife's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new one is like God damn.</v>

941
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Little bit at a certain point like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

942
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 3>He can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't replace Melania.</v>

943
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 3>Not while he's president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

944
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 3>with a hotter one.</v>

945
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

946
00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you can fuck,</v>

947
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

948
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:27.364
<v Speaker 3>He's the king of dance halls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people have come out of the </v>

949
00:40:30.221 --> 00:40:32.270
<v Speaker 3>closet as assholes now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

950
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a rare time where it's not just </v>

951
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:36.964
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't represent a lot of people that </v>

952
00:40:38.621 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 3>wanted to lean more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

953
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:43.750
<v Speaker 3>And you're also represents a lot of men </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are kind of dicks.</v>

954
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

955
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they get excited about this.</v>

956
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:48.080
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

957
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely more overt asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior in the name of trump.</v>

958
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:54.671
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

959
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 3>like he's tapped into that vein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't really see.</v>

960
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember seeing that from any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other candidate ever.</v>

961
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

962
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:03.491
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:07.070
<v Speaker 3>that frustration has been building a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time with those guys.</v>

964
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get that representation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get kicked his wife out.</v>

965
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 3>If she said something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

966
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of his breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

967
00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he kicks it to the curb and I mean,</v>

968
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.670
<v Speaker 3>people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of her donald.</v>

969
00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:22.504
<v Speaker 3>Get a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

970
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.403
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nationwide woman hunt to find the </v>

971
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:31.531
<v Speaker 3>perfect person who just knows to do what</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's told and to just to,</v>

972
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>just to obey the and just</v>

973
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 1>to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as she doesn't look too much</v>

974
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 1>like Ivanka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

975
00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Just got to look hot as fuck for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

976
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:42.014
<v Speaker 1>he's the God damn president of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and his wife is hot as </v>

977
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go down.</v>

978
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to get a less.</v>

979
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:50.030
<v Speaker 1>He's only going to go down in age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

980
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 1>because he keeps going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

981
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>He went with his first wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then with Marla Maples,</v>

982
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.153
<v Speaker 1>maples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was super hot and then this one is </v>

983
00:41:57.111 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 1>even more super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's off the charts.</v>

984
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern European women.</v>

985
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that all about?</v>

986
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

987
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I think actually like a large part of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I think also cultural,</v>

988
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.803
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain like arrogance that </v>

989
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:12.800
<v Speaker 1>eastern European women have where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of like,</v>

990
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

991
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 1>are you good enough for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain hottiness right.</v>

992
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And a certain skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an unavailability emotionally.</v>

993
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Are you a racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you know?</v>

994
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about generalist.</v>

995
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm speaking about culture.</v>

996
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 1>This is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

997
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations?</v>

998
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

999
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like a guy who likes them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1000
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1002
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's because of the war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those Russian men died in the </v>

1003
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1004
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a mass calling of males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1005
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much older phenomenon than the war.</v>

1006
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of cultural evolution,</v>

1007
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 1>the way that cultural evolution works is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have certain mindsets,</v>

1008
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:53.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every human has optimism and </v>

1009
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 1>pessimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1010
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 1>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about Americans earlier,</v>

1011
00:42:57.951 --> 00:42:58.784
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how outsiders see Americans and </v>

1012
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Americans are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1013
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:02.114
<v Speaker 1>historically massively optimistic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even Alexis de Tocqueville when he came </v>

1014
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:06.050
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1015
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 1>A French guy comes here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1016
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Americans are so optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is up with that?</v>

1017
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we kicked ass on.</v>

1018
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

1019
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1020
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 1>because their optimism has certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>

1021
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 1>which is that it makes you super </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

1022
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super happy.</v>

1023
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And these have always been a large part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what American success is about,</v>

1024
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.843
<v Speaker 1>but optimism doesn't have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an optimism has a tendency to </v>

1025
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:30.710
<v Speaker 1>make you delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1026
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

1027
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.823
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at what is the most </v>

1028
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:38.180
<v Speaker 1>optimistic group of humans on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1029
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.550
<v Speaker 1>it's actors in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1030
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Are they really the most optimistic you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>

1031
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:44.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who are to move to </v>

1032
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1033
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to really believe that out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people in the world that somehow</v>

1034
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make it.</v>

1035
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.783
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So optimism is what attracts people out </v>

1036
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:55.694
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens is that a lot of </v>

1037
00:43:57.381 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 1>them end up sort of sitting in optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1038
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>They're always sitting there and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1039
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get discovered.</v>

1040
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1041
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:05.234
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that sort of mindset and then </v>

1042
00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>they're just waiting for things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1043
00:44:08.391 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't have an actual plan for going</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1044
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.280
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously not true of all actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are like,</v>

1045
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1046
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm out here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to make it,</v>

1047
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I need to hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do things,</v>

1048
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:18.314
<v Speaker 1>I need to do all that sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is that trajectory for actors </v>

1049
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:23.300
<v Speaker 1>who come out here hoping they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get discovered,</v>

1050
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are waiting to be discovered for 40,</v>

1051
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:27.980
<v Speaker 1>50 years and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1052
00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they crash and then,</v>

1053
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become the super depressed,</v>

1054
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 1>cynical actors who sit around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1055
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck the industry.</v>

1056
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:38.590
<v Speaker 1>The industry is the fucking worst.</v>

1057
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people are rough to be around.</v>

1058
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 1>They are rough to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just spit it out.</v>

1059
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:46.404
<v Speaker 1>It's all negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like coming out of them like a </v>

1060
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:48.444
<v Speaker 1>sprinkler system and that is where a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of middle America is right now because </v>

1061
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 1>they've had this hope of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

1062
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 1>the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American dream,</v>

1063
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

1064
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 1>those hopes have been crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1065
00:44:58.981 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't panned out the way that it was</v>

1066
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:02.214
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're seeing a lot of pessimism </v>

1067
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite side.</v>

1068
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And pessimism has certain strengths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the strengths of pessimism.</v>

1069
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:11.064
<v Speaker 1>It's that constructive paranoia we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about that they practice in Papa </v>

1070
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.143
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're super alive to </v>

1071
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:16.674
<v Speaker 1>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're actually so alive to threats </v>

1072
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that you see threats that aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1073
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're paranoid,</v>

1074
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1075
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is,</v>

1076
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 1>is that it also comes with substance </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

1077
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you find that,</v>

1078
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1079
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:29.454
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in middle America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of substance abuse going </v>

1080
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all of these opioid addictions,</v>

1081
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1082
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that's a function of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being exposed to those things as much as</v>

1083
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:39.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a function of the society that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in,</v>

1084
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.660
<v Speaker 1>it's those things are super dangerous to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be exposed to.</v>

1085
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And because of these corporations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

1086
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 1>the concept want to up their bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

1087
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 1>they're selling these things and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on doctor.</v>

1088
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1089
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 1>that could be as much as the cause of </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair as a symptom of the issue.</v>

1090
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:57.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1091
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.060
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's a factor.</v>

1092
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Russia right?</v>

1093
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Russia is a place that is famous for </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance abuse,</v>

1094
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1095
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.013
<v Speaker 1>Thirty point five percent of Russians </v>
<v Speaker 1>die from alcohol related causes and </v>

1096
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 1>that's as compared to say three percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

1097
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 10 times as many Russians are dying </v>

1098
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 1>from alcohol related causes and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>drank fucking anything,</v>

1099
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:20.064
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they pioneer weird fucking drugs </v>

1100
00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 1>like Krokodil that are just like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>gnarly.</v>

1101
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It's either exposed bones and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there periodically.</v>

1102
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:32.190
<v Speaker 1>There's all this weird stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in Russia where,</v>

1103
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll drink like,</v>

1104
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird detergent,</v>

1105
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:36.924
<v Speaker 1>some glade plug in or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because there's a tiny bit of </v>

1106
00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:39.970
<v Speaker 1>alcohol in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1107
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.333
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain psychology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes with that massive pessimism and </v>

1108
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 1>that massive pessimism evolve because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context of Russian history,</v>

1109
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Russian history,</v>

1110
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:53.730
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to truly be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just read some Russian history,</v>

1111
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll do it for you.</v>

1112
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 1>And you find that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1113
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Russia has always been a meat grinder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1114
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It just chews people up and spits them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1115
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that you survive in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is being massively paranoid,</v>

1116
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The winter will kill you,</v>

1117
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leadership will kill you.</v>

1118
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 1>There all sorts of things that will kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1119
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the Eastern European mindset </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends towards this massive,</v>

1120
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:15.444
<v Speaker 1>massive pessimism and the pessimism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful in the same way that it is for </v>

1121
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:19.044
<v Speaker 1>the Papa New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian's where you're massively alive to </v>

1122
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:21.264
<v Speaker 1>possible threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sets up these problems and the </v>

1123
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.550
<v Speaker 1>problems that it sets up our substance </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

1124
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.683
<v Speaker 1>And it also sets up the problem of sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anticipating threats that aren't </v>

1125
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>actually there and just overall despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1126
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.793
<v Speaker 1>And so what ends up happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's then the problem that </v>

1127
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 1>pessimists and optimists misunderstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

1128
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get each other right.</v>

1129
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.293
<v Speaker 1>The optimist is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just fucking depressing and you </v>

1130
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.044
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of see threats that aren't there </v>

1131
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life sucks and the pessimists looks</v>

1132
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>at the optimists and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking delusional dude.</v>

1133
00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to get real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to understand how things </v>

1134
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:55.924
<v Speaker 1>really work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at what happens in </v>

1135
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:58.204
<v Speaker 1>Russian and American relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you'll have to the </v>

1136
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:04.090
<v Speaker 1>same situation but interpreted in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different ways.</v>

1137
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.223
<v Speaker 1>So after the fall of the Berlin Wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States made some sort of </v>

1138
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:09.394
<v Speaker 1>promise or some sort of intimation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would not expand NATO any further </v>

1139
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 1>east and the Russians were took that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1140
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not expanding NATO any further </v>
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>

1141
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in fact,</v>

1142
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 1>what ended up happening is the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and the West,</v>

1143
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of oblivious hopefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1144
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>let's keep expanding NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1145
00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 1>They didn't take this comment very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

1146
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.303
<v Speaker 1>and they moved NATO all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Estonia all the way to the Russian </v>

1147
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:33.724
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the Russian sitting on their site </v>

1148
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 1>interpret that as a violation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>

1149
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So sitting there as the pessimists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1150
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:41.500
<v Speaker 1>they're tracking each of these moves.</v>

1151
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:41.941
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1152
00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving to another country over.</v>

1153
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.480
<v Speaker 1>You're moving in another country over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see what you're doing.</v>

1154
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.343
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of what the tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>that boiled up between Russia and </v>

1155
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 1>America was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1156
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:52.804
<v Speaker 1>don't you think right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rushes in the weirdest place ever with </v>

1157
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Putin because he's essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictator is a dictator,</v>

1158
00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.853
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right out in front of you as a dictator </v>

1159
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and all of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the people that are opposing him,</v>

1160
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 1>they weren't getting murdered really </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly yet,</v>

1161
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but that's because the dictators are </v>
<v Speaker 1>godfathers.</v>

1162
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

1163
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.800
<v Speaker 1>father's household well on the sentiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russian culture that.</v>

1165
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:18.634
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to dictators in general who is </v>

1166
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Kadafi?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is Saddam Hussein?</v>

1167
00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Who are any of these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1168
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they functioned as the godfather of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their society.</v>

1169
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 1>So there's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you want the,</v>

1170
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 1>there's an I should clarify just so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know.</v>

1171
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:31.654
<v Speaker 1>Where is this all coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all coming from books and </v>

1172
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:35.860
<v Speaker 1>interviewing academics and if you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious about anything,</v>

1173
00:49:35.861 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>tweet me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

1174
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And if there's any comments that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious about,</v>

1175
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:40.774
<v Speaker 1>I'll direct you to the book and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go read it and you can work your way up </v>

1176
00:49:42.641 --> 00:49:43.474
<v Speaker 1>the science chain and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an onslaught of Dick pics to be </v>

1177
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 1>tweeted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1178
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Dick Pics.</v>

1179
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'll do with those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1180
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Speaker 1>when you want to send them back for </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifting.</v>

1181
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a Russian civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were we?</v>

1182
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:04.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

1183
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 1>there's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>

1184
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 1>if we talk about those hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1185
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>They have a two big problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1186
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.000
<v Speaker 1>One big problem is band level genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what'll happen is,</v>

1187
00:50:15.001 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 1>is that periodically one tribal just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wipe the other fucking tribe out,</v>

1188
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll kill them down to the last man,</v>

1189
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll kill the babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do all that sort of stuff.</v>

1190
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And this can happen super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super quickly.</v>

1191
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.300
<v Speaker 1>So what'll jared diamond when we had him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast,</v>

1192
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 1>he told this great story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 1>there's these two tribes in Papa New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea.</v>

1194
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 1>They've been living side by side for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years and years,</v>

1195
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 1>perfectly happily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love each other,</v>

1196
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 1>they get along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cooperate,</v>

1197
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 1>all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then resources get scarce,</v>

1198
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some change in the environment.</v>

1199
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there's not as much food around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as people start to get hungry,</v>

1200
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the tribes goes off and for in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of half an hour,</v>

1201
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:55.123
<v Speaker 1>they tell each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up stories that get increasingly </v>

1202
00:50:56.811 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 1>fantastic and by the end of the half an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour they have convinced themselves that</v>

1203
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 1>the other tribe are vermin that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be exterminated,</v>

1204
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.633
<v Speaker 1>that they are a scourge on the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not really human and they </v>

1205
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 1>go and wipe them the fuck out.</v>

1206
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.213
<v Speaker 1>And that is one of the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentials in human psychology is the </v>

1207
00:51:12.891 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 1>fact that when resources get scared </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarce,</v>

1208
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 1>we like identify some sort of threat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

1209
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.600
<v Speaker 1>some sort of group of humans and we go </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

1210
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>we wipe them the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>

1211
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Germany in 1933,</v>

1212
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the great depression,</v>

1213
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:28.094
<v Speaker 1>there's hyperinflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all these problems and you </v>

1214
00:51:30.231 --> 00:51:31.064
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old psychology that hasn't changed </v>

1215
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 1>and tens of thousands of years is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1216
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:36.613
<v Speaker 1>And so naturally people start looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for a scapegoat and the </v>

1217
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 1>antisemitism that is sort of already </v>
<v Speaker 1>lingering in.</v>

1218
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German cultural environment,</v>

1219
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly that becomes the target group </v>

1220
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

1221
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 1>the political opportunist comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

1222
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can blame it on them.</v>

1223
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.753
<v Speaker 1>That's the source of all your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's a death mode </v>

1224
00:51:55.221 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 1>locked in the human consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when things get scared and like,</v>

1225
00:51:58.341 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might die,</v>

1226
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 1>we're now on death mode.</v>

1227
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.813
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death mode means you kill other people </v>

1228
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1229
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1230
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 1>and you have to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1231
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:11.660
<v Speaker 1>this is the brutal reality of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in that hunter gatherer context,</v>

1232
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful if,</v>

1233
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 1>if resources get scarce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the one who acts first,</v>

1234
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.913
<v Speaker 1>who wipes out the other tribe first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting that we even think </v>

1235
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that this is unusual or bizarre when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at nature,</v>

1236
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 1>when you look at all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in nature that are set up,</v>

1237
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:32.981
<v Speaker 1>like how many times lions will kill cubs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that those males don't grow</v>

1238
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 1>up to dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1239
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Especially cubs that aren't theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1240
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.901
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1241
00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:39.734
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem of sort of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on college campuses is that </v>

1242
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:43.004
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of unpleasant things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human psychology and unpleasant things </v>

1243
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 1>in human nature and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for humanity,</v>

1244
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 1>really the good things come from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>

1245
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 1>When we're realistic about how disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

1246
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>we get to control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're realistic about how electrons</v>

1247
00:52:57.651 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to control them.</v>

1248
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is really important to this</v>

1249
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue with Marxism spreading across</v>

1250
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:08.840
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the cause of that?</v>

1251
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that so attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

1252
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Why are people so confident to openly </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaim,</v>

1253
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>proclaim themselves as Marxists without </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how ridiculous that is?</v>

1254
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1255
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so John Height,</v>

1256
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:21.970
<v Speaker 1>who um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at Nyu,</v>

1258
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.093
<v Speaker 1>he has what's called moral foundations </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and essentially it's that we </v>

1259
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have these sort of basic impulses</v>

1260
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 1>of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1261
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 1>fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1262
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.573
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch little kids and they're </v>

1263
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 1>like our tracking fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's fair,</v>

1264
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.384
<v Speaker 1>who got more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got to play with the toy more and </v>

1265
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:41.634
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

1266
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1267
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.213
<v Speaker 1>But we have these notions of fairness </v>
<v Speaker 1>play out in different ways as we're </v>

1268
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:47.364
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but different political groups and </v>

1269
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:50.994
<v Speaker 1>different tribes favor these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of fairness more than some </v>

1270
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take for example,</v>

1271
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the issue of pro life versus pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1272
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

1273
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the question.</v>

1274
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Are liberals pro life or are liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro choice?</v>

1275
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 1>They're more pro choice on the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>

1276
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>So on abortion it's about freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1277
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1278
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.170
<v Speaker 1>well it's very much about women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

1279
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.850
<v Speaker 1>women's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>

1280
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1281
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not even thought of it like as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human freedom because,</v>

1282
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:22.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1283
00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 1>it's about the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about the child.</v>

1284
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's about the woman's freedom,</v>

1285
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:27.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've hooked up to that idea of </v>

1286
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:29.730
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1287
00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1288
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are pro life.</v>

1289
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 1>This is about caring and protecting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>harm and all that sort of stuff.</v>

1290
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're talking about war,</v>

1291
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.410
<v Speaker 1>unless you're talking about war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the point.</v>

1292
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:41.244
<v Speaker 1>Is this that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all humans hypocrites or is it that </v>

1293
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:48.810
<v Speaker 1>we selectively use these same intuitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all have for different causes?</v>

1294
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1295
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 1>gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are liberals pro choice or pro life?</v>

1296
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely pro life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah Ha.</v>

1297
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.693
<v Speaker 1>So what you see is that on abortion </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pro choice and on gun control </v>

1298
00:54:59.851 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 1>they're pro life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when it comes the other way,</v>

1299
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:07.191
<v Speaker 1>exactly lichens are pro choice when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to guns.</v>

1300
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:08.933
<v Speaker 1>So we all have these same intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we use them in different ways to </v>

1301
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:14.130
<v Speaker 1>justify our political arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1302
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:14.964
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting too is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>two positions that are taking place in </v>

1303
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 1>the American psyche at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were almost reluctantly agreeing to</v>

1304
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.840
<v Speaker 1>and is that the Republicans are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Conservatives are more realistic,</v>

1305
00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 1>more hardcore ready to kick ass ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for what's right.</v>

1306
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas liberals are bunch of whiny </v>

1307
00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:35.514
<v Speaker 1>crybabies looking to give away their </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and they're creating welfare </v>

1308
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:38.701
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1309
00:55:38.701 --> 00:55:40.610
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for.</v>

1310
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.513
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking people would be speaking </v>

1311
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>German living in Vietnam actually write </v>
<v Speaker 1>well at all tribes.</v>

1312
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>The nature of tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell something that makes your tribe</v>

1313
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:52.280
<v Speaker 1>look like the good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1314
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So each tribe has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1315
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the conservative story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the liberal story is like we're</v>

1316
00:55:57.151 --> 00:56:00.810
<v Speaker 1>fighting racism and sexism because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the Golden Globes.</v>

1317
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see the golden.</v>

1318
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.780
<v Speaker 1>She's a meryl streep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep's speech.</v>

1319
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.850
<v Speaker 1>God bless her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless marrow.</v>

1320
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 1>What she was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts people get so mad.</v>

1321
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course she doesn't watch cage fighter</v>

1322
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 1>when she's talking out of her ass for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1323
00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 1>But she did say that some people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

1324
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:19.583
<v Speaker 1>Martial artists aren't artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's completely open to </v>

1325
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think is</v>

1326
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 3>beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that fucking stupid movie.</v>

1327
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 3>When you played that Rockstar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that one that nobody went to?</v>

1328
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 3>St Ricky get your gun or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that is.</v>

1329
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't art.</v>

1330
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.993
<v Speaker 3>That was an art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Anderson Silva Front kick to the </v>

1331
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:36.664
<v Speaker 3>face is a thousand times more beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that piece of shit movie put out </v>

1332
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:40.294
<v Speaker 3>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she's a very nice person and </v>

1333
00:56:43.351 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 3>she probably thinks that she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's standing up for what's right.</v>

1334
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Get ready for ricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ricky flash.</v>

1335
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.153
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three people saw that when we are all </v>

1336
00:56:53.111 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 3>related to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He saw that movie and you see that movie</v>

1337
00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 3>even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1338
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.810
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an 80 year old lady,</v>

1339
00:57:00.811 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 3>is going to be a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ricky's coming back.</v>

1340
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:03.694
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like such weird casting </v>

1341
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 3>for her too because she does like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally difficult.</v>

1342
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.913
<v Speaker 3>Like Sophie's choice movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like trying to do like a poppy </v>

1343
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.470
<v Speaker 3>rockstar movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she was interested in it.</v>

1344
00:57:13.471 --> 00:57:15.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's an amazing actress.</v>

1345
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.770
<v Speaker 3>She's an amazing artist in her realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just think it's the.</v>

1346
00:57:19.771 --> 00:57:20.604
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could sort of say that without </v>

1347
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.373
<v Speaker 3>disparaging what other people enjoy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>including disparaging with a lot of </v>

1348
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy like and foreigners.</v>

1349
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:30.303
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you were saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Hollywood is crawling with </v>

1350
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 3>foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take them out,</v>

1351
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:36.970
<v Speaker 3>all you have left is mma and football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA,</v>

1352
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the arts,</v>

1353
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.693
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true because like 80 percent </v>

1354
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:43.960
<v Speaker 3>of the fighters in the UFC or from other</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

1355
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 3>they're from Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like conor Mcgregor,</v>

1356
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 3>they're from Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Amanda Nunez.</v>

1357
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly diverse lineup of people from</v>

1358
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for her to say that is like so silly,</v>

1359
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.003
<v Speaker 3>but I can understand saying that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think it's an art by your </v>

1360
00:57:59.081 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>

1361
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:01.263
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the larger point is that humans are </v>

1362
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:04.310
<v Speaker 3>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1363
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 3>general are silly and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>individually that smart.</v>

1364
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I think performance arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as far as dance,</v>

1365
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean dance is clearly an art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1366
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:15.004
<v Speaker 3>If you watch Mikhail Baryshnikov,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's clearly art and I think in many </v>

1367
00:58:18.401 --> 00:58:23.401
<v Speaker 3>ways competition in performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like gymnastics is also an art.</v>

1368
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.630
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of it as an art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think of it as a sport,</v>

1369
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>execute these spectacular moves,</v>

1370
00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that doing it to a concerto,</v>

1371
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's still art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1372
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:40.501
<v Speaker 3>like you see some amazing gymnast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly through the air and nail a landing.</v>

1373
00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's glorious.</v>

1374
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's art in competition,</v>

1375
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.273
<v Speaker 3>but it's not one on one competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now art in one on one competition is </v>

1376
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Edson Barboza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll kicking Terry Adam.</v>

1377
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I know it doesn't look like art to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1378
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.143
<v Speaker 3>but to me it does well and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically extremely difficult move in </v>

1379
00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:00.990
<v Speaker 3>clinic and a lot of time to practice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get good at it.</v>

1380
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's just the fact that when he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>his beautiful pair of wet,</v>

1381
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.640
<v Speaker 3>it just lands in someone's face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1382
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 3>someone has to suffer because someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to suffer and perhaps sometimes both</v>

1383
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 3>people have to suffer in terms of a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal fight.</v>

1384
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:17.223
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at like Amanda Nunez </v>

1385
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 3>knockout out of Ronda Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an Amanda Nunez Fan,</v>

1386
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 3>that is a beautiful</v>

1387
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.023
<v Speaker 2>work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1388
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:26.120
<v Speaker 2>because she didn't get any promotion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

1389
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 2>She was looked at like cannon fodder to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in there and fight rousy.</v>

1390
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were predicting a first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round victory and she went out there and</v>

1391
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:35.760
<v Speaker 2>fucked her up in 48 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's art too.</v>

1392
00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 2>To some people it might not be to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1393
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.241
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>

1394
00:59:40.241 --> 00:59:42.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean this comes down to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1395
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.420
<v Speaker 4>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1396
00:59:43.421 --> 00:59:48.370
<v Speaker 4>So in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberals massively over favor the notion</v>

1397
00:59:48.371 --> 00:59:50.920
<v Speaker 4>of caring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like their big,</v>

1398
00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:53.230
<v Speaker 4>big moral intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1399
00:59:53.231 --> 00:59:55.870
<v Speaker 4>So they care about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1400
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 4>They care about protecting children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>toddlers from dangerous guns,</v>

1401
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just sort of.</v>

1402
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Everything is interpreted through caring</v>
<v Speaker 4>and wanting to protect.</v>

1403
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.970
<v Speaker 4>So understandably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they look at an MMA fight,</v>

1404
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.661
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1405
01:00:07.661 --> 01:00:10.870
<v Speaker 4>that's bad because there's not caring </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people are getting hurt,</v>

1406
01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting their feelings hurt.</v>

1407
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:13.263
<v Speaker 4>And so when Jordan Peterson is on here </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's talking about how it's this </v>

1408
01:00:15.431 --> 01:00:16.264
<v Speaker 4>very sort of maternal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a very maternal thing and the </v>

1409
01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:20.350
<v Speaker 4>problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1410
01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:21.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what ends up happening is,</v>

1411
01:00:21.821 --> 01:00:24.670
<v Speaker 4>is that when you have an echo chamber </v>
<v Speaker 4>like college campuses,</v>

1412
01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:28.210
<v Speaker 4>which are incredibly liberal with very </v>
<v Speaker 4>few outside opinions,</v>

1413
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.730
<v Speaker 4>that that's the rabbit hole that they go</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1414
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:35.020
<v Speaker 4>they go down the caring rabbit hole and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go down the caring rabbit hole,</v>

1415
01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:35.854
<v Speaker 4>you end up at Marxism and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're surrounded by people who </v>

1416
01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:39.244
<v Speaker 4>essentially think like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one to like sit you down and </v>

1417
01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:43.540
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking nuts.</v>

1418
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Like let's talk about though the,</v>

1419
01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.560
<v Speaker 2>that is why do you think going down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring rabbit hole lead you to Marxism?</v>

1420
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know you don't want anyone's</v>

1421
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 4>feelings to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want everybody to have enough.</v>

1422
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to share.</v>

1423
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 4>And it's important to realize back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your point where you said like,</v>

1424
01:00:58.611 --> 01:00:59.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was the three of us,</v>

1425
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:01.490
<v Speaker 4>communism might work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1426
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.713
<v Speaker 4>It comes back to the Dunbar number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you actually look at hunter gatherer </v>

1427
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:07.790
<v Speaker 4>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're communists right there,</v>

1428
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really socialist.</v>

1429
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.180
<v Speaker 4>And what they do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1430
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.220
<v Speaker 4>they have these behaviors where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1431
01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:15.290
<v Speaker 4>they'll drag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go and kill a deer,</v>

1432
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:16.303
<v Speaker 4>we drag it into the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>village so everybody can see the deer </v>

1433
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.113
<v Speaker 4>and then we divided up and then you make</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that you give it to everybody else </v>

1434
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:25.910
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you take the last piece and you</v>

1435
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 4>take the smallest piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1436
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:29.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you do with birthday cake,</v>

1437
01:01:29.241 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to show everybody like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>being Super Sherry here.</v>

1438
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.470
<v Speaker 4>Isn't this great?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not thinking about myself and at the</v>

1439
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:37.304
<v Speaker 4>level of a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I can track all of the </v>

1440
01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:43.160
<v Speaker 4>interactions we can attract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can track the fact that,</v>

1441
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1442
01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking hung over there is not pulling</v>

1443
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:49.030
<v Speaker 4>his weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Such a,</v>

1444
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:50.443
<v Speaker 4>such a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the point we go and we talk </v>

1445
01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:53.271
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1446
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:56.390
<v Speaker 4>we talk shit about 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we go and we go and we confront</v>

1447
01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We say among you fucking piece of shit.</v>

1448
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Like we go out all hunting all day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you sit around and you know,</v>

1449
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.170
<v Speaker 4>there's always going to be an honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is always going to be an along and</v>

1450
01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:08.990
<v Speaker 4>if you have enough people for sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have 100 people.</v>

1451
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.030
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be one and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>

1452
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:14.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a strategy that works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1453
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 4>fat sack of Shit.</v>

1454
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>You come back and all guava,</v>

1455
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.870
<v Speaker 3>like you ate all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1456
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to plot to kill ung.</v>

1457
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.083
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or to get him to pull his weight for </v>

1458
01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.041
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1459
01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you just say kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take them on.</v>

1460
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Take them hunting and have him have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>

1461
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Come over the fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1462
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Look over there dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at waterfall or get them to hang</v>

1463
01:02:37.641 --> 01:02:39.300
<v Speaker 3>out with a toddler with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.310
<v Speaker 3>They don't have that as though the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second word.</v>

1465
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Tyler with little kids can't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>stretch that far.</v>

1466
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Talking to now you have a zero worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about being shot by a bone marrow from a</v>

1467
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 3>toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another reason why arrows are superior.</v>

1468
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

1469
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:57.384
<v Speaker 3>but Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism being like a communist ideology </v>

1470
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:03.630
<v Speaker 3>of Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being that you know,</v>

1471
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 3>everyone should be more equal sharing </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1472
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.333
<v Speaker 3>but as Jordan Peterson pointed out so </v>
<v Speaker 3>eloquently on your podcast and on my </v>

1473
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't really work.</v>

1474
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.760
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work at 7 billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more 300 million people,</v>

1475
01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:17.883
<v Speaker 3>50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works at 50 or $150 because that's </v>

1476
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:23.970
<v Speaker 3>what our brain can track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is that I can't track all</v>

1477
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:26.520
<v Speaker 3>the ungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works great without technology.</v>

1478
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 3>It works great without access to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>

1479
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 3>That works great in a consolidated </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

1480
01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 3>a small controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contained environment,</v>

1481
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work when a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially there's,</v>

1482
01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in an apartment building,</v>

1483
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:40.710
<v Speaker 3>have 2000 people and you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking talk to anybody,</v>

1484
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what do people say?</v>

1485
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should work and we can make it work.</v>

1486
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:48.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just this old outdated mindset that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fuckers grew up.</v>

1487
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 3>You guys grew up way back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the influence of the Internet.</v>

1488
01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:53.163
<v Speaker 3>Now we understand thatZ is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>respectable pronoun and we need to be </v>

1489
01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 3>using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you say that?</v>

1490
01:03:58.621 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>

1491
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.090
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so know there's 75 options.</v>

1492
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1493
01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the experts making people</v>

1494
01:04:08.851 --> 01:04:09.870
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1495
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Oxford is again also gone down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole,</v>

1496
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:12.751
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1497
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:13.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleges and academia are not going to </v>

1498
01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:18.380
<v Speaker 3>go back out of the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just getting.</v>

1499
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:19.263
<v Speaker 3>They're going to keep going down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole until the larger community </v>

1500
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:25.440
<v Speaker 3>holds them accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that that's happening at</v>

1501
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:26.274
<v Speaker 3>all now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was the president of </v>

1502
01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Chicago University that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey listen,</v>

1503
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a safe space is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1504
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.823
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be any trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>warnings to shut the fuck up and go to </v>

1505
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:36.390
<v Speaker 3>work and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the marketplace of ideas.</v>

1506
01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Express yourself,</v>

1507
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 3>get your ideas challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate these ideas.</v>

1508
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out what's right rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's safe.</v>

1509
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.233
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think a large part of how you do </v>

1510
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that faster.</v>

1511
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:49.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean firstly people already doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>

1512
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 3>there's the guy in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Jordan Peterson,</v>

1513
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:53.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the larger community is having a </v>

1514
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:54.564
<v Speaker 3>conversation about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the faster way to do this is </v>

1515
01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:57.540
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1516
01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:58.374
<v Speaker 3>You confront people with science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you force people to either are you </v>

1517
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:02.364
<v Speaker 3>either accepting reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you denying reality and if you're </v>

1518
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:06.054
<v Speaker 3>denying reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got a real problem because now </v>

1519
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 3>you look like a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1520
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:11.310
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about science,</v>

1521
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.203
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run into a real issue when it comes </v>

1522
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:14.640
<v Speaker 3>to gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Gender and science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like gender as is discussed</v>

1524
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.293
<v Speaker 2>on campuses today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that gets things get real weird </v>

1525
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.133
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets real sort of loose and open to </v>

1526
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>interpretation and even though you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically a male,</v>

1527
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>you can identify as a woman and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct way to treat you as to treat you</v>

1528
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:33.950
<v Speaker 2>as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

1529
01:05:33.951 --> 01:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>we're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're outside the realm of science now.</v>

1530
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in into the world of social </v>

1531
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>constructs and agreed upon behavior,</v>

1532
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 4>but the science exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just in journals and it hasn't been</v>

1533
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:45.334
<v Speaker 4>brought and made accessible to these </v>
<v Speaker 4>children and there are ways to do it </v>

1534
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 4>very simply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1535
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 4>do you know the story of David Reimer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1536
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this was a kid in the sixties,</v>

1537
01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I think it was Canadian and for some</v>

1538
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:58.534
<v Speaker 4>bizarre reason right at the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the surgeon decides to use an </v>

1539
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:03.064
<v Speaker 4>electrocautery needle to circumcise him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and basically there's a huge botch up </v>

1540
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 4>and he manages to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he manages to chop off most of his dick.</v>

1541
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the parents are like,</v>

1542
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.110
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't put that back on,</v>

1543
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:17.973
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they end up going to the world's </v>

1544
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:24.370
<v Speaker 4>leading specialist in the 19 sixties or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

1545
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:28.180
<v Speaker 4>50 sixties on gender identity and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>

1546
01:06:28.181 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 4>which is this guy Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

1547
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.813
<v Speaker 4>And they go and see Dr Munday and Dr Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>money convinces them to castrate their </v>

1548
01:06:39.461 --> 01:06:42.730
<v Speaker 4>penis lists son and to raise him as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

1549
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.040
<v Speaker 4>And so they have to go and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1550
01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 4>take their son in and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1551
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 4>David who is now going to be raised as </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brenda,</v>

1552
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:51.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1553
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:52.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Money is showing pictures of naked </v>

1554
01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:56.314
<v Speaker 4>men to Brenda and saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what girls like and all this </v>

1555
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.070
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1556
01:07:03.071 --> 01:07:03.904
<v Speaker 4>is forcing him to wear women's clothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're going to do hormone therapy </v>

1557
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:07.714
<v Speaker 4>and all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Dr Money is meanwhile publishing </v>

1558
01:07:10.421 --> 01:07:11.920
<v Speaker 4>papers that is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1559
01:07:11.921 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 4>this is a tremendous success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1560
01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Like gender is all a construct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1561
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:17.801
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1562
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:18.461
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1563
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:20.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly adjusting to life as a girl.</v>

1564
01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:22.440
<v Speaker 4>All this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the plan is,</v>

1565
01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:22.961
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1566
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 4>they're going to do surgery and give him</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vagina and all this sort of stuff.</v>

1567
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Not some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1568
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is Brenda doing?</v>

1569
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:31.263
<v Speaker 4>Brenda's hitting things with sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brenda has no interest in playing with </v>

1570
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:35.644
<v Speaker 4>her sewing machine except for the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>time that she takes a screwdriver and </v>

1571
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:39.514
<v Speaker 4>picks it apart to figure out how it </v>
<v Speaker 4>works and doesn't want to hang out with </v>

1572
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:43.564
<v Speaker 4>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only wants to hang out with boys only </v>

1573
01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Speaker 4>wants to play with her brothers toys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1574
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 4>so all these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at some point,</v>

1575
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when the kid is like 13,</v>

1576
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:52.510
<v Speaker 4>14,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Jig is up,</v>

1577
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:53.403
<v Speaker 4>they figure out that they better tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brenda the truth and Brenda finds out </v>

1578
01:07:57.221 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 4>the truth and proceeds to essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1579
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:06.031
<v Speaker 4>have a mastectomy to remove her breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>switches to male hormones and you know,</v>

1580
01:08:06.701 --> 01:08:10.470
<v Speaker 4>instantly goes to living as a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what happens is,</v>

1581
01:08:10.471 --> 01:08:11.304
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1582
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Brenda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now David grows up,</v>

1583
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 4>marries woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1584
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a relationship,</v>

1585
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.040
<v Speaker 4>but unsurprisingly has a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological issues and ultimately goes</v>

1586
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:25.094
<v Speaker 4>into a supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a grow a parking lot and blows his </v>

1587
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:28.634
<v Speaker 4>brains out.</v>

1588
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point is,</v>

1589
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 4>is that I think that if you really want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about gender,</v>

1590
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.110
<v Speaker 4>you should force anybody who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deny gender to talk about David Reimer.</v>

1591
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.243
<v Speaker 4>You Make David Reimer household name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're all going to talk about what </v>

1592
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 4>lessons can we learn from the tragedy of</v>
<v Speaker 4>j Dot David Reimer.</v>

1593
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 4>And if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1594
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many listeners do you have at this </v>

1595
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 4>point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1596
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:51.944
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you get your tens of millions of </v>

1597
01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:55.431
<v Speaker 4>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$30,</v>

1598
01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 4>million plus listeners talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>David Reimer and you're like,</v>

1599
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make David Reimer </v>
<v Speaker 4>household name.</v>

1600
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.443
<v Speaker 4>We're going to make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tragedy of David Reimer is something </v>

1601
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:05.264
<v Speaker 4>that everybody knows about and learns </v>
<v Speaker 4>about and everybody's tweeting and </v>

1602
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:08.924
<v Speaker 4>talking about David Reimer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then suddenly it becomes very hard for </v>

1603
01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:15.500
<v Speaker 4>anybody to say that gender is purely a </v>
<v Speaker 4>construct.</v>

1604
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 4>There may be spectrums and there may be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1605
01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:20.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird in between areas,</v>

1606
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:24.020
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is that a lot of gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>is genetic and the sciences there,</v>

1607
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.003
<v Speaker 4>and you're not going to get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>social justice warriors to read science </v>

1608
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:28.400
<v Speaker 4>because most people don't actually read </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

1609
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 4>but you will get them to engage with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>story of David Slash Brenda Reimer.</v>

1610
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1611
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:33.933
<v Speaker 2>there's most certainly as a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a high percentage of </v>

1612
01:09:37.811 --> 01:09:38.644
<v Speaker 2>people that operate in a very specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>area of that spectrum and you're going </v>

1613
01:09:42.431 --> 01:09:45.280
<v Speaker 2>to get some kids that are convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are boys,</v>

1614
01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.373
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those kids grow up and they </v>

1615
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:48.274
<v Speaker 2>changed their mind as they get older and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that really deserves </v>

1616
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:52.294
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I see nine year olds that are on </v>

1617
01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.540
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1618
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:57.250
<v Speaker 2>this seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this kid really thinks he's a girl.</v>

1619
01:09:57.251 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Let him think he's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as is like,</v>

1620
01:09:59.711 --> 01:10:01.740
<v Speaker 2>why are you adding hormones to the mix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1621
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you suggesting surgery when he </v>

1622
01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:05.074
<v Speaker 2>turns 15 or whatever the fuck the ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this seems like something that </v>

1623
01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:12.601
<v Speaker 2>should be worked out by a grown adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fully developed frontal cortex.</v>

1624
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:14.490
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't see.</v>

1625
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And also like the influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents to change how this kid.</v>

1626
01:10:18.611 --> 01:10:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a kid and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter and your daughter just wants to</v>

1627
01:10:22.241 --> 01:10:25.930
<v Speaker 2>cut all her hair off and climb trees and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let her do that.</v>

1628
01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.003
<v Speaker 2>Like if she wants to be a boy letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks she's a boy and and work it all </v>

1629
01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:31.390
<v Speaker 2>out one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1630
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:32.283
<v Speaker 2>But to work it all out and to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that behavior or to say we're going to </v>

1631
01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:36.604
<v Speaker 2>bring you to a transgender specialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>right away and they're going to </v>

1632
01:10:38.831 --> 01:10:39.664
<v Speaker 2>prescribe this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many of these people are going </v>

1633
01:10:41.711 --> 01:10:45.190
<v Speaker 2>to be like Brenda reimers original </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor?</v>

1634
01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Well there was a male name was a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>named David,</v>

1635
01:10:48.281 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 2>David Reimer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Reimer's original doctor who,</v>

1636
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:52.203
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:55.270
<v Speaker 2>proclaiming it was such a success when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tour shit</v>

1638
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.990
<v Speaker 4>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raw reality,</v>

1639
01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:58.930
<v Speaker 4>denial leads to tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1640
01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.893
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what we have to be engaged with is </v>

1641
01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:02.024
<v Speaker 4>what is reality and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I sit here and have read </v>

1642
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 4>literally all of the science I can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1643
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:09.500
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's far too vast to project and science</v>

1644
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 4>isn't supposed to be an individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>

1645
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:12.343
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to be a collective project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all trying to really figure out </v>

1646
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:15.534
<v Speaker 4>what is this bitch known as reality that</v>
<v Speaker 4>has evaded us for millions of years or </v>

1647
01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 4>tens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

1648
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.660
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1649
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.533
<v Speaker 4>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that if you want to talk about like </v>

1650
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.903
<v Speaker 4>gender for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about people who are </v>

1651
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:29.394
<v Speaker 4>Intersex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are some people who are born and </v>

1652
01:11:32.161 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1653
01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 4>their genitalia at birth aren't clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>male or female and what they now do,</v>

1654
01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:38.634
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the medical community is that you </v>

1655
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 4>basically find out what are they </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetically,</v>

1656
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:42.781
<v Speaker 4>are they x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y,</v>

1657
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:43.860
<v Speaker 4>or are they xx?</v>

1658
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.933
<v Speaker 4>And then you raise them as that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't do hormones and you don't </v>

1659
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:51.810
<v Speaker 4>do surgery precisely because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to let them decide.</v>

1660
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you are,</v>

1661
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how much better.</v>

1662
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.243
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why is this surgeon using an </v>

1663
01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 4>electrocautery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neil needle to do circumcision?</v>

1664
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1665
01:12:01.441 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a dumb choice by a surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But imagine if they'd said,</v>

1666
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fuck up happened.</v>

1667
01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 4>We can't unfuck that up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not going to now make it worse</v>

1668
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 4>by chopping off his balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1669
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 4>this was what year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in the sixties,</v>

1670
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.240
<v Speaker 4>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties.</v>

1671
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:19.290
<v Speaker 4>The amount of data they had back then </v>
<v Speaker 4>was so limited and we've now,</v>

1672
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.360
<v Speaker 4>we've now got a lot more data and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1673
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.343
<v Speaker 4>David,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brenda Reimer is not an isolated </v>

1674
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:26.010
<v Speaker 4>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There've been other incidents like that.</v>

1675
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1676
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they very like,</v>

1677
01:12:28.831 --> 01:12:29.664
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that everything turns out </v>

1678
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 4>David,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brenda Reimer,</v>

1679
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:33.743
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1680
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:37.830
<v Speaker 4>But if you really care about children </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you really care about people,</v>

1681
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:40.050
<v Speaker 4>which is the sort of the big liberal </v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

1682
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the hippocratic oath,</v>

1683
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.553
<v Speaker 4>the whole point of being a doctor is </v>
<v Speaker 4>their first responsibility is do no </v>

1684
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.710
<v Speaker 4>harm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1685
01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to make things </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>

1686
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can make things better without,</v>

1687
01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:53.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really possibly making things worse,</v>

1688
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Speaker 4>then that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so again,</v>

1689
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.633
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

1690
01:12:56.690 --> 01:13:00.480
<v Speaker 4>we don't let children vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't let children drive.</v>

1691
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Why would we let them make such a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision at such a young age?</v>

1692
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think whatever the decision ends </v>

1693
01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:09.691
<v Speaker 4>up being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1694
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 4>people are going to make their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual decisions,</v>

1695
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:12.864
<v Speaker 4>so be it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you want to make sure that the </v>

1696
01:13:14.101 --> 01:13:15.660
<v Speaker 4>decision is an informed decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1697
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1698
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:18.283
<v Speaker 3>there's forbidden territory when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to gender and gender identity as </v>

1699
01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:24.770
<v Speaker 3>far as like what you are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate or not allowed to debate.</v>

1700
01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:26.563
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of forbidden territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a pretty obvious that the </v>

1701
01:13:31.101 --> 01:13:31.934
<v Speaker 3>origin of that forbidden behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forbidden thinking is that people that </v>

1702
01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:37.784
<v Speaker 3>are transgender or gay or marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 3>in any way have been discriminated </v>

1703
01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:45.770
<v Speaker 3>against and treated poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we recognize that.</v>

1704
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.753
<v Speaker 3>So we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we automatically stop any critical </v>

1705
01:13:49.761 --> 01:13:52.970
<v Speaker 3>thinking when it comes to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can't be crazy.</v>

1706
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 3>They must be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1707
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.703
<v Speaker 3>it's just a transgender issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't be that they're crazy and </v>

1708
01:13:58.371 --> 01:14:00.140
<v Speaker 3>transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's never discussed.</v>

1709
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:02.420
<v Speaker 3>It can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gay and stupid as fuck.</v>

1710
01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:02.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1711
01:14:02.961 --> 01:14:03.141
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1712
01:14:03.141 --> 01:14:04.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gay People are wonderful.</v>

1713
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.080
<v Speaker 3>They're all amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1714
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Because they've all been discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

1715
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the point is you don't,</v>

1716
01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:09.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1717
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 3>human beings are human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>

1718
01:14:11.921 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>when</v>

1719
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 4>we had Jordan Peterson on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the questions that I asked him,</v>

1720
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a super important </v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

1721
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 4>is Jordan's a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1722
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 4>And I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1723
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 4>so let's imagine you had a patient who </v>
<v Speaker 4>came here and said,</v>

1724
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:24.094
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be called by one of the 70 </v>

1725
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.320
<v Speaker 4>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1726
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 4>What as your patient would you then do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1727
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.813
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you came to me and said to me that </v>

1728
01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:32.914
<v Speaker 4>you were Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to as a responsible doctor </v>

1729
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 4>first decide that it was in my best </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest to call you Jesus Christ.</v>

1730
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.680
<v Speaker 4>So I have to figure out really what is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that about and is it going to serve your</v>

1731
01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:48.100
<v Speaker 4>outcome to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1732
01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's unaccountability for any human,</v>

1733
01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:51.694
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a celebrity or a sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>star or a rapper or a gay person or a </v>

1734
01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 4>transgender person or a politician or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist is bad.</v>

1735
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Like humans need accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's just the reality.</v>

1736
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:03.874
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we go fucking nut balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if for any reason a human is denied </v>

1737
01:15:07.061 --> 01:15:10.060
<v Speaker 4>accountability to other humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a problem,</v>

1738
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1739
01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:11.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing them a disservice by </v>

1740
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 2>thinking that your in somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping them or you know,</v>

1741
01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:19.930
<v Speaker 2>like that stupid article earlier today </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were talking about,</v>

1742
01:15:19.931 --> 01:15:20.764
<v Speaker 2>about these people showing up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist and a conference and then the </v>

1743
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 2>white people being forced to check their</v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>

1744
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Like this is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ruining the whole thing with this</v>

1745
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 2>kind of short sighted shitty thinking.</v>

1746
01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I want to really go down the rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 4>hole.</v>

1747
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do it.</v>

1748
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you know Thomas Soul?</v>

1749
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I know that name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we do that name?</v>

1750
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:43.890
<v Speaker 4>Thomas soul is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous conservative.</v>

1751
01:15:43.891 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 4>He's at Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1752
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.340
<v Speaker 4>he's at the Hoover Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1753
01:15:47.341 --> 01:15:48.360
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1754
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:49.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within this,</v>

1755
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:52.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first just to set all this up,</v>

1756
01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.780
<v Speaker 4>we should set up briefly how does </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture work,</v>

1757
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.733
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way culture works is that it </v>

1758
01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.480
<v Speaker 4>like genetic evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works based on blind copying.</v>

1759
01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.110
<v Speaker 4>So what ends up happening is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in all of people,</v>

1760
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:06.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look up to people and so you blindly</v>

1761
01:16:06.691 --> 01:16:07.524
<v Speaker 4>copied the things they do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically you start by blindly </v>

1762
01:16:10.681 --> 01:16:13.050
<v Speaker 4>copying from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you work in,</v>

1763
01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.720
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing you do is you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone and you're like,</v>

1764
01:16:15.721 --> 01:16:17.160
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person's fucking amazing.</v>

1765
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.260
<v Speaker 4>That rockstar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sports star or whatever,</v>

1766
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.273
<v Speaker 4>and you start dressing like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start walking like them and all of </v>

1767
01:16:22.891 --> 01:16:25.620
<v Speaker 4>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now in a hunter gatherer context,</v>

1768
01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:29.550
<v Speaker 4>that would be somebody who is a hunter </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a gatherer and you're like,</v>

1769
01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.241
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1770
01:16:30.241 --> 01:16:33.120
<v Speaker 4>she finds all the best guavas how does </v>
<v Speaker 4>she do that?</v>

1771
01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:36.950
<v Speaker 4>And then among fucking eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

1773
01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:38.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

1774
01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you would like hang out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd sort of Shimmy up to her.</v>

1775
01:16:41.911 --> 01:16:43.770
<v Speaker 4>You'd be seeing what she'd be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1776
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.591
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1777
01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:47.280
<v Speaker 4>That she looks for a very particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>color of guava.</v>

1778
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 4>She squeezes them in a certain way and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over time you learn what she's doing.</v>

1779
01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:54.240
<v Speaker 4>And then ultimately you even learn how </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's thinking.</v>

1780
01:16:55.050 --> 01:17:00.050
<v Speaker 4>But in a large scale society like ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't meet Michael Jordan,</v>

1781
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jordan just becomes this sort of</v>

1782
01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:04.440
<v Speaker 4>distant person that I idolized.</v>

1783
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:08.670
<v Speaker 4>And so advertisers have figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hijack these mechanisms and they know</v>

1784
01:17:08.671 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 4>if you a burger next to Michael Jordan's</v>
<v Speaker 4>face that I'm like,</v>

1785
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.790
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be like Michael Jordan,</v>

1786
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:16.340
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to eat a big Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1787
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 4>And little children are dumb and so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>blindly copy that,</v>

1788
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:21.590
<v Speaker 4>or Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be like James Dean,</v>

1789
01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.453
<v Speaker 4>he has a cigarette in his mouth and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to blindly copy that and we don't </v>

1790
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:25.844
<v Speaker 4>understand that the burger or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette is not actually the key to </v>

1791
01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:30.314
<v Speaker 4>being as successful or as cool as or as </v>
<v Speaker 4>good at basketball as Michael Jordan or </v>

1792
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 4>James Deane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1793
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where that comes from.</v>

1794
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:40.340
<v Speaker 4>So we have this tendency to blindly copy</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything we can.</v>

1795
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it makes sense.</v>

1796
01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in,</v>

1797
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:45.950
<v Speaker 4>in a mass society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we never work our way in.</v>

1798
01:17:45.951 --> 01:17:47.960
<v Speaker 4>We never learn the mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1799
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.630
<v Speaker 4>We just sort of remained at this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>very superficial level.</v>

1800
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 4>So what that means is that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did this all start?</v>

1801
01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 4>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Where were you going with this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1803
01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:01.450
<v Speaker 4>we're starting at culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how culture works,</v>

1804
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>how culture works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1805
01:18:02.601 --> 01:18:04.100
<v Speaker 4>so now we're going to talk about black </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1806
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

1807
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 4>So Thomas Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Soul is a black guy,</v>

1808
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.083
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Thomas Soul has for years and years </v>

1809
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:15.403
<v Speaker 4>and years being trying to fight racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's been trying to fight racism by </v>

1810
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 4>having a conversation about culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1811
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that there are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>two different sort of,</v>

1812
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:25.973
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1813
01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.820
<v Speaker 4>we're speaking broadly here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1814
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 4>But this is for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>

1815
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:30.913
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to tell a simple story to </v>

1816
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:32.750
<v Speaker 4>start off with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1817
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:37.640
<v Speaker 4>So broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts two different cultures of people</v>

1818
01:18:37.641 --> 01:18:41.150
<v Speaker 4>with dark skin next to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one culture is these people from the</v>

1819
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:41.984
<v Speaker 4>West indies.</v>

1820
01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:43.063
<v Speaker 4>And one culture is this group of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who grew up in the south with slavery </v>

1821
01:18:46.131 --> 01:18:47.930
<v Speaker 4>and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1822
01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:51.260
<v Speaker 4>what one group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the West indies group does really well.</v>

1823
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.720
<v Speaker 4>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the successful black people,</v>

1824
01:18:53.721 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 4>people like Colin Powell are originally </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that cultural heritage.</v>

1825
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.573
<v Speaker 4>The other group is the group that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>find in ghettos and African American </v>

1826
01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 4>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of that sort of stuff,</v>

1827
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:04.640
<v Speaker 4>they don't do well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1828
01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 4>They don't get good education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shoot each other,</v>

1829
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:11.060
<v Speaker 4>they're all these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why soul has been telling</v>

1830
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 4>this story is because he's been trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

1831
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:14.383
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when liberals look at the people in </v>

1832
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Ghettos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

1833
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>

1834
01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're not succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Soul is saying,</v>

1835
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1836
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 4>Because if you look at this group from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the West indies,</v>

1837
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.120
<v Speaker 4>they also came from the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 4>slavery.</v>

1838
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.910
<v Speaker 4>There was slavery in the West indies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are also black.</v>

1839
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 4>So they also faced racism and yet they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do well.</v>

1840
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:36.343
<v Speaker 4>So it has to be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that other thing is the fact that </v>

1841
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.230
<v Speaker 4>these black people who were in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>south,</v>

1842
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:43.303
<v Speaker 4>there's always been a big question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're black people robbed of their </v>

1843
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:48.980
<v Speaker 4>culture or did they preserve their </v>
<v Speaker 4>authentic African culture?</v>

1844
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 4>And what soul is saying is that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were robbed of their culture.</v>

1845
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:57.110
<v Speaker 4>And so they picked up the culture of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people around them and the people around</v>

1846
01:19:57.111 --> 01:19:57.944
<v Speaker 4>them were rednecks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at the white redneck </v>

1847
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 4>culture and the black redneck culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot of the same values.</v>

1848
01:20:04.761 --> 01:20:06.590
<v Speaker 4>They don't particularly respect </v>
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>

1849
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:11.990
<v Speaker 4>They love Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use violence in their conflicts and</v>

1850
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1851
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:14.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1852
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.660
<v Speaker 4>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1853
01:20:15.661 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the same values and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same outcomes.</v>

1854
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:18.743
<v Speaker 4>And even at bonaire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is black English is actually all </v>

1855
01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 4>from the west of England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually,</v>

1856
01:20:23.671 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 4>this is from the west of England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1857
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:28.770
<v Speaker 4>if you go to places like Cornwall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1858
01:20:28.771 --> 01:20:30.870
<v Speaker 4>there used to be this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1859
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these amazing ads on British TV,</v>

1860
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 4>right for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1861
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 4>this Devin custard or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they would always say,</v>

1862
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.071
<v Speaker 4>Devin News,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1863
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 4>they make it so creamy and they all talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>

1864
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:41.424
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it doesn't sound like black </v>

1865
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:44.070
<v Speaker 4>English,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do say things like,</v>

1866
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:44.933
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you be doing that and we be doing this </v>

1867
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 4>and you be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they be doing that.</v>

1868
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:52.920
<v Speaker 4>And so there's the use of that Copula be</v>
<v Speaker 4>right where instead of saying,</v>

1869
01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

1870
01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she is,</v>

1871
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:57.460
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just say I bub,</v>

1872
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 4>we be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They be,</v>

1873
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 4>which is the classic feature of Black </v>
<v Speaker 4>English,</v>

1874
01:21:00.691 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 4>African American vernacular English </v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1875
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:03.983
<v Speaker 4>Now the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that how I'm blower mindblower now </v>

1876
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:08.663
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you think that Thomas Soul has </v>

1877
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:12.330
<v Speaker 4>been received by Liberal America?</v>

1878
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Not Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not well,</v>

1879
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 4>and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soul has a book called black rednecks,</v>

1880
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 4>white liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1881
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 4>And his whole point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1882
01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 4>if you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1883
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 4>again like soul is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1884
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 4>he researches the shit out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1885
01:21:30.901 --> 01:21:32.820
<v Speaker 4>He really does this work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1886
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the experience of African</v>

1887
01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Americans after slavery after slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do really,</v>

1888
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.910
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start to make real progress,</v>

1889
01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:42.853
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a large part of the reason why they </v>

1890
01:21:43.951 --> 01:21:44.784
<v Speaker 4>make progress is because you start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a lot of people from New England </v>

1891
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:48.744
<v Speaker 4>either you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people from New England or white </v>

1892
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:53.850
<v Speaker 4>people from New England who come down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sort of reshape the culture.</v>

1893
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:57.120
<v Speaker 4>They create these schools and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching those New England values,</v>

1894
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's those puritan values of hard work,</v>

1895
01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:00.660
<v Speaker 4>tenacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that sort of stuff.</v>

1896
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:04.230
<v Speaker 4>And so there's all this progress and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have people like booker t Washington and</v>

1897
01:22:04.231 --> 01:22:07.710
<v Speaker 4>booker t dot Washington was an actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>slave and then after he got his freedom,</v>

1898
01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:10.860
<v Speaker 4>he got to go work in a salt mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is literally the worst job ever.</v>

1899
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 4>And in booker t Washington's up from </v>
<v Speaker 4>slavery,</v>

1900
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:14.514
<v Speaker 4>he tells this great story about seeing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>school house right and that he thought </v>

1901
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 4>that going into a school house was about</v>
<v Speaker 4>as close to heaven on earth as you could</v>

1902
01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:23.004
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a dude who wanted an </v>

1903
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:26.910
<v Speaker 4>education really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really badly,</v>

1904
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's a lot of what you find in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>early black experience in,</v>

1905
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the post slavery period.</v>

1906
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1907
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.880
<v Speaker 4>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1908
01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.773
<v Speaker 4>before sort of world war two actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>had higher rates of marriage than </v>

1909
01:22:39.151 --> 01:22:39.984
<v Speaker 4>whites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of these sorts of things that you </v>

1910
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:45.270
<v Speaker 4>know are now supposedly a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's this turnaround,</v>

1911
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The black experience starts to go south,</v>

1912
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:49.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts to get worse.</v>

1913
01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:51.820
<v Speaker 4>And what year is this around?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is post World War Two,</v>

1914
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.823
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1915
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so post slavery,</v>

1916
01:22:56.130 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 4>black people experience a rebounding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're starting to make some progress.</v>

1917
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 4>There is ambition and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1918
01:23:02.641 --> 01:23:05.040
<v Speaker 4>if in terms of books to read like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1919
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.700
<v Speaker 4>just because a large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1920
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:07.534
<v Speaker 4>a large part of what I'm trying to do in</v>
<v Speaker 4>general is really let's move to the </v>

1921
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:11.944
<v Speaker 4>place of all people are created equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like let's remove all these stupid </v>

1922
01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 4>distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1923
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:19.550
<v Speaker 4>And really live that principle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is,</v>

1924
01:23:19.551 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 4>is that in order to really live that </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1925
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>you need a new narrative that beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>slavery.</v>

1926
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.511
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1927
01:23:25.511 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go and talk to racist,</v>

1928
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:32.110
<v Speaker 4>you can't just say racism is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that doesn't destroy racism,</v>

1929
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.233
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What destroys racism is when you make </v>

1930
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 4>sense of the things that they know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1931
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:37.474
<v Speaker 4>They see people who are violent in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ghettos or they see crime or they see a </v>

1932
01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:44.800
<v Speaker 4>lack of education or they see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa is poor and you're able to tell a</v>

1933
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 4>better story that makes sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that they know,</v>

1934
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.470
<v Speaker 4>but also comes out with the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1935
01:23:50.471 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 4>we actually all have the same potential.</v>

1936
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:54.063
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have this issue with people </v>

1937
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:55.864
<v Speaker 4>imitating their atmosphere in retaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>their environment and this southern </v>

1938
01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:01.900
<v Speaker 4>style talk with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1939
01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:06.901
<v Speaker 4>the southern redneck influence on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>African American slaves,</v>

1940
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:08.410
<v Speaker 4>former slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

1941
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 4>how do you stop that and how do you turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>that around?</v>

1942
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in general for humanity,</v>

1943
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.313
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is sort of a big problem for </v>

1944
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:15.604
<v Speaker 4>humanity in general is that there's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>a culture alive today that is well </v>

1945
01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:20.770
<v Speaker 4>suited to the world that we're living </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1946
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1947
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.380
<v Speaker 4>culture is adapted to environment in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same way as any evolutionary thing.</v>

1948
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1949
01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at a like,</v>

1950
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:31.930
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about these hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1951
01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:32.764
<v Speaker 4>The Anam Amo or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a great story in the lost </v>

1952
01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:36.920
<v Speaker 4>city ofZ ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1953
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1954
01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 4>a Percy Fawcett who was an explorer </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes across,</v>

1955
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:42.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these tribes in the Amazon,</v>

1956
01:24:42.851 --> 01:24:46.690
<v Speaker 4>and one of the examples that the author </v>
<v Speaker 4>gives him there is a David Grann,</v>

1957
01:24:46.691 --> 01:24:48.680
<v Speaker 4>he talks about how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1958
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this group of tribesmen in the </v>

1959
01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:52.594
<v Speaker 4>Amazon and what they'll do is there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>this special leaf and they go and they </v>

1960
01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 4>squeeze this leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1961
01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:57.933
<v Speaker 4>They crush it up and this milky </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance runs into the water and then </v>

1962
01:25:01.271 --> 01:25:04.990
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden the fish float up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>surface upside down,</v>

1963
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been anesthetized by this.</v>

1964
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.193
<v Speaker 4>Whatever substance in the leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this little boy goes into the river </v>

1965
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 4>and he plucks out all the fattest fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as the milky cloud dissipates,</v>

1966
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:16.720
<v Speaker 4>the others fish swim away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1967
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Impressive as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1968
01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.160
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck did these tribesmen who </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have science,</v>

1969
01:25:21.161 --> 01:25:23.590
<v Speaker 4>don't have any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure this thing out.</v>

1970
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.150
<v Speaker 4>And it's cultural evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens is,</v>

1971
01:25:26.151 --> 01:25:27.520
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the nature of evolution.</v>

1972
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:28.354
<v Speaker 4>That's the nature of markets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because markets are an evolutionary </v>

1973
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:31.510
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1974
01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:32.344
<v Speaker 4>intelligent answers and intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>solutions can emerge from just sort of </v>

1975
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:37.054
<v Speaker 4>competing forces and so all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures are well adapted to a </v>

1976
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 4>particular environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

1977
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:43.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

1978
01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:46.810
<v Speaker 4>like we talked about American culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we talked about Russian culture,</v>

1979
01:25:46.811 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 4>Russian culture selects for pessimism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American culture because you had to move</v>

1980
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:52.600
<v Speaker 4>all the way across the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1981
01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 4>If you've got villages in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1982
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

1983
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.960
<v Speaker 4>who is the person in that village who </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

1984
01:25:59.050 --> 01:25:59.883
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go across the ocean to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>country I know nothing about and you </v>

1985
01:26:04.461 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a fortune,</v>

1986
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most optimistic individual.</v>

1987
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:09.343
<v Speaker 4>And so it's basically a magnet for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most optimistic individuals in the </v>

1988
01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:13.850
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The analogy,</v>

1989
01:26:13.851 --> 01:26:15.950
<v Speaker 4>I always use this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever see American tale,</v>

1990
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.390
<v Speaker 4>the like old animated movie from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the must be the nineties or whatever.</v>

1991
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I saw that.</v>

1992
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about a group of animated.</v>

1993
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.940
<v Speaker 4>It's animated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1995
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:30.680
<v Speaker 4>who made it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1996
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1997
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 4>it's not Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1998
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.260
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I saw that students,</v>

1999
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Spielberg will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2000
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of about the,</v>

2001
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.923
<v Speaker 4>it's about the immigrant experience more</v>
<v Speaker 4>generally and then specifically sort of </v>

2002
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.100
<v Speaker 4>about the Russian Jewish experience.</v>

2003
01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's about this family,</v>

2004
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:53.681
<v Speaker 4>the mouse Kevitsa is and right there on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2005
01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:54.913
<v Speaker 4>on that trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a 500 miles Kovitz and five old </v>

2006
01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 4>mouse Kovitz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2007
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.823
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the first part there in Russia and </v>

2008
01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all being persecuted by cats,</v>

2009
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there might be 500 miles of it's</v>

2010
01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:11.840
<v Speaker 4>sings a song with all of the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>Moskovitz is called.</v>

2011
01:27:11.841 --> 01:27:12.674
<v Speaker 4>There are no cats in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is so much of what the American </v>

2012
01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:18.470
<v Speaker 4>immigrant experiences about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2013
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:19.161
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2014
01:27:19.161 --> 01:27:21.290
<v Speaker 4>it's all going to be perfect land of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>

2015
01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:24.380
<v Speaker 4>The streets are paved with gold excepted</v>
<v Speaker 4>an American tale.</v>

2016
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:29.500
<v Speaker 4>The streets are paved with cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American t a L.</v>

2017
01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:33.360
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or Til t a.</v>

2018
01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2019
01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2020
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

2021
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.640
<v Speaker 4>these different environments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2022
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Just as you have different environments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>select for different,</v>

2023
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.113
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different beaks or wings or whatever it </v>

2024
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:48.830
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>select for different mindsets,</v>

2025
01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:51.140
<v Speaker 4>different ways of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different cultural traits.</v>

2026
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:52.003
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what ends up happening is we become </v>

2027
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:56.210
<v Speaker 4>well adapted to a particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2028
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:57.163
<v Speaker 4>So what happens to the point of the lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>city of z is what happened to all of </v>

2029
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:03.740
<v Speaker 4>these European explorers who went into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Amazon?</v>

2030
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.903
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them fucking tide and that's </v>

2031
01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 4>because they're doing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>well suited to England,</v>

2032
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 4>like walking around in wool suits and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating cans of chipped beef,</v>

2033
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:13.243
<v Speaker 4>but suddenly when you're in the hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree heat of the Amazon and there's </v>

2034
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:21.740
<v Speaker 4>all these animals you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you don't know how to use the plants</v>

2035
01:28:21.741 --> 01:28:24.680
<v Speaker 4>that you squeeze and have the anesthetic</v>
<v Speaker 4>in them and all that sort of stuff,</v>

2036
01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 4>you can't survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2037
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.200
<v Speaker 4>And what they called in velocity of CSI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the explorers,</v>

2038
01:28:30.201 --> 01:28:33.140
<v Speaker 4>they called it the Amazon UK counterfeit</v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

2039
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:36.560
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a paradise was so lush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so tropical,</v>

2040
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.513
<v Speaker 4>but there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing to fucking eat except </v>

2041
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.880
<v Speaker 4>clearly there was because Amazonian </v>
<v Speaker 4>people had been living there for tens of</v>

2042
01:28:43.881 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years.</v>

2043
01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.093
<v Speaker 4>They just did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Westerners didn't have the cultural </v>

2044
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:50.870
<v Speaker 4>software that was well suited to </v>
<v Speaker 4>surviving in that environment.</v>

2045
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:53.440
<v Speaker 4>So how does this translate into </v>
<v Speaker 4>African-american's?</v>

2046
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.553
<v Speaker 4>So what is the environment that created </v>
<v Speaker 4>that southern redneck culture and the </v>

2047
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 4>environment it turns out is right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So raising sheep,</v>

2048
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:04.194
<v Speaker 4>raising goats and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because most of the people who are in </v>

2049
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.540
<v Speaker 4>the south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm originally came from the Scots.</v>

2050
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:10.374
<v Speaker 4>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at hurting cultures </v>

2051
01:29:12.511 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 4>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have certain traits in common,</v>

2052
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:15.893
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a herder where you have a </v>

2053
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.570
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big problem,</v>

2054
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 4>and that big big problem is property </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights.</v>

2055
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.930
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are clear boundaries on my land.</v>

2056
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Now there are ways you can try and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2057
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 4>You can try and move the boundary stones</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my land slowly into your field,</v>

2058
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:31.351
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>

2059
01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:32.184
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

2060
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:35.340
<v Speaker 4>But what we usually have is we have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of government,</v>

2061
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.203
<v Speaker 4>there's a local town official that we go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to and he is responsible for policing </v>

2062
01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:40.464
<v Speaker 4>the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so towns would do things where you </v>

2063
01:29:42.351 --> 01:29:43.184
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would essentially all get together </v>

2064
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:46.850
<v Speaker 4>and we go walk the boundary stones and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we make sure that none of those boundary</v>

2065
01:29:46.851 --> 01:29:47.684
<v Speaker 4>stones had moved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the intuition of people from the </v>

2066
01:29:49.891 --> 01:29:50.724
<v Speaker 4>North Pier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like that is if we have a </v>

2067
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:53.574
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we go to the government and we resolve </v>

2068
01:29:54.811 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 4>it through the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in the environment of hurting,</v>

2069
01:29:59.100 --> 01:29:59.933
<v Speaker 4>you can come over and you can steal my </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep and you can mix the sheep in with </v>

2070
01:30:03.211 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 4>your flock and I have no way to prove </v>
<v Speaker 4>which my sh which cheaper my sheep.</v>

2071
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.600
<v Speaker 4>So we evolve things like branding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2072
01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:10.434
<v Speaker 4>Where I have a brand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it on my sheep and all that sort </v>

2073
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

2074
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.680
<v Speaker 4>But there's another strategy that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>used that evolved before branding.</v>

2075
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:20.310
<v Speaker 4>And that earlier strategy is being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy motherfucker.</v>

2076
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:24.540
<v Speaker 4>You establish a reputation as the kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of guy that you don't fuck with you.</v>

2077
01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Come on my land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kill you.</v>

2078
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.720
<v Speaker 4>You touch my sheep or my women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking kill you.</v>

2079
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:35.930
<v Speaker 4>And I use such an aggressive level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence that you know that you know,</v>

2080
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:38.550
<v Speaker 4>there is no point in fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2081
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 4>this is not plausible because I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2082
01:30:40.231 --> 01:30:42.120
<v Speaker 4>but let's imagine it much tougher </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

2083
01:30:42.121 --> 01:30:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2084
01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 4>is a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't fuck with conor Mcgregor,</v>

2085
01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:47.363
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a reputation as just being a bad </v>

2086
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:50.960
<v Speaker 4>ass motherfucker who will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2087
01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's how you keep people off your </v>
<v Speaker 4>land.</v>

2088
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at,</v>

2089
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:55.790
<v Speaker 4>let's look at a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures.</v>

2090
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:58.290
<v Speaker 4>So hurt cultures include the scots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish,</v>

2091
01:30:58.291 --> 01:30:59.460
<v Speaker 4>who are the rednecks.</v>

2092
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 4>A herder cultures include the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mongolians,</v>

2093
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.713
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Mongols notoriously a very gentle </v>

2094
01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:07.100
<v Speaker 4>peace loving people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2095
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.900
<v Speaker 4>And they include the Bedouins and where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Arabs,</v>

2096
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:10.973
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who had camels and all that sort of </v>

2097
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:12.954
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll notice that there is that </v>

2098
01:31:14.191 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 4>same use of violence and mostly they </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight amongst themselves.</v>

2099
01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:18.354
<v Speaker 4>There's this inter clan warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but periodically a charismatic figure </v>

2100
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:22.123
<v Speaker 4>emerged is who unites the clans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So gangas con manages to unite the </v>

2101
01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.980
<v Speaker 4>Mongols and then what are the Mongols </v>
<v Speaker 4>proceed to do?</v>

2102
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.740
<v Speaker 4>They proceed to go use that aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>use of violence.</v>

2103
01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 4>They have those horses which allow them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to move quickly,</v>

2104
01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:36.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're really effective and they go</v>

2105
01:31:36.841 --> 01:31:39.180
<v Speaker 4>and they fuck everybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2106
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:40.283
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gentle farmers of China aren't </v>

2107
01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:43.770
<v Speaker 4>prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the gentle farmers,</v>

2108
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:46.230
<v Speaker 4>a Persian aren't prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens with the Arabs,</v>

2109
01:31:46.231 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 4>the Arabs are mostly fighting amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

2110
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.253
<v Speaker 4>But then along comes this charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure with a new belief system that </v>

2111
01:31:51.901 --> 01:31:52.734
<v Speaker 4>unites the Muhammad and he unites them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and suddenly they fuck everybody up and </v>

2112
01:31:56.641 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 4>they create this great empire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the caliphate,</v>

2113
01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.220
<v Speaker 4>right spreads all across Central Asia </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Middle East and all across north</v>

2114
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2115
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 4>And in many ways that is what Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump is.</v>

2116
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:08.350
<v Speaker 4>They've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2117
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 4>the rednecks been fighting amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves for a long time.</v>

2118
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:15.070
<v Speaker 4>And then Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gang is con of America.</v>

2119
01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:19.300
<v Speaker 4>The Mohamad of America has succeeded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>uniting the clans and you know,</v>

2120
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.193
<v Speaker 4>in our time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't do it by going out and like </v>

2121
01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:23.254
<v Speaker 4>raping and pillaging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go and you seize the ballot box and </v>

2122
01:32:25.781 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 4>you vote and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really like take back power.</v>

2123
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2124
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 4>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look,</v>

2125
01:32:33.431 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 4>there are certain problems that occur </v>
<v Speaker 4>across these herder cultures.</v>

2126
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:38.620
<v Speaker 4>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2127
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:39.690
<v Speaker 4>as a friend of mine.</v>

2128
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying essentially saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the south,</v>

2129
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:45.580
<v Speaker 3>is that the reason why Donald Trump has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been elected because of the south,</v>

2130
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:46.350
<v Speaker 3>because of the herder</v>

2131
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:47.141
<v Speaker 4>culture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2132
01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you've read Hillbilly Elegy,</v>

2133
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 4>jd Vance's book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an excellent,</v>

2134
01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:53.734
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's really talking about this </v>

2135
01:32:54.221 --> 01:32:57.340
<v Speaker 4>hillbilly culture and so it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the south.</v>

2136
01:32:57.370 --> 01:32:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happened is,</v>

2137
01:32:58.681 --> 01:33:01.410
<v Speaker 4>is that it's Redneck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's rednecks,</v>

2138
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

2139
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:04.680
<v Speaker 4>whatever or hillbillies or whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to call them.</v>

2140
01:33:04.681 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 4>The folk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2141
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:06.454
<v Speaker 4>it's not even simple folk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a particular culture and they </v>

2142
01:33:08.081 --> 01:33:08.914
<v Speaker 4>have certain values and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also worth clarifying because of </v>

2143
01:33:11.141 --> 01:33:11.974
<v Speaker 4>the way that I sound and where I come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from and the fact that I went to </v>

2144
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.270
<v Speaker 4>And vitamin than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a part of that tribe that,</v>

2146
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:20.104
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans owe a tremendous debt to the </v>

2147
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:25.960
<v Speaker 4>hillbilly culture and that tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 4>debt is that overwhelmingly they are the</v>

2148
01:33:25.961 --> 01:33:26.794
<v Speaker 4>people who have served in the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they are overwhelmingly the people </v>

2149
01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:32.320
<v Speaker 4>who have fought our wars and blood and </v>
<v Speaker 4>died and all that sort of stuff.</v>

2150
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2151
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:34.743
<v Speaker 4>I may sound like a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't really sit in either of </v>

2152
01:33:37.031 --> 01:33:38.050
<v Speaker 4>those cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2153
01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:43.051
<v Speaker 4>I can critique the liberal culture and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can critique the hillbilly culture.</v>

2154
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2155
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.333
<v Speaker 4>white liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole reason why I started this </v>

2156
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:47.134
<v Speaker 4>thing off is because white liberals have</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own weird things that are </v>

2157
01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 4>dysfunctional in that aren't helping </v>
<v Speaker 4>black people and all that stuff.</v>

2158
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:52.803
<v Speaker 4>If you just wore a bow tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would think you were </v>

2159
01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:54.604
<v Speaker 4>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to do well then there you </v>

2160
01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe you have a bolo tie.</v>

2161
01:33:59.021 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I would like to do that.</v>

2162
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:04.540
<v Speaker 4>Like I like the texting Carter rancher </v>
<v Speaker 4>rancher,</v>

2163
01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 4>jade right there and pull that George W </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bush be from Connecticut,</v>

2164
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:08.230
<v Speaker 4>but dress</v>

2165
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:09.910
<v Speaker 3>like a cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was from Maine.</v>

2166
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Maine is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kennebunk port.</v>

2167
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:14.583
<v Speaker 3>That's where they're from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the whitest of white fucking </v>

2168
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:20.740
<v Speaker 3>north and people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>French folks.</v>

2169
01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Maine is filled with French folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maniacs.</v>

2170
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2171
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:26.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm also originally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know more your neck of the woods.</v>

2172
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>

2173
01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of gigs in Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maine's a fascinating place because it's</v>

2174
01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:35.380
<v Speaker 3>a entirely abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2175
01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.373
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of cities and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to drive like vast distances in between </v>

2176
01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:42.680
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go from Portland to Bangor,</v>

2177
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.060
<v Speaker 3>there was just like 50 plus mile stretch</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's nothing on the road.</v>

2178
01:34:47.061 --> 01:34:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a two lane highway and there ain't </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit on that road.</v>

2179
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:51.680
<v Speaker 3>No gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

2180
01:34:51.681 --> 01:34:53.150
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

2181
01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever run out of gas?</v>

2182
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.930
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever hear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a friend of mine,</v>

2183
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 4>dad's from Maine</v>

2184
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and he has all these great main isms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is a,</v>

2185
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:03.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go up past soy as band and </v>

2186
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>past Sawyer's barn is any place that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>far away.</v>

2187
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is I think fucking amazing.</v>

2188
01:35:11.481 --> 01:35:12.314
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of like the version of </v>

2189
01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2190
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Islamic 72 virgins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 72 virgins just means a shitload of</v>

2192
01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:21.980
<v Speaker 1>virgins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really mean the number seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2194
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:35:25.871 --> 01:35:26.704
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying you have a passel of </v>

2197
01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:28.094
<v Speaker 1>virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a good chunk of </v>

2198
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 1>virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2199
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So we get back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2200
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:33.770
<v Speaker 1>African American culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does it,</v>

2201
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>how does it correct itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what ends up happening?</v>

2202
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do is,</v>

2203
01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:38.364
<v Speaker 1>is that you just have to have a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger conversation about culture and </v>

2204
01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you have to talk about how culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

2205
01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:45.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to say it's not your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2206
01:35:45.351 --> 01:35:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Because the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that imitate our atmosphere.</v>

2207
01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:50.350
<v Speaker 1>We imitate our atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is,</v>

2208
01:35:50.351 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2209
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 1>these cultures are very old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hurt her culture is the same one.</v>

2210
01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:56.024
<v Speaker 1>And that's the big ironies is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not saying that it's about black </v>

2211
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.470
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about rednecks,</v>

2212
01:36:00.471 --> 01:36:02.470
<v Speaker 1>whether they're white rednecks or black </v>
<v Speaker 1>red necks.</v>

2213
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:03.343
<v Speaker 1>So that hurt our culture has just </v>
<v Speaker 1>inexorably tied itself into the African </v>

2214
01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 1>American culture without the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans even knowing that it happened.</v>

2215
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the nature of culture.</v>

2216
01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.813
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only tied itself into this very </v>

2217
01:36:16.311 --> 01:36:19.220
<v Speaker 1>specific subset of Africa of black </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

2218
01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:22.040
<v Speaker 1>which is why the people in the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>indies have a completely different.</v>

2219
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2220
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.133
<v Speaker 1>And if you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to people who are literally </v>

2221
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.953
<v Speaker 1>Africans who immigrated to America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from Ethiopia or Kenya or anything </v>

2222
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2223
01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 1>if you ever get an Ethiopian cab driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2224
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:35.140
<v Speaker 1>So hard working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.073
<v Speaker 1>Talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about how they feel about </v>

2226
01:36:38.661 --> 01:36:40.850
<v Speaker 1>that sort of ghetto black culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those black rednecks.</v>

2227
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 1>They fucking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey fucking hate it.</v>

2228
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 1>And the point is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>

2229
01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:46.700
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a bad name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2230
01:36:46.730 --> 01:36:47.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people see a black person and </v>

2231
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:49.311
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2232
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>you're like probably this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2233
01:36:50.841 --> 01:36:51.291
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2234
01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because again,</v>

2235
01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.220
<v Speaker 1>human stereotype because of the Dunbar </v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

2236
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.083
<v Speaker 1>because we can only track 150 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to make up stories about </v>

2237
01:36:58.971 --> 01:36:59.321
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:36:59.321 --> 01:37:01.340
<v Speaker 1>we fit into this rednecks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2239
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh you have a dukes of hazzard tee </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

2240
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do that.</v>

2241
01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point.</v>

2242
01:37:07.011 --> 01:37:07.844
<v Speaker 1>The listeners are going to be sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and they're going to be trying to </v>

2243
01:37:09.231 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 1>categorize me and all of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2244
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.313
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what you're dealing with is you </v>

2245
01:37:13.221 --> 01:37:14.054
<v Speaker 1>start talking about gender or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and the social justice </v>

2246
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 1>warriors try and put you into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket and you're like,</v>

2247
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't belong in that bucket.</v>

2248
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly trying to say I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that bucket.</v>

2249
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:25.100
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian,</v>

2250
01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:25.963
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've moved here and you really </v>

2251
01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 1>sort of believe in the American Dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>Land of opportunity and we work hard and</v>

2252
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:31.094
<v Speaker 1>we all do this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You keep getting put in that bucket </v>

2253
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 1>with all this sort of rap culture or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>

2254
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

2255
01:37:38.541 --> 01:37:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a Sikh and people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat your ass,</v>

2256
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:43.760
<v Speaker 1>far as the Muslims bombed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2257
01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not even near the same part of</v>

2258
01:37:47.151 --> 01:37:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck heads.</v>

2259
01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different headgear.</v>

2260
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 1>But to the person on the outside trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to categorize.</v>

2261
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make</v>

2262
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 3>sense of it.</v>

2263
01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.990
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the point is,</v>

2264
01:37:58.991 --> 01:38:01.900
<v Speaker 1>is that when you start to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that is about culture,</v>

2265
01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:02.943
<v Speaker 1>then you start to realize that race </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't actually matter and what you'll </v>

2266
01:38:05.741 --> 01:38:07.810
<v Speaker 1>find is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at,</v>

2267
01:38:07.811 --> 01:38:08.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asians,</v>

2268
01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:09.993
<v Speaker 1>Asians do very well in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very productive and all that </v>

2269
01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:15.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff except for the Hmong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2270
01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:17.930
<v Speaker 1>So there's a group of people called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmong and they're,</v>

2271
01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.980
<v Speaker 1>they're the big Asian exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2272
01:38:20.981 --> 01:38:22.600
<v Speaker 1>they do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hunters,</v>

2273
01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:24.580
<v Speaker 1>big time hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2274
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of violence,</v>

2275
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of education,</v>

2276
01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:30.933
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sort of fall into that sort </v>

2277
01:38:32.471 --> 01:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>of stereotype of becoming engineers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors and from what part of the world,</v>

2278
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>they're like Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

2279
01:38:38.171 --> 01:38:41.890
<v Speaker 1>like what used to be called Indochina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have their own country.</v>

2280
01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2281
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.093
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tribal grouping that sort of </v>

2282
01:38:44.891 --> 01:38:48.610
<v Speaker 1>exists across national boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in general,</v>

2283
01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great,</v>

2284
01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:50.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive forces in human history is </v>

2285
01:38:52.271 --> 01:38:53.710
<v Speaker 1>the British map maker.</v>

2286
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:56.583
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Europeans just love a straight </v>

2287
01:38:58.391 --> 01:38:59.224
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't get enough of the </v>

2288
01:39:01.991 --> 01:39:03.330
<v Speaker 1>straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were just like,</v>

2289
01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:04.443
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that the straight line works in </v>

2290
01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:09.070
<v Speaker 1>middle America because you've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out all the tribes.</v>

2291
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2292
01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.713
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't work so well in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are still tribes or </v>

2293
01:39:12.431 --> 01:39:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia where you suddenly start </v>
<v Speaker 1>like drawing a line,</v>

2294
01:39:15.431 --> 01:39:16.264
<v Speaker 1>right between two tribal groups or </v>
<v Speaker 1>across a tribal group and suddenly now </v>

2295
01:39:20.141 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 1>shit's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

2296
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:22.383
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having all these civil wars as they're </v>

2297
01:39:23.981 --> 01:39:25.600
<v Speaker 1>trying to unfuck the boundaries.</v>

2298
01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.170
<v Speaker 3>A straight lines are annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:30.063
<v Speaker 3>They all know it's really hilarious when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get busted for transporting </v>

2300
01:39:32.111 --> 01:39:35.800
<v Speaker 3>something across state lines like my </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to drive around with this or not</v>

2301
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:37.383
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the fucking law like if you have </v>

2302
01:39:39.161 --> 01:39:42.250
<v Speaker 3>pot in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you cross a state line,</v>

2303
01:39:42.251 --> 01:39:43.084
<v Speaker 3>you go from being someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent 100 percent to someone who's </v>

2304
01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.580
<v Speaker 3>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent of a felony.</v>

2305
01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:39:49.601 --> 01:39:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Well they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre.</v>

2307
01:39:51.071 --> 01:39:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean in one one side states' rights or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2308
01:39:54.490 --> 01:39:57.280
<v Speaker 3>an amazing idea for testing ideas out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2309
01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like testing out with like with Colorado</v>

2310
01:39:59.681 --> 01:40:01.390
<v Speaker 3>illegal legal marijuana again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2311
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.393
<v Speaker 3>Worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out great and people wouldn't </v>

2312
01:40:03.551 --> 01:40:04.660
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is working.</v>

2313
01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:06.250
<v Speaker 3>It's profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps everybody.</v>

2314
01:40:06.251 --> 01:40:06.971
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:40:06.971 --> 01:40:09.290
<v Speaker 3>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sold the idea to other pe.</v>

2316
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:10.363
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's other places like open </v>

2317
01:40:11.951 --> 01:40:16.660
<v Speaker 3>carry and you're like a hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>

2318
01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:18.370
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every concealed carry.</v>

2319
01:40:18.371 --> 01:40:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just have a gun on you.</v>

2320
01:40:19.721 --> 01:40:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the movie theater.</v>

2321
01:40:21.341 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2322
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:24.910
<v Speaker 1>But where are the places where that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true south?</v>

2323
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it's,</v>

2324
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:28.243
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to the what this is being </v>

2325
01:40:29.781 --> 01:40:30.614
<v Speaker 1>driven by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being driven by old cultural </v>

2326
01:40:31.791 --> 01:40:33.650
<v Speaker 1>baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily make sense.</v>

2327
01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's really,</v>

2328
01:40:35.781 --> 01:40:37.940
<v Speaker 1>in terms of honor cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are four books,</v>

2329
01:40:37.941 --> 01:40:40.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think that if you want to go into</v>

2330
01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:41.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't get angry at me,</v>

2331
01:40:41.781 --> 01:40:43.880
<v Speaker 1>just read the four books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those books,</v>

2332
01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.940
<v Speaker 1>those books are a black red necks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white liberals,</v>

2333
01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Souls Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture of honor,</v>

2334
01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 1>which is Richard Nisbett book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jd Vance's,</v>

2335
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:54.664
<v Speaker 1>hillbilly elegy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a book called the short and </v>

2336
01:40:57.461 --> 01:40:59.860
<v Speaker 1>tragic life of Robert Peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2337
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.053
<v Speaker 1>and those four books essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read those four books and you're </v>

2338
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:07.660
<v Speaker 1>still saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is unsubstantiated,</v>

2339
01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then we should talk about it.</v>

2340
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.593
<v Speaker 1>Or are there a lot of liberals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in arms and you propose these things </v>

2341
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:14.740
<v Speaker 1>start bringing up the hurt or culture?</v>

2342
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:15.573
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the Patriarchy and white </v>

2343
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:17.740
<v Speaker 1>racism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2344
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.633
<v Speaker 1>Know race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be racist towards white </v>

2345
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:20.704
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite things that </v>

2346
01:41:21.791 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 1>people are saying today that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be racist and white people.</v>

2347
01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of favorite things to say.</v>

2348
01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 1>People are saying a lot of weird and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky shit,</v>

2349
01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.453
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the wackiest like of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course you can like that's racism only </v>

2350
01:41:33.461 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 1>works when someone has power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2351
01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 1>when you racist to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have power over a period.</v>

2352
01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Cultural power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2353
01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Presumed across the board by black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

2354
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Like real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real simple.</v>

2355
01:41:43.661 --> 01:41:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Binary one or a zero.</v>

2356
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that what we're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that people?</v>

2357
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2358
01:41:48.621 --> 01:41:49.930
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

2359
01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Of course you can be racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could judge someone prejudice Lee.</v>

2360
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:53.943
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact that is the key thing with </v>

2361
01:41:56.051 --> 01:41:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nisbett book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture of honor.</v>

2362
01:41:58.330 --> 01:41:59.163
<v Speaker 1>So nesbitt was a professor in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties at the height of political </v>

2363
01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:02.734
<v Speaker 1>correctness and he wanted to study </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and the problem was that he's a </v>

2364
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:07.054
<v Speaker 1>white man from the south and he knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you studied any culture you </v>

2365
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:14.890
<v Speaker 1>would have to say bad things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does Richard Nesbitt do?</v>

2366
01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:16.420
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>

2367
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:19.930
<v Speaker 1>no one culture that I can say bad things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about on a college campus.</v>

2368
01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I can say bad things about southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

2369
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:27.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a culture I can criticize freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what he did,</v>

2370
01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:28.624
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I think gets really down to what </v>

2371
01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 1>are the strengths of know sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly northern and southern culture.</v>

2372
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2373
01:42:34.061 --> 01:42:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John F Kennedy had this great line about</v>

2374
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:37.294
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was a city of southern </v>

2375
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:44.320
<v Speaker 1>efficiency and northern charm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2376
01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2377
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2378
01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.553
<v Speaker 1>the potential for America is to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country of southern charm and northern </v>

2379
01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 1>efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're kind of got it backwards right</v>

2380
01:42:53.321 --> 01:42:54.154
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2381
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what,</v>

2382
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:58.990
<v Speaker 1>what Nesbitt is doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he's charming the liberals,</v>

2383
01:42:58.991 --> 01:43:00.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is what southerners do.</v>

2384
01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.950
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study culture,</v>

2385
01:43:02.951 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to study white southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and I'm going to show how bad it</v>

2386
01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:08.164
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2387
01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2388
01:43:09.521 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feels safe and comfortable.</v>

2389
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's essentially how he worked his</v>

2390
01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:17.830
<v Speaker 1>way into the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And specifically what he knew is he knew</v>

2391
01:43:17.831 --> 01:43:18.664
<v Speaker 1>that southern culture had this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular problem and this very </v>

2392
01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:22.503
<v Speaker 1>particular problem was that it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of homicide in very </v>

2393
01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:28.510
<v Speaker 1>specific categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had a higher rates of,</v>

2394
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2395
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:30.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically killings around trespassing </v>

2396
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:34.550
<v Speaker 1>and then killings around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2397
01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 1>lovers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangles.</v>

2398
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until 1970,</v>

2399
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 1>if you found your wife in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>another man in Texas,</v>

2400
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:43.623
<v Speaker 1>you could shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was justifiable homicide until </v>

2401
01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:50.110
<v Speaker 1>1970 isn't really only 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really recent.</v>

2402
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may,</v>

2403
01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2404
01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that's my recollection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2405
01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that might still be a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

2406
01:43:57.811 --> 01:44:00.780
<v Speaker 2>isn't there like a crime of passion law </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Texas?</v>

2407
01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there is for some reason,</v>

2408
01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.800
<v Speaker 1>well they may have just moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved the name or something.</v>

2409
01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

2410
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.190
<v Speaker 2>but I know that people have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>exonerated because of what,</v>

2411
01:44:12.191 --> 01:44:14.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes of passion because of like you're</v>

2412
01:44:14.261 --> 01:44:15.700
<v Speaker 2>allowed to get pissed off and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2413
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crime of passion,</v>

2414
01:44:17.861 --> 01:44:18.694
<v Speaker 2>legal definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is sometimes called the law of </v>

2415
01:44:20.831 --> 01:44:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Texas since injuries in that state or </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly lenient to cuckolded lovers.</v>

2416
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.843
<v Speaker 2>I love that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who reached their own vengeance or </v>

2417
01:44:28.781 --> 01:44:32.290
<v Speaker 2>rector on vengeance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The benefit of eliminating premeditation</v>

2418
01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.153
<v Speaker 2>is to lessen the provable homicide to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manslaughter with no death penalty and </v>

2419
01:44:36.551 --> 01:44:40.240
<v Speaker 2>limited prison terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's crimes of passion.</v>

2420
01:44:40.241 --> 01:44:45.241
<v Speaker 2>So it's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a much lesser crime.</v>

2421
01:44:45.630 --> 01:44:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think until [inaudible] 70,</v>

2422
01:44:47.071 --> 01:44:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it was actually just straight up </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifiable homicide,</v>

2423
01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:50.434
<v Speaker 1>so it was like straight up illegal crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>of passion and now it's like a homicide </v>

2424
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:55.890
<v Speaker 1>or manslaughter or go to jail for six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

2425
01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you get out,</v>

2426
01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 1>knows the fuck is up basically stay off </v>
<v Speaker 1>my property.</v>

2427
01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

2428
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:05.280
<v Speaker 1>It's that same psychology that plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2429
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Nesbitt and you know,</v>

2430
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:09.540
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by contrast in the north,</v>

2431
01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of what are called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more seven slash 11 murders,</v>

2432
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:15.240
<v Speaker 1>which are basically murders or </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental murders,</v>

2433
01:45:15.241 --> 01:45:17.640
<v Speaker 1>which is where people kill people trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get cash,</v>

2434
01:45:17.641 --> 01:45:18.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get rich,</v>

2435
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:19.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2436
01:45:19.771 --> 01:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>so there are these different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2437
01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's homicide in both places,</v>

2438
01:45:22.741 --> 01:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but there are different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>homicides that predominate.</v>

2439
01:45:25.530 --> 01:45:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And Nesbitt essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2440
01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:28.254
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big thing was to figure out why is </v>

2441
01:45:29.851 --> 01:45:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2442
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is that it's this culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>of honor that comes out of hurting.</v>

2443
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:36.263
<v Speaker 1>And so the irony is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that southerners who very often are </v>

2444
01:45:39.301 --> 01:45:43.560
<v Speaker 1>the ones who feel most strongly about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how problematic Muslims are,</v>

2445
01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:48.270
<v Speaker 1>have the same culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And honor killings,</v>

2446
01:45:48.271 --> 01:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>and they do all these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do it to the same extent.</v>

2447
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:52.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in general,</v>

2448
01:45:52.801 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 1>America is much less violent place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2449
01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>So much more violent than they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to adapt to the new culture.</v>

2450
01:45:58.891 --> 01:46:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is mad max style.</v>

2451
01:46:00.810 --> 01:46:01.643
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what would happen to all the </v>

2452
01:46:02.161 --> 01:46:06.510
<v Speaker 1>liberals and when your resources are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely limited,</v>

2453
01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:07.344
<v Speaker 1>like you live in a fucking desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to become even more </v>

2454
01:46:10.621 --> 01:46:11.580
<v Speaker 1>vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2455
01:46:11.581 --> 01:46:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You are protecting your boundaries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your property and your resources.</v>

2456
01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:15.713
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2457
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.903
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we straighten out the African </v>

2458
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:21.240
<v Speaker 2>American</v>

2459
01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about profit</v>

2460
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:27.290
<v Speaker 2>with crime and violence and terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere that they have to imitate.</v>

2461
01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point is,</v>

2462
01:46:28.711 --> 01:46:29.544
<v Speaker 1>is that the thing that allows people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move past their cultural baggage is </v>

2463
01:46:32.411 --> 01:46:33.244
<v Speaker 1>understanding their cultural baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's that answer of why it's </v>

2464
01:46:36.101 --> 01:46:36.934
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this in this environment because </v>

2465
01:46:40.331 --> 01:46:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are no longer in that environment.</v>

2466
01:46:43.181 --> 01:46:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Now it is problematic to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore it screws me up.</v>

2467
01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:50.910
<v Speaker 1>So now I should behave in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can start to retrain.</v>

2468
01:46:50.911 --> 01:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>What your impulses are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somebody bumps you,</v>

2469
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:55.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody comes on your land and your </v>

2470
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>first impulse is not to go grab your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shotgun and kill them.</v>

2471
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:00.263
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't worry so much of what it </v>

2472
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>comes down to because it's crucially </v>
<v Speaker 1>like their honor killings.</v>

2473
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:05.094
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those cultures are obsessed with </v>

2474
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:07.583
<v Speaker 1>honor and purge for particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you hear with African Americans is </v>

2475
01:47:10.021 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>don't dismiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't disrespect me,</v>

2476
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real policing of one's </v>

2477
01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 1>honor and really making sure that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucking with me.</v>

2478
01:47:18.361 --> 01:47:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2479
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 1>white rednecks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white southerners,</v>

2480
01:47:21.211 --> 01:47:23.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2481
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Texas pride don't mess with Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2482
01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.413
<v Speaker 1>nobody says Delaware pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because if you've been to </v>

2483
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:31.284
<v Speaker 1>Delaware there,</v>

2484
01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maine Pride,</v>

2485
01:47:34.091 --> 01:47:37.780
<v Speaker 3>all the dude love Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking poor do trapped up there.</v>

2486
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Frozen wasteland</v>

2487
01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.290
<v Speaker 1>with blueberries and lobster and Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>King and Steven King.</v>

2488
01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless him.</v>

2489
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:47.120
<v Speaker 1>He's up there for the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer and winters in Florida.</v>

2490
01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Snowbird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2492
01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.300
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>

2493
01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.510
<v Speaker 3>bad to not talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2494
01:47:56.511 --> 01:47:57.344
<v Speaker 3>So that is people that have the issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with even discussing the origins of </v>

2495
01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:01.784
<v Speaker 3>certain types of behavior and comparing </v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of black people and </v>

2496
01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:05.654
<v Speaker 3>different types of African Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out or African former </v>

2497
01:48:08.631 --> 01:48:09.464
<v Speaker 3>slaves like why did the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West indies behave differently than the </v>

2498
01:48:11.661 --> 01:48:12.494
<v Speaker 3>people in America and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it opens up this weird can of worms </v>

2499
01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:19.550
<v Speaker 3>where people are not willing to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>it openly and that's taboo</v>

2500
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:23.040
<v Speaker 1>and that is why so called his book black</v>
<v Speaker 1>redneck white liberals.</v>

2501
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:24.323
<v Speaker 1>Because the problem is that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>white liberals are not willing to </v>

2502
01:48:26.431 --> 01:48:27.264
<v Speaker 1>discuss these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening is that you get </v>

2503
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:31.520
<v Speaker 1>African pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2504
01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 1>It's and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Solo points out,</v>

2505
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:36.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was pride ever a good thing?</v>

2506
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pride is the feeling of that.</v>

2507
01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:40.650
<v Speaker 1>You know it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have nothing to learn.</v>

2508
01:48:40.651 --> 01:48:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that feeling of arrogance</v>

2509
01:48:42.570 --> 01:48:46.550
<v Speaker 3>or just have to be from mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2510
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:50.080
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't know about all that live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your daydreams.</v>

2511
01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:55.240
<v Speaker 3>England when you're a little shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived here.</v>

2512
01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.220
<v Speaker 3>18 in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2513
01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem and it is a problem.</v>

2514
01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:01.010
<v Speaker 1>There's just can't be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of culture.</v>

2515
01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:03.820
<v Speaker 1>They got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the.</v>

2516
01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.170
<v Speaker 1>What would the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the Siberian candidate.</v>

2517
01:49:06.190 --> 01:49:08.660
<v Speaker 1>What's Siberian tangible people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2518
01:49:08.661 --> 01:49:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is the Siberian candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

2519
01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:13.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about this whole </v>

2520
01:49:14.421 --> 01:49:15.254
<v Speaker 3>situation with Russia today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like that poor country </v>

2521
01:49:18.261 --> 01:49:22.100
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know how to fucking get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that one guy who's their main dude.</v>

2522
01:49:22.101 --> 01:49:24.830
<v Speaker 3>As much as Garry Kasparov talks about </v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at that hair.</v>

<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What is all that?</v>

2538
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:09.154
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including allegations that Russian </v>

2539

<v Speaker 3>operatives claimed to have compromising </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal and financial information about</v>

2540
01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>

2541
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:19.980
<v Speaker 3>multiple US officials with direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of the briefly tell CNN hm.</v>

2542
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.333
<v Speaker 3>The allegations were presented in a two </v>
<v Speaker 3>page synopsis that was at bended to </v>

2543
01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:27.940
<v Speaker 3>report on Russian intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 2016 election.</v>

2544
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:29.163
<v Speaker 3>The allegations came in part from memos </v>
<v Speaker 3>compiled by former British intelligence </v>

2545
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:35.530
<v Speaker 3>operative who was past work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>US intelligence,</v>

2546
01:50:35.610 --> 01:50:36.443
<v Speaker 3>Fisher officials or officials consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>credible the FBI's investigating the </v>

2547
01:50:39.701 --> 01:50:44.350
<v Speaker 3>credibility and accuracy of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>allegations which are based primarily on</v>

2548
01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:47.590
<v Speaker 3>information from Russian sources but has</v>
<v Speaker 3>not confirmed.</v>

2549
01:50:47.591 --> 01:50:50.290
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird time and it is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird time.</v>

2550
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 3>So fucking so crazy to think that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a cold war again.</v>

2551
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Like how did we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We duct that forever.</v>

2552
01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:57.603
<v Speaker 3>Like to the whole Clinton administration</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a nonissue through the entire </v>

2553
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:01.024
<v Speaker 3>Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Non Issue through the entire Obama </v>

2554
01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:07.210
<v Speaker 3>administration non fuck an issue until </v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 ish.</v>

2555
01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.160
<v Speaker 3>And then he started hearing about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2556
01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large part of what's happened is,</v>

2557
01:51:11.251 --> 01:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>is that our environment has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our culture has not.</v>

2558
01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2559
01:51:17.421 --> 01:51:19.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about the marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ideas,</v>

2560
01:51:19.251 --> 01:51:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you had these guys like Ed Rowe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward Armaro and Walter Cronkite,</v>

2561
01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and they had a thing called journalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity,</v>

2562
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brian Williams and Williams.</v>

2563
01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:31.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

2564
01:51:31.071 --> 01:51:33.120
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just as good as any of them.</v>

2565
01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That guy can tell a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2566
01:51:36.171 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2567
01:51:37.730 --> 01:51:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but journalistic integrity is now don </v>
<v Speaker 1>lemon.</v>

2568
01:51:40.730 --> 01:51:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step back,</v>

2569
01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:47.140
<v Speaker 1>step back and respect him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A set of check.</v>

2570
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:48.380
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know.</v>

2571
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:49.350
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

2572
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Czech people had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite things.</v>

2573
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever said on tv?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was talking about something?</v>

2574
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:57.970
<v Speaker 3>It was something about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was.</v>

2575
01:51:57.971 --> 01:51:58.804
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When don lemon was saying he had to </v>

2576
01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:01.624
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had to check some people in my </v>

2577
01:52:02.351 --> 01:52:03.184
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like people talk to talking </v>

2578
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:07.750
<v Speaker 3>sexist or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just telling people he had to</v>

2579
01:52:07.751 --> 01:52:09.940
<v Speaker 3>check people in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2580
01:52:09.941 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Don Lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You check checking anybody,</v>

2581
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:14.470
<v Speaker 3>anybody you'd check tells you to shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>your mouth.</v>

2582
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:15.843
<v Speaker 3>What's the funny part is I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in this report that just came </v>

2583
01:52:18.881 --> 01:52:20.470

<v Speaker 3>which is also going around now.</v>

2584

<v Speaker 3>I'll let you go ahead and read this </v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked in Russia with the American </v>

2615
01:53:56.821 --> 01:53:57.654
<v Speaker 1>secret service a long time ago and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that they found these listening </v>

2616
01:54:00.571 --> 01:54:01.404
<v Speaker 1>devices,</v>

2617
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:02.683
<v Speaker 2>it hidden inside buildings that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>powered by the movement of the building </v>

2618
01:54:06.501 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 2>during the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what they have their own.</v>

2619
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Their power source is literally the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building moving in.</v>

2620
01:54:14.661 --> 01:54:15.494
<v Speaker 2>The wind was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it was so far beyond anything </v>

2621
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:18.583
<v Speaker 2>that they had ever figured out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans had figured out at the time </v>

2622
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and they were just all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>surveillance.</v>

2623
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the things that the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union did well.</v>

2626
01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Union really put their attention on like</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and surveillance and you know,</v>

2627

<v Speaker 1>in the military and they did those very </v>

2628
01:54:37.111 --> 01:54:39.630

<v Speaker 1>Sounds like horseshit to me.</v>

2629

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2638
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:04.410
<v Speaker 1>shut the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

2639
01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.960
<v Speaker 1>The thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the report here.</v>

2640
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

2641
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the company intelligence report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:11.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a long report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presidential.</v>

2643
01:55:11.551 --> 01:55:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2644
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Go back up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain US presidential election,</v>

2645
01:55:14.881 --> 01:55:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Republican Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump's activity in Russia,</v>

2646
01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and compromising relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kremlin.</v>

2647
01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:19.763
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2648
01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:23.450
<v Speaker 1>A long pages and this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

2649
01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:25.750
<v Speaker 1>now we have to talk about golden showers</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent,</v>

2650
01:55:25.770 --> 01:55:26.603
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>

2651
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:29.150
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2652
01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.013
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know we've always known that </v>

2653
01:55:31.111 --> 01:55:34.560
<v Speaker 2>intelligence agencies will distribute </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>

2654
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:37.230
<v Speaker 2>We know that that's 100 percent factual,</v>

2655
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but that's the problem and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in general is this,</v>

2656
01:55:40.651 --> 01:55:41.484
<v Speaker 1>that like you know that the CIA engages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of behavior and of course you </v>

2657
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:48.030
<v Speaker 1>know that the FSB,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian security services engages in</v>

2658
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>that behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2659
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.240
<v Speaker 1>who do you trust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you trust?</v>

2660
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's the basic problem of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>

2661
01:55:54.511 --> 01:55:56.540
<v Speaker 1>100 percent who the trust.</v>

2662
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:58.223
<v Speaker 2>You got to know that if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone from any agency is telling </v>

2663
01:56:03.061 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you something and why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2664
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:09.090
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it serve them to tell you 100</v>

2665
01:56:09.091 --> 01:56:12.990
<v Speaker 2>percent the truth without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation whatsoever in order to gain</v>

2666
01:56:12.991 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>favor in order to gain influence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to gain.</v>

2667
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And what what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would the CIA have?</v>

2668
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Any motivation to be 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate about it?</v>

2669
01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2670
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2671
01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the CIA,</v>

2672
01:56:24.881 --> 01:56:28.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously Donald Trump is not clearly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend to the CIA.</v>

2673
01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already made it clear that he has </v>

2674
01:56:29.951 --> 01:56:30.784
<v Speaker 1>issues with the intelligence community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds so crazy because he's not </v>

2675
01:56:34.241 --> 01:56:35.240
<v Speaker 1>even in there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2676
01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.173
<v Speaker 1>And he hasn't been briefed by them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been rejecting that and I mean </v>

2677
01:56:39.371 --> 01:56:40.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the point we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2678
01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.570
<v Speaker 1>the old Chinese curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in interesting times.</v>

2679
01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when if he,</v>

2680
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:50.650
<v Speaker 2>if it comes out that there was a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of girls that he hired the piss all over</v>

2681
01:56:50.651 --> 01:56:51.484
<v Speaker 2>the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to cheer him on the </v>

2682
01:56:52.451 --> 01:56:53.284
<v Speaker 2>streets where people will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that loved them in the </v>

2683
01:56:56.261 --> 01:56:58.120
<v Speaker 2>first place and that's going to be a ton</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

2684
01:56:58.121 --> 01:57:00.370
<v Speaker 2>They're going to care as the guy had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good time.</v>

2685
01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2686
01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:03.220
<v Speaker 1>that's because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clan,</v>

2687
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:04.001
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2688
01:57:04.001 --> 01:57:04.834
<v Speaker 1>it is that culture of authority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grouping around and being loyal and all </v>

2689
01:57:07.961 --> 01:57:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2690
01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the big sort of conservative,</v>

2691
01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hillbilly redneck intuitions,</v>

2692
01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:16.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As opposed to liberals are like,</v>

2693
01:57:16.481 --> 01:57:18.880
<v Speaker 1>let's care for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's amazing,</v>

2694
01:57:18.881 --> 01:57:19.714
<v Speaker 1>let's not hurt anyone's feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have trophies for participation </v>

2695
01:57:22.121 --> 01:57:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for a long time,</v>

2696
01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:25.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberals have had a lot of power </v>

2697
01:57:26.261 --> 01:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>over the media and politics and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff.</v>

2698
01:57:28.571 --> 01:57:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the rabbit hole that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country went down and now you know,</v>

2699
01:57:32.621 --> 01:57:34.190
<v Speaker 1>the Conservatives have sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2700
01:57:34.210 --> 01:57:36.880
<v Speaker 1>gotten pissed off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2701
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>

2702
01:57:38.170 --> 01:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ideal situation,</v>

2703
01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:43.000
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats work like Mommy and Daddy,</v>

2704
01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:43.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2705
01:57:43.810 --> 01:57:44.643
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that mommy and daddy have it </v>

2706
01:57:46.571 --> 01:57:49.330
<v Speaker 1>all figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if mommy and daddy have a productive</v>

2707
01:57:49.331 --> 01:57:50.164
<v Speaker 1>working relationship than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the sort of like take personal </v>

2708
01:57:53.261 --> 01:57:54.550
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2709
01:57:54.551 --> 01:57:55.384
<v Speaker 1>man up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do all these sorts of things is </v>

2710
01:57:56.951 --> 01:58:00.790
<v Speaker 1>counteracted by a certain understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and all that sort of stuff.</v>

2711
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:01.803
<v Speaker 1>And then the parenting that emerges is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than what they would either of </v>

2712
01:58:04.091 --> 01:58:09.091
<v Speaker 1>them would do on their own or they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>both get dysfunctional as fuck and mommy</v>

2713
01:58:09.191 --> 01:58:10.900
<v Speaker 1>becomes an enabling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2714
01:58:10.901 --> 01:58:13.070
<v Speaker 1>snowflake machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2715
01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Daddy just becomes an abusive asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>who won't pay child support and just </v>

2716
01:58:17.531 --> 01:58:20.380
<v Speaker 1>berates his children and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

2717
01:58:20.381 --> 01:58:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Grow the fuck up on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on pussy.</v>

2718
01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really where America is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Mommy and daddy are fighting.</v>

2719
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:29.203
<v Speaker 1>And fundamentally like Mommy and daddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>are having the most dysfunctional </v>

2720
01:58:32.381 --> 01:58:32.950
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

2721
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Possible rushes are crazy neighbor who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2722
01:58:35.711 --> 01:58:37.900
<v Speaker 1>what a great opportunity to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck mommy.</v>

2723
01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2724
01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Russia trying to fart mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this nonsense.</v>

2725
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:45.573
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for Putin because what does </v>

2726
01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:47.764
<v Speaker 1>the Godfather want the godfather the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's important to understand </v>

2727
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:54.790
<v Speaker 1>like the disaster of American foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

2728
01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2729
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's because modern Americans have </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown up in,</v>

2730
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the most successful,</v>

2731
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.480
<v Speaker 1>most productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most stable country in history.</v>

2732
01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2733
01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2734
01:59:06.671 --> 01:59:07.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2735
01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:10.300
<v Speaker 1>as many generations into democracy as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

2736
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>there's not a real understanding of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to democracy,</v>

2737
01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just sort of inherited democracy and </v>

2738
01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:17.200
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2739
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.033
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he make one and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get these ridiculous fables that </v>

2740
01:59:20.681 --> 01:59:25.681
<v Speaker 1>Americans have about themselves where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that I'm essentially,</v>

2741
01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King George,</v>

2742
01:59:27.041 --> 01:59:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the third was this awful vicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictator and then we kicked the dictator</v>

2743
01:59:30.911 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 1>out and then democracy.</v>

2744
01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:33.513
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all you have to do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go in and you have to remove </v>

2745
01:59:35.951 --> 01:59:36.784
<v Speaker 1>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we just keep removing dictators </v>

2746
01:59:38.261 --> 01:59:40.120
<v Speaker 1>than democracy will emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2747
01:59:40.121 --> 01:59:42.790
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you remove Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hussein vacuum?</v>

2748
01:59:42.791 --> 01:59:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fills up with,</v>

2749
01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that delicious?</v>

2750
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

2751
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 1>you remove Kadafi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2752
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:53.670
<v Speaker 1>What happens vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I says,</v>

2754
01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.090
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these sorts of things.</v>

2755
01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.950
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big question that you know,</v>

2756
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:00.963
<v Speaker 1>that has always been in political </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and that Francis Fukuyama for </v>

2757
02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:04.121
<v Speaker 1>frames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that.</v>

2758
02:00:04.121 --> 02:00:04.954
<v Speaker 1>It's always been what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that the American revolution </v>

2759
02:00:07.691 --> 02:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>succeeded?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the French revolution descended into</v>

2760
02:00:10.811 --> 02:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>bloody violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

2761
02:00:13.381 --> 02:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>is that they were actually at two </v>
<v Speaker 1>different stages of development.</v>

2762
02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Incorrect answer is America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and French are bunch of pussies.</v>

2763
02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is correct.</v>

2764
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:30.460
<v Speaker 1>That's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fries and fries.</v>

2765
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Kick back and relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2766
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:33.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually the answer.</v>

2767
02:00:33.881 --> 02:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sorry I take back everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I said earlier.</v>

2768
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It is the blaming of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2769
02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:40.873
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily blaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understanding the root of the </v>

2770
02:00:42.841 --> 02:00:43.674
<v Speaker 2>behavior as being cultural and that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these ideologies that we become </v>

2771
02:00:49.861 --> 02:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>imprisoned to patterns of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we become prison too,</v>

2772
02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:54.563
<v Speaker 2>and that we're all subject to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone with an accent understands that </v>

2773
02:00:57.511 --> 02:00:59.910
<v Speaker 2>this is where it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we imitate behavior,</v>

2774
02:00:59.911 --> 02:01:00.744
<v Speaker 2>that it's around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we're in around an area like we </v>

2775
02:01:02.591 --> 02:01:07.410
<v Speaker 2>were talking about the Middle East with </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor resources and scarcity and a lot of</v>

2776
02:01:07.411 --> 02:01:08.244
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the type of behavior that we're </v>

2777
02:01:09.631 --> 02:01:11.250
<v Speaker 2>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to control our women,</v>

2778
02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.200
<v Speaker 2>dress them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover them up like beekeepers.</v>

2779
02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:14.213
<v Speaker 2>We got to keep them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them away from the other swinging </v>

2780
02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:16.134
<v Speaker 2>dicks that's fucking assholes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come over the hill with the </v>

2781
02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>sores and the horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2782
02:01:19.501 --> 02:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what's been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

2783
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:21.751
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2784
02:01:21.751 --> 02:01:22.584
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the craziest stories about Iraq </v>

2785
02:01:24.121 --> 02:01:24.954
<v Speaker 2>was a rackspace with Baghdad being </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded by the Mongols and then killing </v>

2786
02:01:29.071 --> 02:01:34.071
<v Speaker 2>everybody and running the streets raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>red with blood and black with ink in the</v>

2787
02:01:34.831 --> 02:01:35.664
<v Speaker 2>rivers would fucking be filled with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and all the from all these </v>

2788
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Islamic theorists and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2789
02:01:43.581 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different scholars who were far ahead of</v>

2790
02:01:48.231 --> 02:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>that aspect of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the part of the world at the</v>

2791
02:01:51.231 --> 02:01:52.130
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2792
02:01:52.131 --> 02:01:53.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much mathematics,</v>

2793
02:01:53.811 --> 02:01:55.720
<v Speaker 2>so much philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2794
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>so much knowledge came from that part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2795
02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.170
<v Speaker 2>It was totally lost when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded.</v>

2796
02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:02.080
<v Speaker 4>And so much of it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2797
02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:02.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old,</v>

2798
02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:03.603
<v Speaker 4>there's an old quote that floats around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that if Nobel prizes had been </v>

2799
02:02:06.461 --> 02:02:09.550
<v Speaker 4>given out in the year 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all would have gone to Arabs.</v>

2800
02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:12.520
<v Speaker 4>Amazing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were at the forefront and the point</v>

2801
02:02:12.521 --> 02:02:13.354
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that tells you something which is </v>

2802
02:02:14.230 --> 02:02:16.330
<v Speaker 4>that success is not a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>

2803
02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:17.373
<v Speaker 4>Bright cultures can gain it and cultures</v>
<v Speaker 4>can lose it and you better figure out </v>

2804
02:02:21.011 --> 02:02:21.844
<v Speaker 4>what is it that makes a culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful so you can preserve those </v>

2805
02:02:24.311 --> 02:02:25.870
<v Speaker 4>values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight for those values,</v>

2806
02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.100
<v Speaker 4>instilled them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spread them,</v>

2807
02:02:27.101 --> 02:02:28.150
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff.</v>

2808
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's why poop is jockeying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>power because he believes that there's a</v>

2809
02:02:32.671 --> 02:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>turnover going on right now and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hired a fucking reality star to run</v>

2810
02:02:36.661 --> 02:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>has ever known.</v>

2811
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This might be the time.</v>

2812
02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're there.</v>

2813
02:02:42.551 --> 02:02:45.150
<v Speaker 4>And that the instability that has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>created is,</v>

2814
02:02:45.151 --> 02:02:45.984
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2815
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:48.850
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gave everyone a microphone,</v>

2816
02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 4>that's what the Internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2817
02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:52.000
<v Speaker 4>We're literally sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2818
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:52.863
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can start a show and if people </v>

2819
02:02:54.581 --> 02:02:56.200
<v Speaker 4>resonate with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2820
02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.393
<v Speaker 4>And the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there are some people like you </v>

2821
02:02:59.170 --> 02:03:02.530
<v Speaker 4>who can hold two contradictory ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their head,</v>

2822
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.513
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you like wrestle with that and </v>

2823
02:03:05.261 --> 02:03:06.071
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2824
02:03:06.071 --> 02:03:08.410
<v Speaker 4>how do I make sense of both of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that,</v>

2825
02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.273
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism is fundamentally generates </v>

2826
02:03:11.801 --> 02:03:13.750
<v Speaker 4>wealth and prosperity and all that sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

2827
02:03:13.810 --> 02:03:16.000
<v Speaker 4>But corporations can do fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2828
02:03:16.001 --> 02:03:16.834
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I reconcile those two different </v>

2829
02:03:17.891 --> 02:03:20.440
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a whole bunch of people</v>

2830
02:03:20.441 --> 02:03:21.274
<v Speaker 4>out there on the Internet who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalists or who offer some sort </v>

2831
02:03:23.651 --> 02:03:24.484
<v Speaker 4>of very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very simple narrative that is very easy </v>

2832
02:03:27.011 --> 02:03:27.844
<v Speaker 4>for people to get and people can go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>go down the rabbit hole of their </v>

2833
02:03:31.301 --> 02:03:34.090
<v Speaker 4>prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can go down the rabbit hole of,</v>

2834
02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:35.133
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>caring and compassion in the end up at </v>

2835
02:03:36.551 --> 02:03:37.570
<v Speaker 4>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2836
02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Where people can go down the libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 4>rabbit hole of freedom.</v>

2837
02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:45.490
<v Speaker 4>And so they come up with this idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>called a narco capitalism and a narco.</v>

2838
02:03:45.491 --> 02:03:46.324
<v Speaker 4>Capitalism is the idea that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to remove all government and then </v>

2839
02:03:49.151 --> 02:03:53.320
<v Speaker 4>the free market will solve all problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's literally going to be minimal</v>

2840
02:03:53.321 --> 02:03:54.340
<v Speaker 4>or no government.</v>

2841
02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 2>They're the most annoying people there </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2842
02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.710
<v Speaker 2>of the most annoying people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that that's going to fall</v>

2843
02:04:00.711 --> 02:04:01.544
<v Speaker 2>to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that people aren't going </v>

2844
02:04:02.191 --> 02:04:03.024
<v Speaker 2>to fix the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the money for education coming </v>

2845
02:04:04.311 --> 02:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to hire cops?</v>

2846
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No laws at all.</v>

2847
02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2848
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:09.703
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I love particularly and so </v>

2849
02:04:10.341 --> 02:04:11.080
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2850
02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:11.913
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got into a big fight over the </v>

2851
02:04:13.401 --> 02:04:14.234
<v Speaker 4>Christmas holidays with a group of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>narco capitalists and it was literally </v>

2852
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:18.860
<v Speaker 4>because one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>

2853
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:21.560
<v Speaker 4>there were two things we interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this guy,</v>

2854
02:04:21.561 --> 02:04:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Peter Schiff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Peter Schiff is a liberal.</v>

2855
02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

2856
02:04:24.771 --> 02:04:27.370
<v Speaker 4>so I interviewed Peter Schiff and we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2857
02:04:27.450 --> 02:04:30.710
<v Speaker 4>part of the experience of doing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast with Brian Kaylin is,</v>

2858
02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:33.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we interviewed all these academics,</v>

2859
02:04:33.621 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred and six of them.</v>

2860
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at episode two,</v>

2861
02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:39.504
<v Speaker 4>Oh six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were two things that we sort of </v>

2862
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:41.574
<v Speaker 4>noticed a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were all these amazing ideas be </v>

2863
02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:45.413
<v Speaker 4>you would find that any academic knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>about his amazing idea and nobody </v>

2864
02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:50.253
<v Speaker 4>else's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we didn't know about anything else </v>

2865
02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 4>that was going on in science or anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2866
02:04:53.281 --> 02:04:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Or like Meryl Streep doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>MMA exactly.</v>

2867
02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's the Meryl Streep Effect,</v>

2868
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an academics are like,</v>

2869
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:02.063
<v Speaker 4>and it again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually comes out of sort of what </v>

2870
02:05:03.421 --> 02:05:07.370
<v Speaker 4>the Western cultural biases which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards this thing called atomism write.</v>

2871
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Like scientists are super focused on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>

2872
02:05:10.081 --> 02:05:12.630
<v Speaker 4>tiny question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't look for the bigger picture.</v>

2873
02:05:13.050 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 4>And we reached this frustration where </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially we were like,</v>

2874
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.050
<v Speaker 4>these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2875
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:19.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an old George Bernard Shaw joke </v>

2876
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:22.314
<v Speaker 4>about economists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said all the economists laid end to </v>

2877
02:05:24.271 --> 02:05:25.890
<v Speaker 4>end would never reach a conclusion.</v>

2878
02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:28.913
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing with academics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the academics laid end to end would </v>

2879
02:05:31.531 --> 02:05:32.364
<v Speaker 4>never reach a conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all this science that piles up </v>

2880
02:05:34.471 --> 02:05:36.180
<v Speaker 4>all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean?</v>

2881
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Like what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How should we live our lives?</v>

2882
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:40.650
<v Speaker 4>How do we solve the problems of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ghettos?</v>

2883
02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:43.050
<v Speaker 4>How do we solve the problems of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the Middle East?</v>

2884
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.033
<v Speaker 4>How do we solve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make liberals have some sort of </v>

2885
02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:48.270
<v Speaker 4>perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we do these things?</v>

2886
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's science should turn into </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical things.</v>

2887
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:54.060
<v Speaker 4>And in some areas it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2888
02:05:54.061 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a good sort of,</v>

2889
02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:56.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's physics has this adjacent </v>

2890
02:05:57.871 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 4>profession engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2891
02:05:59.371 --> 02:06:02.280
<v Speaker 4>and engineers go and they look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>laws of physics and they figured out how</v>

2892
02:06:02.281 --> 02:06:04.740
<v Speaker 4>to engineer quantum computers and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this other stuff,</v>

2893
02:06:04.770 --> 02:06:05.603
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you talk about the human </v>

2894
02:06:06.751 --> 02:06:07.584
<v Speaker 4>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the adjacent profession that's supposed </v>

2895
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:10.890
<v Speaker 4>to be there as storytelling.</v>

2896
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.370
<v Speaker 4>So there's what's called the science to </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative chain where you're supposed to</v>

2897
02:06:14.371 --> 02:06:16.390
<v Speaker 4>take science all of this research and </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to tell it,</v>

2898
02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 4>turn it into simple stories that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can understand and get,</v>

2899
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:20.303
<v Speaker 4>and there is in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to give you a sense of this </v>

2900
02:06:21.571 --> 02:06:22.404
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody knows that scientists </v>

2901
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:25.710
<v Speaker 4>aren't the best communicators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2902
02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Like the ones that are people like Neil </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrasse Tyson,</v>

2903
02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.423
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get on this show because you're </v>

2904
02:06:30.751 --> 02:06:31.381
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2905
02:06:31.381 --> 02:06:33.690
<v Speaker 4>a fucking scientists who can communicate</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a human,</v>

2906
02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 4>right or Carl Sagan or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2907
02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are fucking Unicorns,</v>

2908
02:06:37.621 --> 02:06:38.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very,</v>

2909
02:06:38.461 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 4>very rare in the scientific community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2910
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:42.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

2911
02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.150
<v Speaker 4>my very specific experience was I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2912
02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:48.090
<v Speaker 4>when I graduated from college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started tutoring just to pay my bills.</v>

2913
02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:49.253
<v Speaker 4>But I was really trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this weird experience where I </v>

2914
02:06:51.991 --> 02:06:55.140
<v Speaker 4>would be working with kids and I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear them say things like,</v>

2915
02:06:55.170 --> 02:06:56.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get the math gene.</v>

2916
02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:58.860
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that matching?</v>

2917
02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Because I was a biochemistry major,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm like,</v>

2918
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:01.583
<v Speaker 4>we met like you're 13 and failing </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology and you're telling me that you </v>

2919
02:07:06.751 --> 02:07:07.584
<v Speaker 4>have a math gene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just majored in biochemistry and </v>

2920
02:07:10.261 --> 02:07:12.240
<v Speaker 4>we don't know about any math gene over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2921
02:07:12.450 --> 02:07:16.080
<v Speaker 4>So what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone's telling them that some.</v>

2922
02:07:16.150 --> 02:07:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they're picking that up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting this idea.</v>

2923
02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:19.980
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Limited potential.</v>

2924
02:07:19.981 --> 02:07:24.120
<v Speaker 4>That's right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was a detective hunt that I went</v>

2925
02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:24.954
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was there is because there's a lot of </v>

2926
02:07:25.531 --> 02:07:26.364
<v Speaker 4>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a natural ear for </v>

2927
02:07:26.941 --> 02:07:27.780
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2928
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:30.000
<v Speaker 4>That's another big one we heard and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2929
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:33.000
<v Speaker 4>oh I'm not a natural writer and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of things.</v>

2930
02:07:33.210 --> 02:07:35.740
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are all these fucking beliefs?</v>

2931
02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I could tell that they were,</v>

2932
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.620
<v Speaker 4>they were problematic and that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>self defeating and specifically,</v>

2933
02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:42.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having moved between all of these </v>

2934
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:44.614
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd seen that different cultures have </v>

2935
02:07:45.911 --> 02:07:47.740
<v Speaker 4>very different ideas about intelligence.</v>

2936
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 4>So especially if you like my mother and </v>
<v Speaker 4>my father's side by side on the issue of</v>

2937
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:54.430
<v Speaker 4>learning languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad is Dutch.</v>

2938
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're Dutch,</v>

2939
02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:58.540
<v Speaker 4>you grew up with one great certainty in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2940
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:01.030
<v Speaker 4>which is that no one will ever fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>learn Dutch.</v>

2941
02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Like literally no one is ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking learn Dutch.</v>

2942
02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.720
<v Speaker 4>So if you want to get a job and you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be competitive,</v>

2943
02:08:07.930 --> 02:08:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you better learn literally everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>else's fucking language.</v>

2944
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.080
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's routine and Holland to speak three,</v>

2945
02:08:14.081 --> 02:08:15.670
<v Speaker 4>four languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2946
02:08:15.671 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 4>my dad spoke 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2947
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:19.960
<v Speaker 4>He studied 10 different languages his in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his life.</v>

2948
02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:21.160
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2949
02:08:21.161 --> 02:08:21.994
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually there anybody who comes </v>

2950
02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 4>from a lot of these minority languages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of smaller,</v>

2951
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:28.000
<v Speaker 4>shittier languages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find they do this.</v>

2952
02:08:28.001 --> 02:08:30.640
<v Speaker 4>So polls routinely learn a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>

2953
02:08:30.850 --> 02:08:33.550
<v Speaker 4>People from Southeast Asia routinely </v>
<v Speaker 4>learn a lot of languages.</v>

2954
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:34.660
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that environment,</v>

2955
02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:38.890
<v Speaker 4>like you lost the language lottery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so you better make up for it,</v>

2956
02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.300
<v Speaker 4>like you're just going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2957
02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And at a certain point when you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned three or four languages,</v>

2958
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:44.770
<v Speaker 4>it's now like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2959
02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:46.450
<v Speaker 4>you've sussed this thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2960
02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:47.920
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get how this works.</v>

2961
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:49.023
<v Speaker 4>Like this is just about work and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are certain techniques and certain </v>

2962
02:08:50.861 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 4>approaches you start to get really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at it.</v>

2963
02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:53.883
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2964
02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:54.793
<v Speaker 4>I really sort of from my dad picked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>this love of learning languages and my </v>

2965
02:08:57.701 --> 02:08:58.530
<v Speaker 4>dad is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2966
02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:00.370
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially into languages,</v>

2967
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.233
<v Speaker 4>like every time they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't really like school and every </v>

2968
02:09:03.461 --> 02:09:05.380
<v Speaker 4>time they would tell him he had to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>another subject,</v>

2969
02:09:05.590 --> 02:09:08.890
<v Speaker 4>he would look up another language take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

2970
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:12.550
<v Speaker 4>he ended up taking Swedish because in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sixties and seventies,</v>

2971
02:09:12.551 --> 02:09:13.384
<v Speaker 4>all the pornos were made in Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to know what they were saying </v>

2972
02:09:18.041 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 4>between sexual thrust.</v>

2973
02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

2974
02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:22.293
<v Speaker 4>So he learned Swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He learns all these fucking weird </v>

2975
02:09:24.131 --> 02:09:24.791
<v Speaker 4>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2976
02:09:24.791 --> 02:09:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2977
02:09:26.111 --> 02:09:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you need me to take another class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do something that I enjoy,</v>

2978
02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pretty normal sense.</v>

2979
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:31.833
<v Speaker 4>But then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom's from Kansas and in Kansas they </v>

2980
02:09:34.961 --> 02:09:38.110
<v Speaker 4>don't speak foreign languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not the thing that's done.</v>

2981
02:09:38.111 --> 02:09:39.970
<v Speaker 4>And so there would be this experience of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2982
02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:40.804
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took Japanese in high school and I </v>

2983
02:09:42.191 --> 02:09:43.030
<v Speaker 4>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2984
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:44.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'd go like,</v>

2985
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who are you?</v>

2986
02:09:47.441 --> 02:09:50.140
<v Speaker 4>And you've taken Latin and ancient Greek</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

2987
02:09:50.141 --> 02:09:52.690
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2988
02:09:52.691 --> 02:09:55.570
<v Speaker 4>so you're moving between these two </v>
<v Speaker 4>different environments and you're like,</v>

2989
02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.093
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the issue here is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just think about languages in different </v>

2990
02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know that it's,</v>

2991
02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:05.770
<v Speaker 4>that you have different potentially you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just have different attitudes to it.</v>

2992
02:10:05.850 --> 02:10:06.683
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hearing all these kids say all these </v>

2993
02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.234
<v Speaker 4>bizarre things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time I was doing a tutoring </v>

2994
02:10:13.001 --> 02:10:13.834
<v Speaker 4>company with a friend of mine from </v>
<v Speaker 4>college who is from New England and you </v>

2995
02:10:17.081 --> 02:10:17.914
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the New England is that pure and </v>

2996
02:10:18.741 --> 02:10:19.541
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2997
02:10:19.541 --> 02:10:20.374
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2998
02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 4>all self-denial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fun work hard,</v>

2999
02:10:23.561 --> 02:10:27.010
<v Speaker 4>all of that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she also heard all of these weird and</v>

3000
02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:30.060
<v Speaker 4>wacky beliefs and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3001
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.800
<v Speaker 4>reacted in the puritan way possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

3002
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:36.470
<v Speaker 4>you're just being fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like fucking like do your fucking work.</v>

3003
02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:37.940
<v Speaker 4>No excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3004
02:10:37.941 --> 02:10:41.930
<v Speaker 4>It's not Boston attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so prevalent attitude.</v>

3005
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3006
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:46.130
<v Speaker 4>you've got this Bostonian and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got this half Dutch,</v>

3007
02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 4>half American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3008
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:49.310
<v Speaker 4>lived with the limeys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3009
02:10:49.311 --> 02:10:50.490
<v Speaker 4>all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3010
02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:52.850
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're the outsiders.</v>

3011
02:10:52.851 --> 02:10:54.260
<v Speaker 4>It's that experience that you talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3012
02:10:54.261 --> 02:10:55.094
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foreigners who come to America or </v>

3013
02:10:56.001 --> 02:10:56.570
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

3014
02:10:56.570 --> 02:11:00.280
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this culture of La is fucking weird.</v>

3015
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what brought you here?</v>

3016
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3017
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:05.240
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to move to the west </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast.</v>

3018
02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:05.991
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3019
02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:06.824
<v Speaker 4>I watched triggered last night and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>agree with you that California is the </v>

3020
02:11:09.501 --> 02:11:13.010
<v Speaker 4>best place on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but particularly because,</v>

3021
02:11:13.011 --> 02:11:13.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3022
02:11:13.761 --> 02:11:14.594
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is the what part of what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>found like a lot of what I was reacting </v>

3023
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:18.531
<v Speaker 4>against,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3024
02:11:18.531 --> 02:11:21.470
<v Speaker 4>You leave places [inaudible] there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you don't like and then you go</v>

3025
02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:22.304
<v Speaker 4>to the most opposite place you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I didn't like the culture of </v>

3026
02:11:25.191 --> 02:11:27.080
<v Speaker 4>England,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like aristocracy,</v>

3027
02:11:27.081 --> 02:11:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like that whole class system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hated it.</v>

3028
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:31.363
<v Speaker 4>And then when I went to Boston and New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York I felt like there was still a lot </v>

3029
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:35.354
<v Speaker 4>of that sort of hierarchy and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that La is the place where it's like </v>

3030
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:43.520
<v Speaker 4>nobody gives a fuck where you come from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there isn't that hierarchy,</v>

3031
02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:45.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that sort of stuff.</v>

3032
02:11:45.201 --> 02:11:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the wild west.</v>

3033
02:11:46.611 --> 02:11:47.444
<v Speaker 4>And I love that.</v>

3034
02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.530
<v Speaker 3>It definitely isn't a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to me,</v>

3035
02:11:49.531 --> 02:11:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the last place that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know they landed on the east coast,</v>

3036
02:11:53.401 --> 02:11:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they made their way to the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3037
02:11:55.231 --> 02:11:57.300
<v Speaker 3>well I don't want to live in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what it was.</v>

3038
02:11:57.420 --> 02:11:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's litter.</v>

3039
02:11:58.621 --> 02:12:01.440
<v Speaker 3>And the people that did move to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why.</v>

3040
02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean I fucking love Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I love about it is</v>

3041
02:12:04.831 --> 02:12:06.300
<v Speaker 3>the ex pats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that go,</v>

3042
02:12:06.301 --> 02:12:07.380
<v Speaker 3>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

3043
02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just out here now.</v>

3044
02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:10.980
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

3045
02:12:11.010 --> 02:12:11.843
<v Speaker 4>that's the culture that I always wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a part of was the culture that </v>

3046
02:12:15.031 --> 02:12:16.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck cares,</v>

3047
02:12:16.831 --> 02:12:19.650
<v Speaker 4>like we're done with that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Hawaii is too much.</v>

3048
02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3049
02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:20.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3050
02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:22.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean I probably should have gone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii.</v>

3051
02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:24.813
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems like now it's more viable </v>

3052
02:12:26.021 --> 02:12:28.490
<v Speaker 3>than ever before because the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3053
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:33.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just pretty much access evenly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything other than what's immediately</v>

3054
02:12:33.491 --> 02:12:34.324
<v Speaker 3>in your area.</v>

3055
02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:35.343
<v Speaker 4>But also engine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think also it's important to talk </v>

3056
02:12:37.211 --> 02:12:39.490
<v Speaker 4>about like how do humans actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3057
02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:41.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's often that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3058
02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:43.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a large part of what comes out of the</v>

3059
02:12:43.481 --> 02:12:45.790
<v Speaker 4>sciences that thinking and feeling are </v>
<v Speaker 4>always linked.</v>

3060
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:46.863
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're often driven by feelings </v>

3061
02:12:47.951 --> 02:12:50.140
<v Speaker 4>that we can't quite explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3062
02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.033
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3063
02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:56.040
<v Speaker 4>the why was I also motivated by La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there was some attraction to the</v>

3064
02:12:56.291 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 4>entertainment industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

3065
02:12:58.271 --> 02:13:00.400
<v Speaker 4>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really,</v>

3066
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:01.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're being really honest,</v>

3067
02:13:01.991 --> 02:13:04.960
<v Speaker 4>like why the fuck do you make any </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision that you make when you're 22,</v>

3068
02:13:04.961 --> 02:13:05.794
<v Speaker 4>23?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3069
02:13:05.850 --> 02:13:06.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just,</v>

3070
02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.073
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's some sort of cultural </v>

3071
02:13:08.921 --> 02:13:12.070
<v Speaker 4>baggage that's driving you there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They watch Baywatch like.</v>

3072
02:13:12.071 --> 02:13:12.904
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have some sort of fantasy </v>

3073
02:13:14.081 --> 02:13:16.920
<v Speaker 4>version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the Bible Moskovitz a shower where</v>

3074
02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:19.273
<v Speaker 4>you think there are no cats in Los </v>
<v Speaker 4>Angeles and the streets are paved with </v>

3075
02:13:22.031 --> 02:13:24.310
<v Speaker 4>cheese and then you get out here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3076
02:13:24.370 --> 02:13:26.140
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking scientologists </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

3077
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3078
02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:28.473
<v Speaker 3>Well Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I wanted </v>

3079
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:34.630
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you about before we get get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you about your,</v>

3080
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:37.420
<v Speaker 3>your calling Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientologists.</v>

3081
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3082
02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.610
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the larger.</v>

3083
02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:40.473
<v Speaker 4>So you've now gotten a taste of some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that are going on across </v>

3084
02:13:43.121 --> 02:13:44.260
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3085
02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.790
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of really exciting stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can actually change and improve and</v>

3086
02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:49.900
<v Speaker 4>help people's lives.</v>

3087
02:13:50.230 --> 02:13:51.063
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I think that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed out that's incredibly critical </v>

3088
02:13:53.590 --> 02:13:58.330
<v Speaker 3>is that to or in order to be at the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your field,</v>

3089
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:59.583
<v Speaker 3>you must be completely absorbed in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular subject and oftentimes a lot </v>

3090
02:14:03.851 --> 02:14:04.684
<v Speaker 3>like all the other systems that we find </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have limited resources and you </v>

3091
02:14:08.051 --> 02:14:08.884
<v Speaker 3>really don't have the time or the energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even the inclination to study all </v>

3092
02:14:12.341 --> 02:14:17.341
<v Speaker 3>these other comparable systems or </v>
<v Speaker 3>different disciplines or it's like,</v>

3093
02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

3094
02:14:20.021 --> 02:14:21.340
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many examples of that,</v>

3095
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:24.520
<v Speaker 3>but singular focus is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which usually leads to greatness.</v>

3096
02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:27.430
<v Speaker 3>And when you're reading about some </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors,</v>

3097
02:14:27.431 --> 02:14:29.530
<v Speaker 3>peer reviewed work that's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>groundbreaking,</v>

3098
02:14:29.770 --> 02:14:32.530
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you're dealing with a form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

3099
02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>And that requires massive tunnel vision.</v>

3100
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the interesting thing.</v>

3101
02:14:37.231 --> 02:14:39.150
<v Speaker 4>So we should talk about what tunnel </v>
<v Speaker 4>vision is,</v>

3102
02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

3103
02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:43.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as we have optimism and pessimism,</v>

3104
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:45.660
<v Speaker 4>there are these other two mindsets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>atomism in holism,</v>

3105
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:49.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And atomism is the seeing the tree,</v>

3106
02:14:49.230 --> 02:14:50.063
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like ignore the fucking forest and </v>

3107
02:14:51.571 --> 02:14:52.404
<v Speaker 4>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to look at that one fucking </v>

3108
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:55.620
<v Speaker 4>tree and become the world's expert in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3109
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:57.840
<v Speaker 4>And then there's whole ism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is seeing the big picture,</v>

3110
02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 4>seeing the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing all that sort of stuff.</v>

3111
02:15:00.230 --> 02:15:01.063
<v Speaker 4>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has these mindsets but </v>

3112
02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:05.550
<v Speaker 4>different cultures favor than </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently,</v>

3113
02:15:05.551 --> 02:15:06.384
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the environmental pressures </v>

3114
02:15:07.591 --> 02:15:08.424
<v Speaker 4>of that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Greeks massively favored atomism </v>

3115
02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:14.420
<v Speaker 4>and if you look at the behavior of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greeks,</v>

3116
02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:15.423
<v Speaker 4>the ancient Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were constantly picking everything </v>

3117
02:15:16.681 --> 02:15:17.514
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3118
02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Because they were pirates pirates and </v>
<v Speaker 4>traders and fishermen.</v>

3119
02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:22.523
<v Speaker 4>And in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not about cooperation or anything </v>

3120
02:15:25.201 --> 02:15:25.710
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3121
02:15:25.710 --> 02:15:26.543
<v Speaker 4>It's about everybody just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead for themselves and all that sort </v>

3122
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:30.000
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very individualistic.</v>

3123
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:31.103
<v Speaker 4>All of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when they would have leisure </v>

3124
02:15:33.181 --> 02:15:35.250
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were the things they did?</v>

3125
02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go and they would go into the</v>

3126
02:15:37.081 --> 02:15:37.914
<v Speaker 4>marketplace and they would argue with </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and pick apart each other's </v>

3127
02:15:39.991 --> 02:15:41.670
<v Speaker 4>arguments and they would just pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>

3128
02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:42.001
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>

3129
02:15:42.001 --> 02:15:42.391
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>

3130
02:15:42.391 --> 02:15:43.224
<v Speaker 4>pick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what logic is and rhetoric </v>

3131
02:15:44.551 --> 02:15:45.920
<v Speaker 4>and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3132
02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:47.730
<v Speaker 4>and then they would also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3133
02:15:47.731 --> 02:15:48.564
<v Speaker 4>when they had other leisure time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go and see who could throw </v>

3134
02:15:51.031 --> 02:15:52.530
<v Speaker 4>shit furthest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3135
02:15:52.531 --> 02:15:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Like who run fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about standing out.</v>

3136
02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:58.350
<v Speaker 4>It's all about trying to excel and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best.</v>

3137
02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.760
<v Speaker 4>And what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

3138
02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the is during the renaissance,</v>

3139
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:02.730
<v Speaker 4>that they</v>

3140
02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.073
<v Speaker 3>say that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>renascence and they sold in America </v>

3141
02:16:08.341 --> 02:16:10.730
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3142
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:12.010
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

3143
02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:12.870
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

3144
02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:13.733
<v Speaker 3>what is the American way I want to fit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in genaissance renaissance renaissance </v>

3145
02:16:16.190 --> 02:16:19.080
<v Speaker 3>renaissance Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like the renaissance faire,</v>

3146
02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Patty Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paris,</v>

3147
02:16:21.930 --> 02:16:23.520
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say France,</v>

3148
02:16:23.550 --> 02:16:25.360
<v Speaker 3>not France from France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3149
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:27.690
<v Speaker 3>I just have to really channel my inner </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas.</v>

3150
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:31.953
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever you want to fucking call the </v>

3151
02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:34.170
<v Speaker 4>rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rebirth,</v>

3152
02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:35.133
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They basically were obsessed with the </v>

3153
02:16:36.881 --> 02:16:37.714
<v Speaker 4>Greeks and the Romans were obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Greeks and then when the rebirth or </v>

3154
02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:42.833
<v Speaker 4>assaults happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were obsessed with the Romans and </v>

3155
02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:45.544
<v Speaker 4>the Greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they became obsessed with this </v>

3156
02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:48.724
<v Speaker 4>culture and that's how you start to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>this culture of individualism that </v>

3157
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:52.354
<v Speaker 4>develops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The founding fathers were obsessed with </v>

3158
02:16:54.071 --> 02:16:54.904
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that becomes a lot of the spirit </v>

3159
02:16:56.831 --> 02:16:58.030
<v Speaker 4>of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3160
02:16:58.031 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Is this real atomistic culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

3161
02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.220
<v Speaker 4>over in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3162
02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.440
<v Speaker 4>They have different incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is rice farming.</v>

3163
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:07.930
<v Speaker 4>And so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that rice farming is,</v>

3164
02:17:07.931 --> 02:17:10.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be super cooperative because</v>

3165
02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:13.300
<v Speaker 4>the water runs down the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it runs through my patty field,</v>

3166
02:17:13.301 --> 02:17:15.730
<v Speaker 4>but then it runs through your neighbor's</v>
<v Speaker 4>patty field and all that sort of stuff.</v>

3167
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:16.743
<v Speaker 4>So I have to have relations with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighbor and that neighbor and then I </v>

3168
02:17:19.541 --> 02:17:20.374
<v Speaker 4>have to think about how it affects the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next guy and the next guy and the next </v>

3169
02:17:21.791 --> 02:17:22.624
<v Speaker 4>guy and the next guy.</v>

3170
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:26.080
<v Speaker 4>So they favor whole ism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does everything fit together?</v>

3171
02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 4>And so if you look at what is Eastern </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture about,</v>

3172
02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:31.750
<v Speaker 4>what are those ancient Asian culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3173
02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:32.793
<v Speaker 4>it's all about Yin and Yang things </v>
<v Speaker 4>fitting together and complimenting it </v>

3174
02:17:35.741 --> 02:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being part of a larger system.</v>

3175
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:38.583
<v Speaker 4>And Confucianism was all about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>family and relationships and everybody </v>

3176
02:17:41.591 --> 02:17:42.424
<v Speaker 4>has their proper role and you all sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of have to belong and all of that sort </v>

3177
02:17:45.461 --> 02:17:46.294
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3178
02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:52.020
<v Speaker 4>So which set of biases do you think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>science has baked into it's culture?</v>

3179
02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Adam is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what,</v>

3180
02:17:55.210 --> 02:17:58.900
<v Speaker 4>when you get the structure of scientific</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture as it stands today,</v>

3181
02:17:59.050 --> 02:18:04.050
<v Speaker 4>it's super atomistic right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at things like economics and</v>

3182
02:18:04.211 --> 02:18:05.044
<v Speaker 4>psychology and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>biology and all of these sorts of </v>

3183
02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:08.974
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all studying the natural world </v>

3184
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 4>and in fact there's a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines that are all studying humans</v>

3185
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:17.710
<v Speaker 4>and how they behave and all that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and yet they're all broken up into</v>

3186
02:18:17.711 --> 02:18:18.544
<v Speaker 4>separate disciplines and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of doubling down on those </v>

3187
02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:22.624
<v Speaker 4>intuitions and they're now breaking up </v>
<v Speaker 4>those disciplines into subdisciplines </v>

3188
02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:26.163
<v Speaker 4>and smaller disciplines and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines and left to their own </v>

3189
02:18:28.271 --> 02:18:28.780
<v Speaker 4>devices.</v>

3190
02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.360
<v Speaker 4>They'll just keep splitting up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting smaller and smaller.</v>

3191
02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:33.160
<v Speaker 4>And where does feminism fit in all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

3192
02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the but that,</v>

3193
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.651
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3194
02:18:35.651 --> 02:18:36.620
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3195
02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:37.473
<v Speaker 4>what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that as you get smaller and smaller </v>

3196
02:18:40.181 --> 02:18:41.014
<v Speaker 4>and smaller disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it doesn't necessarily make the </v>

3197
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:47.260
<v Speaker 4>science better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can make the science worse.</v>

3198
02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:50.680
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why it makes a science </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's the easiest way to understand</v>

3199
02:18:50.681 --> 02:18:52.990
<v Speaker 4>it is the story of the blind men and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>elephant.</v>

3200
02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is an old story about from India</v>

3201
02:18:55.991 --> 02:18:56.824
<v Speaker 4>about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a group of blind men decide come </v>

3202
02:18:58.991 --> 02:19:00.700
<v Speaker 4>along and they decided to figure out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>elephant.</v>

3203
02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:02.860
<v Speaker 4>So this what this thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3204
02:19:02.861 --> 02:19:03.694
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what's an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first one comes up and he feels </v>

3205
02:19:05.561 --> 02:19:06.394
<v Speaker 4>the tail and he feels the end of it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels a little hairs at the end he </v>

3206
02:19:08.021 --> 02:19:09.640
<v Speaker 4>says it's a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3207
02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:10.473
<v Speaker 4>And the second one goes along and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>feels the trunk and it rides in his </v>

3208
02:19:12.821 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 4>hands and he jumps back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>startled and he's like,</v>

3209
02:19:14.501 --> 02:19:15.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3210
02:19:15.731 --> 02:19:17.980
<v Speaker 4>And the third one feels the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks it's a column.</v>

3211
02:19:17.981 --> 02:19:20.140
<v Speaker 4>The fourth one feels the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks it's a wall,</v>

3212
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:21.153
<v Speaker 4>and then the fifth one feels the ear and</v>
<v Speaker 4>decides that it's a palm leaf and then </v>

3213
02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:25.953
<v Speaker 4>they all proceed to beat the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>other because clearly everybody else is </v>

3214
02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:29.444
<v Speaker 4>a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they need to die because they know </v>

3215
02:19:31.941 --> 02:19:33.320
<v Speaker 4>that it's a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a snake.</v>

3216
02:19:33.321 --> 02:19:35.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a wall,</v>

3217
02:19:35.031 --> 02:19:37.820
<v Speaker 4>it's a column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is right now,</v>

3218
02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:41.480
<v Speaker 4>if you look at something like feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3219
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Feminism is making certain claims about </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology,</v>

3220
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's making claims about how male gender</v>

3221
02:19:47.181 --> 02:19:49.010
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how female gender works,</v>

3222
02:19:49.210 --> 02:19:50.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be looking at things like </v>

3223
02:19:50.781 --> 02:19:52.820
<v Speaker 4>genetics and they should be looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3224
02:19:52.890 --> 02:19:53.723
<v Speaker 4>chromosomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they should be looking at evolution </v>

3225
02:19:56.271 --> 02:19:59.840
<v Speaker 4>to see how evolution might've selected </v>
<v Speaker 4>for differences in men and women because</v>

3226
02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 4>there are different competing pressures </v>
<v Speaker 4>for men and women.</v>

3227
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:04.490
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go into,</v>

3228
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:06.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual science,</v>

3229
02:20:06.141 --> 02:20:08.540
<v Speaker 4>you'll find that there's actually lots </v>
<v Speaker 4>of science about that.</v>

3230
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:09.913
<v Speaker 4>But what's happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that feminism has become its own </v>

3231
02:20:11.841 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 4>tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3232
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:18.110
<v Speaker 4>And as a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it rejects the findings of other tribes,</v>

3233
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:19.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

3234
02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:24.131
<v Speaker 4>if I go into the circles of feminism or </v>
<v Speaker 4>sociology or any other tribe,</v>

3235
02:20:25.731 --> 02:20:27.110
<v Speaker 4>and I start talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3236
02:20:27.111 --> 02:20:29.480
<v Speaker 4>the evidence of some other tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3237
02:20:29.481 --> 02:20:30.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't count,</v>

3238
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:32.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to rationalize it away.</v>

3239
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:36.320
<v Speaker 4>And so now we're no longer grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

3240
02:20:36.470 --> 02:20:37.303
<v Speaker 4>And what we can do is we can take that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tail and we can convince ourselves that </v>

3241
02:20:40.911 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3242
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Because we're not accountable to all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these other fields that surrounding it.</v>

3243
02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Does it make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3244
02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 4>So what if you want to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

3245
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:52.580
<v Speaker 4>what you have to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you have to make each discipline</v>

3246
02:20:52.581 --> 02:20:54.680
<v Speaker 4>accountable to all the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines.</v>

3247
02:20:54.890 --> 02:20:59.090
<v Speaker 4>You have to make people responsive to </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence outside of their field.</v>

3248
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:02.150
<v Speaker 4>So if you take someone like Richard </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins,</v>

3249
02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:03.013
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has Richard Dawkins gone down his </v>

3250
02:21:05.061 --> 02:21:08.620
<v Speaker 4>particular rabbit hole of figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3251
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:10.910
<v Speaker 4>his tiny piece of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3252
02:21:10.911 --> 02:21:12.710
<v Speaker 4>he has done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what makes you think that?</v>

3253
02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you.</v>

3254
02:21:14.241 --> 02:21:15.074
<v Speaker 4>So in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're going to find is that </v>

3255
02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:19.520
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of different fields,</v>

3256
02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:23.060
<v Speaker 4>you're going to find that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 4>competing theories right now.</v>

3257
02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.370
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look in economics,</v>

3258
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:28.040
<v Speaker 4>there's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3259
02:21:28.041 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 4>there's sort of what are called </v>
<v Speaker 4>classical economics,</v>

3260
02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they have this idea called rational </v>

3261
02:21:32.361 --> 02:21:33.194
<v Speaker 4>agent theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they basically think it's a </v>

3262
02:21:34.881 --> 02:21:38.270
<v Speaker 4>reasonable approximation to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are rational,</v>

3263
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:39.133
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they act is rational individuals </v>

3264
02:21:40.371 --> 02:21:41.204
<v Speaker 4>and all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then meanwhile there's another </v>

3265
02:21:43.491 --> 02:21:45.530
<v Speaker 4>school called behavioral economics.</v>

3266
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 4>And because of Daniel Kahneman and Amos </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tversky,</v>

3267
02:21:48.291 --> 02:21:51.680
<v Speaker 4>who were these two Israeli psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 seventies who started to study</v>

3268
02:21:51.681 --> 02:21:53.830
<v Speaker 4>human rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3269
02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure this will come as a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>surprise,</v>

3270
02:21:55.941 --> 02:21:58.630
<v Speaker 4>but what they found is that humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't that rational,</v>

3271
02:21:58.960 --> 02:21:59.793
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there was a group of economists </v>

3272
02:22:02.391 --> 02:22:03.650
<v Speaker 4>who say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3273
02:22:03.651 --> 02:22:07.130
<v Speaker 4>our whole discipline is based on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of rational agent theory,</v>

3274
02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:11.480
<v Speaker 4>but when we look at psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that assumption doesn't check out and it</v>

3275
02:22:11.481 --> 02:22:13.490
<v Speaker 4>leads to a whole bunch of bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusions.</v>

3276
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:17.120
<v Speaker 4>So they formed a new school of economics</v>
<v Speaker 4>called behavioral economics,</v>

3277
02:22:17.121 --> 02:22:19.910
<v Speaker 4>which is based on all the findings of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology,</v>

3278
02:22:19.911 --> 02:22:22.400
<v Speaker 4>how humans actually think and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>

3279
02:22:22.850 --> 02:22:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Now these two schools are warring right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3280
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:25.883
<v Speaker 4>two fighting tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what ends up happening is that they </v>

3281
02:22:29.221 --> 02:22:30.054
<v Speaker 4>can't solve that discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't solve that in the context of </v>

3282
02:22:33.781 --> 02:22:34.614
<v Speaker 4>academia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3283
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:38.100
<v Speaker 4>The fire papers back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of discussions are had and all that</v>

3284
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:38.934
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But essentially you have a recurring </v>

3285
02:22:41.311 --> 02:22:45.300
<v Speaker 4>problem in science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that scientists won't let go of</v>

3286
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:48.540
<v Speaker 4>their pet theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't let their theories die.</v>

3287
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.823
<v Speaker 4>And Max Planck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physicists had this famous quote </v>

3288
02:22:51.931 --> 02:22:54.480
<v Speaker 4>that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science proceeds one funeral at a time.</v>

3289
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:55.603
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and essentially what happens is it </v>

3290
02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:59.610
<v Speaker 4>science doesn't progress because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3291
02:22:59.611 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>

3292
02:23:00.661 --> 02:23:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new evidence came out.</v>

3293
02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:03.563
<v Speaker 4>Turns out I was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm going to change my mind because </v>

3294
02:23:06.841 --> 02:23:07.674
<v Speaker 4>it's their theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they keep on fighting for and </v>

3295
02:23:10.321 --> 02:23:12.030
<v Speaker 4>defending their theory until they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>

3296
02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:14.500
<v Speaker 4>And then the discipline is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3297
02:23:14.501 --> 02:23:15.221
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that,</v>

3298
02:23:15.221 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 4>that guy's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously that was dumb all along,</v>

3299
02:23:18.330 --> 02:23:20.460
<v Speaker 4>let's move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

3300
02:23:20.461 --> 02:23:23.220
<v Speaker 4>So ego becomes this sort of trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge problem.</v>

3301
02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Huge problem for science in general.</v>

3302
02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.930
<v Speaker 4>And so if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3303
02:23:27.931 --> 02:23:30.650
<v Speaker 4>that rational agent theory dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3304
02:23:30.651 --> 02:23:31.484
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one of the big founders of </v>

3305
02:23:32.371 --> 02:23:34.530
<v Speaker 4>behavioral economics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Guy Richard Thaler,</v>

3306
02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:36.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>

3307
02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:37.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tells a great story and the story is </v>

3308
02:23:38.881 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 4>that he's at a dinner party and at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinner party,</v>

3309
02:23:42.121 --> 02:23:46.050
<v Speaker 4>there's this famous economists from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole rational agent theory camp.</v>

3310
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:48.030
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3311
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 4>there's also like a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>academics like a psychologist.</v>

3312
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.690
<v Speaker 4>And so the guy who believes in rational </v>
<v Speaker 4>agent theories going on and on about how</v>

3313
02:23:54.691 --> 02:23:56.820
<v Speaker 4>fucking dumb people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3314
02:23:56.821 --> 02:23:59.820
<v Speaker 4>how irrational they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's going on about his own wife.</v>

3315
02:23:59.821 --> 02:24:01.800
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife is so irrational.</v>

3316
02:24:02.010 --> 02:24:06.720
<v Speaker 4>She just bought a new car but she won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive it and that makes no sense because</v>

3317
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:09.330
<v Speaker 4>she's worried about digging it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's already paid for the car.</v>

3318
02:24:09.331 --> 02:24:12.240
<v Speaker 4>She should use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God humans are so irrational.</v>

3319
02:24:12.270 --> 02:24:16.470
<v Speaker 4>And then he goes and my students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my students are so fucking dumb,</v>

3320
02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:17.363
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't even understand the most </v>

3321
02:24:18.211 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 4>basic economic concepts and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>

3322
02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:24.330
<v Speaker 4>And so the psychologist pipes up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

3323
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:29.010
<v Speaker 4>how come all the people in your theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>are geniuses?</v>

3324
02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:32.280
<v Speaker 4>But all the people you know in real life</v>
<v Speaker 4>are idiots.</v>

3325
02:24:32.970 --> 02:24:36.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem for your theory,</v>

3326
02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:37.433
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because your ubs observations about </v>

3327
02:24:39.331 --> 02:24:44.331
<v Speaker 4>reality do not fit your theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what does this guy do?</v>

3328
02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Does this guy say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3329
02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fall on my sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to throw out 30,</v>

3330
02:24:49.231 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 4>40 years of work on a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3331
02:24:51.541 --> 02:24:52.374
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead what he does is he does what </v>

3332
02:24:54.211 --> 02:24:55.044
<v Speaker 4>Richard Thaler calls the invisible hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>wave where he proceeds to wave his hand </v>

3333
02:24:58.441 --> 02:24:59.221
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3334
02:24:59.221 --> 02:25:01.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be some irrationality,</v>

3335
02:25:01.861 --> 02:25:02.400
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3336
02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:03.233
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>

3337
02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:08.040
<v Speaker 4>But in the end markets sort things out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3338
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.230
<v Speaker 4>he's rationalizing scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalized.</v>

3339
02:25:10.231 --> 02:25:11.064
<v Speaker 4>Humans rationalized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to defend their own most </v>

3340
02:25:13.021 --> 02:25:15.780
<v Speaker 4>cherished ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's not.</v>

3341
02:25:15.810 --> 02:25:19.260
<v Speaker 4>This is not a problem of Richard Dawkins</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a problem of humans.</v>

3342
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:20.423
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if humans have power and </v>

3343
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 4>intellectual power as a form of power </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not checked,</v>

3344
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 4>they will continue to rationalize their </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad ideas.</v>

3345
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:29.530
<v Speaker 4>So specifically what bad ideas is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dawkins rationalizing?</v>

3346
02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's the,</v>

3347
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3348
02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:36.700
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual dispute is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the 19 sixties there was this idea</v>

3349
02:25:37.961 --> 02:25:38.794
<v Speaker 4>of group selection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was very fuzzy and it was a </v>

3350
02:25:40.841 --> 02:25:42.880
<v Speaker 4>shitty version of group selection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3351
02:25:42.881 --> 02:25:43.714
<v Speaker 4>Which is the idea that natural selection</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens not only at the level of genes </v>

3352
02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:49.360
<v Speaker 4>but also at the level of human groups </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea that selection is happening</v>

3353
02:25:49.361 --> 02:25:49.901
<v Speaker 4>at many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

3354
02:25:49.901 --> 02:25:52.120
<v Speaker 4>many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Dawkins,</v>

3355
02:25:52.121 --> 02:25:55.780
<v Speaker 4>in 1976 writes this big important book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the selfish gene,</v>

3356
02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:00.400
<v Speaker 4>and it's basically that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't need group selection to make sense</v>

3357
02:26:00.401 --> 02:26:01.390
<v Speaker 4>of a lot of behavior.</v>

3358
02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:03.340
<v Speaker 4>You can just use what's called kin </v>
<v Speaker 4>selection.</v>

3359
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:04.503
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might do something nice for your </v>

3360
02:26:05.951 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 4>sister or you might potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3361
02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.033
<v Speaker 4>die to save your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can make sense of that at the </v>

3362
02:26:11.591 --> 02:26:14.010
<v Speaker 4>level of genes because essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3363
02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.110
<v Speaker 4>your sister's shares many of the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>genes.</v>

3364
02:26:16.111 --> 02:26:16.944
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need this idea that groups </v>

3365
02:26:18.461 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3366
02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.650
<v Speaker 4>since then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happened is,</v>

3367
02:26:22.651 --> 02:26:23.484
<v Speaker 4>is that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a large part of what the </v>

3368
02:26:25.901 --> 02:26:26.734
<v Speaker 4>problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that some people read that book </v>

3369
02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:29.793
<v Speaker 4>including Jeff Skilling and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>concluded that what that means is that </v>

3370
02:26:34.181 --> 02:26:38.890
<v Speaker 4>the way to get ahead is to be selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Skilling is the CEO of Enron,</v>

3371
02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:41.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll hear in business circles,</v>

3372
02:26:41.381 --> 02:26:43.690
<v Speaker 4>you'll hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of like,</v>

3373
02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:44.793
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about law of the jungle killer </v>

3374
02:26:45.810 --> 02:26:47.920
<v Speaker 4>be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you get ahead,</v>

3375
02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:49.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>survival of the fittest.</v>

3376
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:50.343
<v Speaker 4>So it's confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So exactly from their ideas about guts </v>

3377
02:26:53.801 --> 02:26:55.150
<v Speaker 4>repeating in business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3378
02:26:55.570 --> 02:26:58.690
<v Speaker 4>And know that's what scaling probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to believe.</v>

3379
02:26:58.691 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 4>And so he read Dawkins' book and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3380
02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:01.773
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I have intellectual credibility for </v>

3381
02:27:04.151 --> 02:27:04.984
<v Speaker 4>what I wanted to do anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so skilling runs and ron based on </v>

3382
02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:12.490
<v Speaker 4>those ideas and what has this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he said what at Skilling.</v>

3383
02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.001
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3384
02:27:13.001 --> 02:27:14.800
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he said that he based it on Docklands</v>

3385
02:27:14.801 --> 02:27:15.281
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3386
02:27:15.281 --> 02:27:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I said that the selfish gene was his </v>
<v Speaker 4>favorite book.</v>

3387
02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:18.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3388
02:27:18.690 --> 02:27:19.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to find out,</v>

3389
02:27:19.841 --> 02:27:22.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly everything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>skilling his son,</v>

3390
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.160
<v Speaker 4>but he said it was his favorite book and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is in general a big problem.</v>

3391
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:29.950
<v Speaker 4>Science is the big magic of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3392
02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:30.843
<v Speaker 4>Like it's if you want to justify like </v>
<v Speaker 4>feminists when they try and justify </v>

3393
02:27:33.791 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 4>their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the sort of feminists who try and say</v>

3394
02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:39.670
<v Speaker 4>that gender doesn't matter and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>social constructs,</v>

3395
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:42.250
<v Speaker 4>they try and do it all in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

3396
02:27:42.250 --> 02:27:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the Nazi youth,</v>

3397
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what sometimes to the point to,</v>

3398
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:47.680
<v Speaker 4>well they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3399
02:27:47.681 --> 02:27:49.990
<v Speaker 4>some sort of idea of culture or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3400
02:27:50.170 --> 02:27:51.003
<v Speaker 4>But these other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ideas that masquerade as </v>

3401
02:27:52.571 --> 02:27:53.470
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3402
02:27:53.471 --> 02:27:55.960
<v Speaker 4>So you know the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eugenics movement,</v>

3403
02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:57.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Nazis that was,</v>

3404
02:27:57.970 --> 02:28:02.380
<v Speaker 4>that was based on some sort of idea that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought was science at the time,</v>

3405
02:28:02.610 --> 02:28:05.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Soviets had this guy loves Sanko who</v>

3406
02:28:05.501 --> 02:28:08.070
<v Speaker 4>was the opposite and he believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3407
02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:09.093
<v Speaker 4>genes could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he thought you could literally </v>

3408
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.943
<v Speaker 4>shock and electrocute seeds to make them</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what you wanted them to do because </v>

3409
02:28:15.041 --> 02:28:17.080
<v Speaker 4>jeans didn't really matter and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>all conditioning,</v>

3410
02:28:17.410 --> 02:28:18.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>

3411
02:28:18.970 --> 02:28:20.360
<v Speaker 4>behaviorism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3412
02:28:20.470 --> 02:28:21.303
<v Speaker 4>Was bf skinner's idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the idea that it was all </v>

3413
02:28:23.541 --> 02:28:26.030
<v Speaker 4>stimulus response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human mind didn't exist.</v>

3414
02:28:26.031 --> 02:28:27.830
<v Speaker 4>There were no beliefs and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3415
02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of the way that education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3416
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:31.394
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the educational pace choices </v>

3417
02:28:32.301 --> 02:28:34.880
<v Speaker 4>that were made in the fifties were based</v>
<v Speaker 4>on skinner's ideas,</v>

3418
02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:37.070
<v Speaker 4>which then fucks up a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

3419
02:28:37.310 --> 02:28:38.143
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either what ends up happening is that </v>

3420
02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:40.304
<v Speaker 4>either science is applied or it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>misapplied or misinterpreted or people </v>

3421
02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:45.673
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read a particular scientific study and </v>

3422
02:28:46.941 --> 02:28:49.540
<v Speaker 4>don't have the context on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>

3423
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:52.880
<v Speaker 4>these bad ideas permeate and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>applied and all of that sort of stuff.</v>

3424
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the debate,</v>

3425
02:28:54.651 --> 02:28:57.410
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>around rational agent theory is not some</v>

3426
02:28:57.411 --> 02:28:58.910
<v Speaker 4>act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is an academic debate,</v>

3427
02:28:59.270 --> 02:29:01.010
<v Speaker 4>but in addition to being an academic </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate,</v>

3428
02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:04.280
<v Speaker 4>economists apply those ideas and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3429
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:08.740
<v Speaker 4>the public needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the public wants it's experts and its</v>

3430
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 4>leaders to make the right decision than </v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to hold them accountable on their</v>

3431
02:29:11.601 --> 02:29:12.434
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

3432
02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:14.270
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3433
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:15.920
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have,</v>

3434
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:19.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science also has to police who has their</v>

3435
02:29:19.071 --> 02:29:20.390
<v Speaker 4>backing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3436
02:29:20.391 --> 02:29:21.224
<v Speaker 4>And it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a responsibility to communicate </v>

3437
02:29:22.851 --> 02:29:23.684
<v Speaker 4>to the public what is the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific understanding available </v>

3438
02:29:27.051 --> 02:29:27.884
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Skilling takes the selfish gene and </v>

3439
02:29:30.891 --> 02:29:31.724
<v Speaker 4>he runs with that and clearly that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that was very popular in the </v>

3440
02:29:34.491 --> 02:29:36.140
<v Speaker 4>seventies and eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the me generation,</v>

3441
02:29:36.141 --> 02:29:36.974
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that selfish gene sort of slots into </v>

3442
02:29:40.011 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 4>a culture that is already sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for that to be true.</v>

3443
02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it lends this credibility.</v>

3444
02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what has happened is that the </v>

3445
02:29:49.881 --> 02:29:50.714
<v Speaker 4>science has now moved on to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this idea of multilevel selection </v>

3446
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:55.754
<v Speaker 4>theory and a lot of what we've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about today in terms of how </v>

3447
02:29:58.191 --> 02:30:02.240
<v Speaker 4>groups work and how culture works is all</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on those ideas and there's a whole</v>

3448
02:30:02.241 --> 02:30:03.074
<v Speaker 4>group of academics and a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different disciplines that have these </v>

3449
02:30:05.691 --> 02:30:06.524
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

3450
02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:08.670
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are people like John Height,</v>

3451
02:30:09.470 --> 02:30:12.380
<v Speaker 4>people like Joe Henrich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like David Sloan Wilson who's the</v>

3452
02:30:12.381 --> 02:30:17.381
<v Speaker 4>big multilevel selection guy and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you put all of theirs or Daniel Conaman,</v>

3453
02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:19.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amos Tversky,</v>

3454
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:21.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the list goes on and on and on.</v>

3455
02:30:21.021 --> 02:30:23.570
<v Speaker 4>But when you put all of these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

3456
02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:26.330
<v Speaker 4>you get a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really compelling narrative.</v>

3457
02:30:26.810 --> 02:30:27.643
<v Speaker 4>Now doc and says that his work was </v>
<v Speaker 4>misinterpreted and that I'm essentially </v>

3458
02:30:33.231 --> 02:30:34.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3459
02:30:34.071 --> 02:30:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Skilling misunderstood his work now</v>
<v Speaker 4>doc and says very clearly in the selfish</v>

3460
02:30:38.781 --> 02:30:41.930
<v Speaker 4>gene that our nature is selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3461
02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:42.883
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems pretty clear that I don't </v>

3462
02:30:44.871 --> 02:30:46.760
<v Speaker 4>know that Jeff Skilling entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>misinterpreted,</v>

3463
02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.013
<v Speaker 4>but what David Sloan Wilson and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>multilevel selection people are saying </v>

3464
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:53.540
<v Speaker 4>something very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An eo Wilson said this as well,</v>

3465
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:54.613
<v Speaker 4>which is that altruism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>selfish individuals be altruistic </v>

3466
02:30:57.801 --> 02:30:58.634
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but altruistic groups beat selfish </v>

3467
02:31:00.981 --> 02:31:03.710
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you want to get ahead,</v>

3468
02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:04.753
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get ahead by being a selfish </v>

3469
02:31:05.841 --> 02:31:07.940
<v Speaker 4>asshole and fucking everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3470
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:09.523
<v Speaker 4>But if you have a group that is based on</v>
<v Speaker 4>selfishness and you're trying to fuck </v>

3471
02:31:12.681 --> 02:31:13.514
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your group is going gonna fall </v>

3472
02:31:15.021 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 4>apart and it's going to lose out to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>altruistic group.</v>

3473
02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:22.650
<v Speaker 4>So if you compare side by side accompany</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Enron and accompany like Pixar,</v>

3474
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:24.480
<v Speaker 4>which you can read about and Creativity </v>
<v Speaker 4>Inc,</v>

3475
02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:27.240
<v Speaker 4>you're going to find that they have two </v>
<v Speaker 4>very different environments,</v>

3476
02:31:27.241 --> 02:31:28.074
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pixar is fundamentally a cooperative </v>

3477
02:31:29.881 --> 02:31:32.040
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a high trust environment.</v>

3478
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Everybody works together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3479
02:31:33.901 --> 02:31:34.734
<v Speaker 4>all of that sort of stuff and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable company that year after </v>

3480
02:31:37.771 --> 02:31:38.604
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turns out great films and does great </v>

3481
02:31:39.781 --> 02:31:40.614
<v Speaker 4>work and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Ron is a toxic environment because </v>

3482
02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:47.400
<v Speaker 4>everybody is just trying to get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no I in team,</v>

3483
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:50.370
<v Speaker 4>they're just fucking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the thing blows up.</v>

3484
02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:51.893
<v Speaker 4>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science has a responsibility to </v>

3485
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:57.270
<v Speaker 4>communicate clearly and what should </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

3486
02:31:57.360 --> 02:32:00.360
<v Speaker 4>I think in terms of our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not blowing the fuck up,</v>

3487
02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:00.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3488
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:05.270
<v Speaker 4>In terms of corporations not engaging in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of toxic behavior is,</v>

3489
02:32:05.271 --> 02:32:06.104
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3490
02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't have the authority because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>

3491
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:11.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can't come out and say this is what</v>

3492
02:32:11.701 --> 02:32:12.930
<v Speaker 4>science is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3493
02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:13.933
<v Speaker 4>there is literally no human alive today </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can come out and say what science </v>

3494
02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:20.550
<v Speaker 4>is because people can only come out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>speak about their tiny field.</v>

3495
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:21.623
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no consistent message from </v>

3496
02:32:22.741 --> 02:32:23.574
<v Speaker 4>science especially don't understand what</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins is arguing against because </v>

3497
02:32:26.041 --> 02:32:29.050
<v Speaker 4>didn't he also argue for cooperation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this book?</v>

3498
02:32:29.051 --> 02:32:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Like wasn't one of the chapters of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

3499
02:32:30.691 --> 02:32:32.550
<v Speaker 4>Nice guys finish first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3500
02:32:32.551 --> 02:32:36.630
<v Speaker 4>but he refuses to acknowledge this idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>of group that group selection happens,</v>

3501
02:32:36.631 --> 02:32:38.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's refusing to acknowledge like,</v>

3502
02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:41.190
<v Speaker 4>what is this is actual statements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is he?</v>

3503
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:42.173
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the larger academic debate is </v>

3504
02:32:44.701 --> 02:32:45.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3505
02:32:45.541 --> 02:32:49.440
<v Speaker 4>so specifically he rejects the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3506
02:32:49.441 --> 02:32:50.274
<v Speaker 4>and it's important to realize that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>group selection people are not denying </v>

3507
02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:56.190
<v Speaker 4>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're not denying Dawkins is work,</v>

3508
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.203
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're building off of is work and </v>

3509
02:32:58.441 --> 02:33:01.140
<v Speaker 4>saying there's this extra effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3510
02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:03.660
<v Speaker 4>But how do they describe that extra </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect?</v>

3511
02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:06.150
<v Speaker 4>They described that effect as selfish </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

3512
02:33:06.170 --> 02:33:07.003
<v Speaker 4>outcompete altruistic individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>altruistic groups compete selfish </v>

3513
02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:10.014
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3514
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

3515
02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:13.650
<v Speaker 4>if you were to have Richard Dawkins in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this room today,</v>

3516
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:15.300
<v Speaker 4>he would not agree with that statement,</v>

3517
02:33:16.970 --> 02:33:17.803
<v Speaker 4>what would he think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would say that selection does not </v>

3518
02:33:20.001 --> 02:33:21.290
<v Speaker 4>happen at the level of groups.</v>

3519
02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:23.773
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3520
02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:27.630
<v Speaker 4>And will be the evidence pro and con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3521
02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:28.553
<v Speaker 4>ultimately what I would like Joe and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why I called him a scientologist </v>

3522
02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:35.220
<v Speaker 4>is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should happen in academic debate is</v>

3523
02:33:35.221 --> 02:33:37.320
<v Speaker 4>that ideas should die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3524
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:38.663
<v Speaker 4>The point of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of scientific progress is that you </v>

3525
02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:42.420
<v Speaker 4>should live and die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3526
02:33:42.421 --> 02:33:46.500
<v Speaker 4>It's Thunderdome to ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enter one ideas leave right now,</v>

3527
02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.050
<v Speaker 4>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that that's not happening in science.</v>

3528
02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:49.913
<v Speaker 4>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened to that dinner party with </v>

3529
02:33:51.241 --> 02:33:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Richard Thaler is two ideas entered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>two ideas left,</v>

3530
02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:56.730
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in general,</v>

3531
02:33:56.731 --> 02:33:58.580
<v Speaker 4>that's a big recurring problem in </v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

3532
02:33:58.581 --> 02:34:03.180
<v Speaker 4>It's happening in economics and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>also happening in evolutionary biology.</v>

3533
02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:05.460
<v Speaker 4>Now the point is is that I'm a single </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

3534
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:06.383
<v Speaker 4>I can't be an expert in all the nuances </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the details of all of these </v>

3535
02:34:10.621 --> 02:34:11.454
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I can do is I can show you the </v>

3536
02:34:13.501 --> 02:34:14.334
<v Speaker 4>general pattern that's happening and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can show you what the consequences are </v>

3537
02:34:17.651 --> 02:34:18.484
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

3538
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:19.503
<v Speaker 4>Have these beliefs not changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the area in which I do know the most </v>

3539
02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:26.830
<v Speaker 4>right is the area of education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have some daughters,</v>

3540
02:34:26.831 --> 02:34:28.270
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

3541
02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:29.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these beliefs that your daughters </v>

3542
02:34:31.541 --> 02:34:34.600
<v Speaker 4>have about their intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever those beliefs may be,</v>

3543
02:34:34.601 --> 02:34:35.434
<v Speaker 4>as of today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will have a huge effect on the choices </v>

3544
02:34:37.241 --> 02:34:38.980
<v Speaker 4>they make in school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The choice,</v>

3545
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:41.830
<v Speaker 4>how they do in education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what their experience of school is,</v>

3546
02:34:41.831 --> 02:34:43.750
<v Speaker 4>whether they are happy in school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're productive,</v>

3547
02:34:43.751 --> 02:34:44.584
<v Speaker 4>whether they're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and whether they're setup for a </v>

3548
02:34:46.271 --> 02:34:48.790
<v Speaker 4>knowledge economy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was all about constantly learning.</v>

3549
02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:49.953
<v Speaker 4>Do they emerge from school hating school</v>
<v Speaker 4>or did they emerge from school loving </v>

3550
02:34:52.121 --> 02:34:52.954
<v Speaker 4>school?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they emerge from school with </v>

3551
02:34:53.711 --> 02:34:54.544
<v Speaker 4>confidence that they can learn what has </v>
<v Speaker 4>there ever is required or do they feel </v>

3552
02:34:56.861 --> 02:34:59.320
<v Speaker 4>like they can only be good at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and not good at other things?</v>

3553
02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:00.243
<v Speaker 2>Before we get too far off track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed I'm still confused as to </v>

3554
02:35:02.741 --> 02:35:07.510
<v Speaker 2>how you feel Dawkins is ignoring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments against his work.</v>

3555
02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3556
02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:09.013
<v Speaker 2>What are his statement?</v>

3557
02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:11.690
<v Speaker 4>He's denied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's denied this idea of group</v>

3558
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:16.120
<v Speaker 2>since anybody had a debate with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this secret and watch somewhere.</v>

3559
02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen</v>

3560
02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:16.860
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3561
02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:19.230
<v Speaker 4>there have been debates and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what has happened is,</v>

3562
02:35:19.231 --> 02:35:21.810
<v Speaker 4>is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like for example,</v>

3563
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:23.383
<v Speaker 4>what the debate is currently is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate is currently about how many </v>

3564
02:35:26.461 --> 02:35:29.190
<v Speaker 4>people are on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So John Height,</v>

3565
02:35:29.191 --> 02:35:30.024
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was on Sam Harris' podcast and Sam </v>

3566
02:35:31.950 --> 02:35:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Harris would agree with Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3567
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:35.560
<v Speaker 4>And John Height,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3568
02:35:35.561 --> 02:35:36.900
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Heightened Sam Harris,</v>

3569
02:35:36.901 --> 02:35:38.790
<v Speaker 4>disagree on multiple things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3570
02:35:38.850 --> 02:35:39.683
<v Speaker 4>They've had many disagreements in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole point of their podcast was to try </v>

3571
02:35:41.551 --> 02:35:43.710
<v Speaker 4>and have a civil conversation and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3572
02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:45.030
<v Speaker 4>John Height said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3573
02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>the difference between you and Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I,</v>

3574
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:47.783
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I'm an intuitionist in euro </v>

3575
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:50.100
<v Speaker 4>rationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3576
02:35:50.101 --> 02:35:51.300
<v Speaker 4>So Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

3577
02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:54.060
<v Speaker 4>John Height believes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you look across the science,</v>

3578
02:35:54.061 --> 02:35:54.894
<v Speaker 4>I think this is what supported is that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thief thinking and feeling are always </v>

3579
02:35:58.291 --> 02:35:59.124
<v Speaker 4>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're always being driven by these </v>

3580
02:35:59.761 --> 02:36:02.760
<v Speaker 4>intuitions even if we don't always </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that there is,</v>

3581
02:36:02.761 --> 02:36:04.530
<v Speaker 4>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of descartes' error,</v>

3582
02:36:04.531 --> 02:36:06.450
<v Speaker 4>which is the idea that descartes came up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

3583
02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:09.270
<v Speaker 4>The reason and emotion are separate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of.</v>

3584
02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:12.210
<v Speaker 4>That's what the rational agent theories </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the idea that,</v>

3585
02:36:12.211 --> 02:36:13.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's reason and it's,</v>

3586
02:36:13.621 --> 02:36:16.710
<v Speaker 4>it's separate from emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are these mutually incompatible though?</v>

3587
02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3588
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Then that's the point of science is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to kill certain ideas.</v>

3589
02:36:21.151 --> 02:36:24.730
<v Speaker 4>So while there's descartes' error </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically comes from A.</v>

3590
02:36:24.810 --> 02:36:25.643
<v Speaker 4>There's this book by Antonio Damasio at </v>
<v Speaker 4>USC and it's based on a series of </v>

3591
02:36:28.021 --> 02:36:30.660
<v Speaker 4>experiments around this guy named Elliot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people like him.</v>

3592
02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:35.790
<v Speaker 4>And so elliot was this banker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>financial guy,</v>

3593
02:36:35.791 --> 02:36:37.620
<v Speaker 4>happy family man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this sort of stuff,</v>

3594
02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:42.360
<v Speaker 4>and he had a brain tumor and so they </v>
<v Speaker 4>chopped it out.</v>

3595
02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:43.373
<v Speaker 4>The brain tumor was right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right up at the top of the base of his </v>

3596
02:36:45.511 --> 02:36:48.120
<v Speaker 4>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at first it seemed like chopping out</v>

3597
02:36:48.121 --> 02:36:50.100
<v Speaker 4>this piece of his brain had done </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

3598
02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:51.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hadn't effected him.</v>

3599
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.931
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

3600
02:36:51.931 --> 02:36:52.764
<v Speaker 4>Disposable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of brain didn't really have a </v>

3601
02:36:54.001 --> 02:36:54.960
<v Speaker 4>function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

3602
02:36:54.961 --> 02:36:57.630
<v Speaker 4>It was just an optional accessory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the appendix of the brain.</v>

3603
02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:58.913
<v Speaker 4>But then what happens is that they come </v>
<v Speaker 4>to find out that all of a sudden elliot </v>

3604
02:37:01.501 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 4>has all these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though his Iq is unaffected,</v>

3605
02:37:04.651 --> 02:37:08.370
<v Speaker 4>even though his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a verbal intelligence is not affected,</v>

3606
02:37:08.371 --> 02:37:09.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening is,</v>

3607
02:37:09.881 --> 02:37:11.470
<v Speaker 4>is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3608
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:13.890
<v Speaker 4>he's making all these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>

3609
02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>He leaves his wife for a stripper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he snopes.</v>

3610
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:20.503
<v Speaker 4>That's actually who Elliott is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the snopes guy and it's because he </v>

3611
02:37:24.051 --> 02:37:25.350
<v Speaker 4>had cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So don't make fun of him.</v>

3612
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:26.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3613
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:28.010
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3614
02:37:28.010 --> 02:37:28.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3615
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his business,</v>

3616
02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:30.993
<v Speaker 4>he starts speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was business decision making falls </v>

3617
02:37:32.601 --> 02:37:34.550
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He falls for all these conmen,</v>

3618
02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:35.653
<v Speaker 4>he's making all these horrible choices </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he can't decide where to go to </v>

3619
02:37:37.461 --> 02:37:38.294
<v Speaker 4>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what ends up happening is is that an </v>

3620
02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:40.491
<v Speaker 4>11:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>AM,</v>

3621
02:37:40.491 --> 02:37:45.320
<v Speaker 4>he'll try and decide where am I going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to lunch and then by 4:00</v>

3622
02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.153
<v Speaker 4>PM lunches past and that's because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>sat around and tried to calculate </v>

3623
02:37:48.861 --> 02:37:50.390
<v Speaker 4>rationally where should I go to lunch?</v>

3624
02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought about,</v>

3625
02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:52.213
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should I go like based on tables and </v>

3626
02:37:54.891 --> 02:37:58.190
<v Speaker 4>calories and all this sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he couldn't make a decision.</v>

3627
02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.113
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why is because this bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the brain that was removed turns out </v>

3628
02:38:01.611 --> 02:38:02.444
<v Speaker 4>is what links thinking and feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your ventral medial prefrontal </v>

3629
02:38:05.841 --> 02:38:10.841
<v Speaker 4>cortex and deciding where to go to lunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>is influenced constantly by our emotions</v>

3630
02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:12.440
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

3631
02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:13.303
<v Speaker 4>you feel like tie or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like something light or you </v>

3632
02:38:16.581 --> 02:38:18.740
<v Speaker 4>feel like a meatball sub or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 4>may be,</v>

3633
02:38:18.741 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 4>where you feel like if you go to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant,</v>

3634
02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:23.210
<v Speaker 4>you'll run into that really hot waitress</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it may be.</v>

3635
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.943
<v Speaker 4>So that along with the work of Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kahneman and Amos Tversky and the work </v>

3636
02:38:29.631 --> 02:38:30.464
<v Speaker 4>of people like John Height,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's now an immense amount of </v>

3637
02:38:32.781 --> 02:38:33.614
<v Speaker 4>information that basically understands </v>
<v Speaker 4>that descartes who lived 400 years ago </v>

3638
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.210
<v Speaker 4>was making shit up when he came up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>his theory of the brain,</v>

3639
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:42.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3640
02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:44.870
<v Speaker 4>And his theory of the brain of this idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of reason and emotion,</v>

3641
02:38:44.871 --> 02:38:47.870
<v Speaker 4>which has floated around in the West for</v>
<v Speaker 4>ages and ages and ages.</v>

3642
02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:50.660
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't fit the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3643
02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:53.510
<v Speaker 4>that's the basic problem is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I will tell you,</v>

3644
02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:57.770
<v Speaker 4>having worked with students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to improve their lives,</v>

3645
02:38:57.771 --> 02:39:00.290
<v Speaker 4>once you understand that thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling are always linked,</v>

3646
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:03.830
<v Speaker 4>goes massively up because now when a </v>
<v Speaker 4>student starts telling me,</v>

3647
02:39:03.831 --> 02:39:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have the math gene,</v>

3648
02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.280
<v Speaker 4>or I don't have a natural ear for </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages,</v>

3649
02:39:07.570 --> 02:39:10.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't waste my time dealing with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalization.</v>

3650
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Instead I asked the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel about math?</v>

3651
02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about your teacher?</v>

3652
02:39:15.471 --> 02:39:16.304
<v Speaker 4>And we start to deal with the feelings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we start to sort through the </v>

3653
02:39:17.841 --> 02:39:18.674
<v Speaker 4>feelings until we get the feelings lined</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in such a way that you're making the </v>

3654
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:22.190
<v Speaker 4>right choices.</v>

3655
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:24.020
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for me,</v>

3656
02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:25.760
<v Speaker 4>the heart is that there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3657
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:30.180
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem that I first came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this from was education and all this,</v>

3658
02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:31.850
<v Speaker 4>talking about these kids though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>

3659
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:32.684
<v Speaker 4>but it seems almost like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about a user operator </v>

3660
02:39:34.311 --> 02:39:35.144
<v Speaker 4>error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're just programmed </v>

3661
02:39:36.591 --> 02:39:40.040
<v Speaker 4>incorrectly to know how to view the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world by their culture.</v>

3662
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:43.990
<v Speaker 4>Their culture is fucking them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>setting and know.</v>

3663
02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:44.600
<v Speaker 4>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3664
02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:45.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's what you have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3665
02:39:45.731 --> 02:39:46.700
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3666
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:51.410
<v Speaker 4>that's human hardware doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human hardware has not really changed in</v>

3667
02:39:51.411 --> 02:39:54.860
<v Speaker 4>the last hundred thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But human software,</v>

3668
02:39:54.861 --> 02:39:57.800
<v Speaker 4>the culture that we picked up has </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved over time.</v>

3669
02:39:58.190 --> 02:40:00.320
<v Speaker 4>It's constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's constantly changing.</v>

3670
02:40:00.321 --> 02:40:01.154
<v Speaker 4>And now especially because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment is changing so fast because </v>

3671
02:40:03.651 --> 02:40:05.020
<v Speaker 4>of technology and all these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3672
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:06.043
<v Speaker 4>chat filters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to change the culture fast and </v>

3673
02:40:08.241 --> 02:40:11.120
<v Speaker 4>we need to change the culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentionally and so.</v>

3674
02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 4>But who decides how the culture gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed?</v>

3675
02:40:13.561 --> 02:40:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Is it Donald Trump or is it another </v>
<v Speaker 4>month?</v>

3676
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:18.480
<v Speaker 4>And it's not either of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be the group.</v>

3677
02:40:18.690 --> 02:40:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the point is to spark a conversation</v>

3678
02:40:21.121 --> 02:40:24.230
<v Speaker 4>so that we can have this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the point is,</v>

3679
02:40:24.231 --> 02:40:25.064
<v Speaker 4>is there are certain academics who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to try and stand in the way of </v>

3680
02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:28.884
<v Speaker 4>that conversation and will use their </v>
<v Speaker 4>authority to try and shut down that </v>

3681
02:40:31.411 --> 02:40:32.244
<v Speaker 4>conversation because they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend their pet theory in whatever </v>

3682
02:40:35.341 --> 02:40:36.174
<v Speaker 4>discipline it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is where you come back to </v>

3683
02:40:37.081 --> 02:40:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is Dawkins,</v>

3684
02:40:38.431 --> 02:40:40.350
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point is to recognize it's not about</v>

3685
02:40:40.351 --> 02:40:41.184
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to get into the woods </v>

3686
02:40:43.861 --> 02:40:44.694
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3687
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:45.623
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the nuances of all of this sort </v>

3688
02:40:47.071 --> 02:40:47.904
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should get on either David Sloan </v>

3689
02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:50.453
<v Speaker 4>Wilson or John Heider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Henrich and they can like take you </v>

3690
02:40:52.201 --> 02:40:53.100
<v Speaker 4>through the whole thing.</v>

3691
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:56.160
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the basic problem is,</v>

3692
02:40:56.161 --> 02:40:57.960
<v Speaker 4>is that there's a lot of science that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3693
02:40:57.961 --> 02:41:00.030
<v Speaker 4>really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3694
02:41:00.031 --> 02:41:03.660
<v Speaker 4>one man can't figure it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Impossible.</v>

3695
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can't hold onto a theory.</v>

3696
02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to expose it to the marketplace</v>

3697
02:41:09.751 --> 02:41:13.500
<v Speaker 4>of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be tested and what I can do,</v>

3698
02:41:13.530 --> 02:41:14.363
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of this comes down</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what's permissible in the culture of </v>

3699
02:41:16.141 --> 02:41:18.690
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you've got guys like,</v>

3700
02:41:18.691 --> 02:41:19.524
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go if you want to go and like </v>

3701
02:41:20.610 --> 02:41:23.430
<v Speaker 4>read about what David Sloan Wilson is </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying and all of these guys,</v>

3702
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:25.770
<v Speaker 4>you can either go read their books which</v>
<v Speaker 4>are excellent,</v>

3703
02:41:25.970 --> 02:41:26.803
<v Speaker 4>but you can also go to David Sloan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wilson because he has also seen </v>

3704
02:41:29.671 --> 02:41:30.504
<v Speaker 4>practically how much of these ideas can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a difference in people's lives and </v>

3705
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:34.404
<v Speaker 4>actually make people's lives better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also trying to popularize the </v>

3706
02:41:36.681 --> 02:41:36.990
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

3707
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:39.240
<v Speaker 4>So he has a whole website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3708
02:41:39.241 --> 02:41:42.060
<v Speaker 4>this view of life and economics and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of stuff.</v>

3709
02:41:42.350 --> 02:41:45.240
<v Speaker 4>And if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a great article by Peter Turchin</v>

3710
02:41:45.241 --> 02:41:49.230
<v Speaker 4>who's another guy and he'll take you </v>
<v Speaker 4>through some of the stuff around Dawkins</v>

3711
02:41:49.231 --> 02:41:51.900
<v Speaker 4>and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what my,</v>

3712
02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:52.763
<v Speaker 4>my goal with all of this stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Soul's work with David Sloan </v>

3713
02:41:56.850 --> 02:41:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Height,</v>

3714
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:58.503
<v Speaker 4>you know Carol dwecks work was just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of this education stuff is that I </v>

3715
02:42:01.351 --> 02:42:04.320
<v Speaker 4>know that it's not realistic to expect </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to.</v>

3716
02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:06.240
<v Speaker 4>That I can't just like put a list on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

3717
02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:09.060
<v Speaker 4>have 50 books and be like everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to read these 50 bucks.</v>

3718
02:42:09.061 --> 02:42:10.560
<v Speaker 4>Like people have other shit to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3719
02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3720
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't concern yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3721
02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.970
<v Speaker 4>I've just suggested enough people will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ideas will start to permeate.</v>

3722
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:20.580
<v Speaker 4>But you also what your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you run into.</v>

3723
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:23.370
<v Speaker 4>And this is part of what I've run into </v>
<v Speaker 4>with education right,</v>

3724
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:24.660
<v Speaker 4>is so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3725
02:42:24.661 --> 02:42:26.880
<v Speaker 4>along with Katie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my Bostonian friend,</v>

3726
02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:28.013
<v Speaker 4>we took seven different fields of </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroscience and psychology and we </v>

3727
02:42:30.691 --> 02:42:31.524
<v Speaker 4>condensed them all into one book that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote to the teenager because we wanted </v>

3728
02:42:34.561 --> 02:42:35.394
<v Speaker 4>to have a message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Problem is most of these books are </v>

3729
02:42:36.631 --> 02:42:39.060
<v Speaker 4>written to adults and you write the book</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the adult,</v>

3730
02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:41.190
<v Speaker 4>the adult reads it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the parent reads that and they're like,</v>

3731
02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so great.</v>

3732
02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.540
<v Speaker 4>And then now they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable position of having to have</v>

3733
02:42:45.541 --> 02:42:48.540
<v Speaker 4>a conversation about school with kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the ideas die.</v>

3734
02:42:48.541 --> 02:42:50.730
<v Speaker 4>The idea is don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were like,</v>

3735
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:54.030
<v Speaker 4>let's skip the middle man and let or </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle woman and let's write straight to</v>

3736
02:42:54.031 --> 02:42:55.830
<v Speaker 4>the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the book is called the straight a</v>

3737
02:42:55.831 --> 02:42:56.664
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why we called it the </v>

3738
02:42:58.351 --> 02:42:59.184
<v Speaker 4>straight a conspiracy is because we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time we're working with the son </v>

3739
02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:06.420
<v Speaker 4>of a guy named Stan Rogo who was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>executive producer on Lizzie Mcguire.</v>

3740
02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:07.890
<v Speaker 4>And we'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3741
02:43:07.891 --> 02:43:09.780
<v Speaker 4>this is the power of emotions by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

3742
02:43:09.810 --> 02:43:11.070
<v Speaker 4>like super predators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lizzie,</v>

3743
02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Lizzie mcguire was like that hate hilary</v>
<v Speaker 4>duff,</v>

3744
02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:15.850
<v Speaker 4>a kids' TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3745
02:43:15.851 --> 02:43:17.800
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the nineties it was like super big.</v>

3746
02:43:17.801 --> 02:43:20.830
<v Speaker 4>It was the miley cyrus of like or early </v>
<v Speaker 4>two thousands I think.</v>

3747
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:23.110
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we,</v>

3748
02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:23.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were struggling with how do you have </v>

3749
02:43:25.811 --> 02:43:26.644
<v Speaker 4>a conversation about education in school</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your potential and all these sorts </v>

3750
02:43:29.561 --> 02:43:31.510
<v Speaker 4>of things with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3751
02:43:31.511 --> 02:43:32.344
<v Speaker 4>our intuitions are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sort of the classic teacher </v>

3752
02:43:33.791 --> 02:43:35.020
<v Speaker 4>intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

3753
02:43:35.021 --> 02:43:37.030
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're amazing,</v>

3754
02:43:37.031 --> 02:43:37.864
<v Speaker 4>like you have so much potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we had sat down with Stan and Stan </v>

3755
02:43:41.801 --> 02:43:42.401
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

3756
02:43:42.401 --> 02:43:46.810
<v Speaker 4>I've been making kids' tv for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and if I've learned one thing about</v>

3757
02:43:46.811 --> 02:43:48.070
<v Speaker 4>teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

3758
02:43:48.250 --> 02:43:49.083
<v Speaker 4>their lives suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They may not suck at any sort of </v>

3759
02:43:51.011 --> 02:43:51.844
<v Speaker 4>objective sense or any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>geographical sense or anything like </v>

3760
02:43:54.731 --> 02:43:57.010
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on an emotional subjective level,</v>

3761
02:43:57.220 --> 02:43:58.053
<v Speaker 4>they suck.</v>

3762
02:43:58.150 --> 02:44:01.750
<v Speaker 4>And so the only thing you could ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell them that they will believe is that</v>

3763
02:44:01.751 --> 02:44:05.710
<v Speaker 4>they've been lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what we did.</v>

3764
02:44:05.770 --> 02:44:06.760
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3765
02:44:06.761 --> 02:44:09.250
<v Speaker 4>the title of your book is the something </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy.</v>

3766
02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:10.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3767
02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:13.810
<v Speaker 4>And so we went away and we did the </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight a conspiracy.</v>

3768
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:16.330
<v Speaker 4>And rather than getting kids to believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3769
02:44:16.450 --> 02:44:18.970
<v Speaker 4>believe in themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got them to doubt their doubts.</v>

3770
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:20.463
<v Speaker 4>And once you got them doubting their </v>
<v Speaker 4>doubts and you know all the things that </v>

3771
02:44:23.561 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 4>they believed about math genes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that really true?</v>

3772
02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:28.720
<v Speaker 4>How do we know that brow like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that really,</v>

3773
02:44:28.721 --> 02:44:29.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff.</v>

3774
02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:31.113
<v Speaker 4>And then you get that process where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are now starting to question things and </v>

3775
02:44:34.061 --> 02:44:34.894
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did the first chapter is all about </v>

3776
02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:37.500
<v Speaker 4>genius myths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3777
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:38.680
<v Speaker 4>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3778
02:44:39.430 --> 02:44:41.560
<v Speaker 4>essentially very clever marketing </v>
<v Speaker 4>schemes that again,</v>

3779
02:44:41.561 --> 02:44:43.000
<v Speaker 4>rely on that thing of all.</v>

3780
02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:46.050
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at someone like Steve </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jobs,</v>

3781
02:44:46.051 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Jobs was very smart marketer,</v>

3782
02:44:49.061 --> 02:44:50.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He created this image,</v>

3783
02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:53.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This cult of personality around himself,</v>

3784
02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:55.030
<v Speaker 4>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3785
02:44:55.031 --> 02:44:59.200
<v Speaker 4>he made himself seem like this genius </v>
<v Speaker 4>who out of nowhere came out of all these</v>

3786
02:44:59.201 --> 02:45:00.034
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people call them the I got and the cult </v>

3787
02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:05.140
<v Speaker 4>of Mac and what is the effect of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect of all his blind copying.</v>

3788
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:06.003
<v Speaker 4>We just had to have that Mac product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that he was copying the playbook </v>

3789
02:45:09.851 --> 02:45:11.320
<v Speaker 4>of another guy much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much earlier,</v>

3790
02:45:11.470 --> 02:45:12.303
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Edison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who in his own time created this own </v>

3791
02:45:14.321 --> 02:45:15.154
<v Speaker 4>cult of personality around himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the time he was known as the </v>

3792
02:45:16.961 --> 02:45:19.450
<v Speaker 4>wizard of Menlo Park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in reality,</v>

3793
02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:21.130
<v Speaker 4>did Edison invented the light bulb?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3794
02:45:21.131 --> 02:45:21.964
<v Speaker 4>he did not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The light bulb was around 45 years </v>

3795
02:45:23.411 --> 02:45:25.860
<v Speaker 4>before he was even born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ripped off Tesla.</v>

3796
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:28.343
<v Speaker 4>You watch drunk history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I received Duncan trussell's version of </v>

3797
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:32.023
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all on Nikola Tesla and Thomas </v>

3798
02:45:34.210 --> 02:45:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Edison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Edison,</v>

3799
02:45:35.441 --> 02:45:36.390
<v Speaker 4>and being a con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3800
02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:38.680
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3801
02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:40.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the point is that,</v>

3802
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:41.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3803
02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.150
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people were people and you know,</v>

3804
02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:47.620
<v Speaker 4>the myths that you have about geniuses </v>
<v Speaker 4>are actually clever advertising schemes.</v>

3805
02:45:47.890 --> 02:45:50.200
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it's an ad jingle that,</v>

3806
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:54.490
<v Speaker 4>that is so good that we've essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>had that jingle trapped in our heads for</v>

3807
02:45:54.491 --> 02:45:58.120
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are ideas that are passed on,</v>

3808
02:45:58.121 --> 02:46:00.850
<v Speaker 4>like Edison had a thousand patents to </v>
<v Speaker 4>his name before he,</v>

3809
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 4>by the time he died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>

3810
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:05.560
<v Speaker 4>That's because when you set up an </v>
<v Speaker 4>industrial research lab,</v>

3811
02:46:05.561 --> 02:46:06.394
<v Speaker 4>you make sure that your name is on all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the patents because that's the whole </v>

3812
02:46:08.651 --> 02:46:10.640
<v Speaker 4>point of employing a bunch of people is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3813
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:12.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to own the Ip.</v>

3814
02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:13.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's true for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3815
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Mozart was the Michael Jackson of the 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>

3816
02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Isaac Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3817
02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:21.710
<v Speaker 4>they basically knew that they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>sell the ideas of gravity,</v>

3818
02:46:21.711 --> 02:46:22.544
<v Speaker 4>so they sold Newton is the man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy who had this great vision and </v>

3819
02:46:25.430 --> 02:46:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3820
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:28.430
<v Speaker 4>and the story of the apple and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>

3821
02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.020
<v Speaker 4>and then Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3822
02:46:30.021 --> 02:46:30.854
<v Speaker 4>they needed to package the new physics </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was being done by lots and lots of </v>

3823
02:46:33.381 --> 02:46:36.230
<v Speaker 4>physicist Heisenberg and planck and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of stuff.</v>

3824
02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:38.090
<v Speaker 4>But there was this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arthur Eddington,</v>

3825
02:46:38.091 --> 02:46:42.470
<v Speaker 4>who knew he couldn't sell that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he sold the idea of a boy wonder with</v>

3826
02:46:42.471 --> 02:46:46.640
<v Speaker 4>crazy hair who had beaten Newton and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>displacing Newton.</v>

3827
02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Now the point is you go and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>physicists and they'll tell you,</v>

3828
02:46:49.371 --> 02:46:50.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not really true.</v>

3829
02:46:50.781 --> 02:46:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Like Einstein didn't really displace </v>
<v Speaker 4>Newton,</v>

3830
02:46:52.761 --> 02:46:54.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still use newtonian mechanics.</v>

3831
02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:58.130
<v Speaker 4>We only use Einsteinian mechanics when </v>
<v Speaker 4>we start to get near the speed of light,</v>

3832
02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:00.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are all these marketing,</v>

3833
02:47:00.260 --> 02:47:01.880
<v Speaker 4>the marketing schemes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3834
02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:06.510
<v Speaker 4>But in the marketplace of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of what happens is,</v>

3835
02:47:06.511 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 4>is that there are these big public </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals like Richard Dawkins,</v>

3836
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:11.563
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have a lot of power and it </v>

3837
02:47:13.701 --> 02:47:15.400
<v Speaker 4>becomes very difficult to challenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3838
02:47:15.401 --> 02:47:16.234
<v Speaker 4>And in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that anybody particularly </v>

3839
02:47:18.381 --> 02:47:20.780
<v Speaker 4>wants to go up against Richard Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3840
02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:23.330
<v Speaker 4>He's a sacred cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a sacred cow.</v>

3841
02:47:23.331 --> 02:47:26.420
<v Speaker 4>And if you go up against the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>atheists or you challenge anything about</v>

3842
02:47:26.421 --> 02:47:27.950
<v Speaker 4>the new atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have,</v>

3843
02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:28.761
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3844
02:47:28.761 --> 02:47:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole rationalist intuitionist thing</v>

3845
02:47:32.090 --> 02:47:35.420
<v Speaker 4>because I've been trying to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions on our podcast.</v>

3846
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:36.840
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3847
02:47:36.890 --> 02:47:37.521
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3848
02:47:37.521 --> 02:47:40.340
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this Guy John Height,</v>

3849
02:47:40.341 --> 02:47:42.800
<v Speaker 4>who's a big famous scientists and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff.</v>

3850
02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.633
<v Speaker 4>And then there's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris who has a phd in </v>

3851
02:47:45.111 --> 02:47:45.944
<v Speaker 4>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but John Height is saying rationalist </v>

3852
02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:49.700
<v Speaker 4>versus intuitionist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference.</v>

3853
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:50.563
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I want to talk about that and I'm </v>

3854
02:47:51.771 --> 02:47:53.930
<v Speaker 4>going to tell you that I think that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>light of the evidence,</v>

3855
02:47:53.931 --> 02:47:54.764
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris was wrong and I got a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of angry tweets from a guy named </v>

3856
02:47:58.190 --> 02:48:03.050
<v Speaker 4>at Atheist Sensei proceeded to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was a fucking idiot,</v>

3857
02:48:03.051 --> 02:48:03.441
<v Speaker 4>and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3858
02:48:03.441 --> 02:48:04.274
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what did I know and how arrogant I </v>

3859
02:48:05.211 --> 02:48:07.580
<v Speaker 4>was and how dare you and all this sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

3860
02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.910
<v Speaker 4>But once you understand your argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't really.</v>

3861
02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:11.773
<v Speaker 4>So what did he just jump at you because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fact that you're questioning his </v>

3862
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:18.170
<v Speaker 4>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He basically and then what?</v>

3863
02:48:18.171 --> 02:48:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I man his man and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>

3864
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:21.020
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3865
02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:25.370
<v Speaker 4>it was productive because what he said </v>
<v Speaker 4>is he said,</v>

3866
02:48:25.371 --> 02:48:27.020
<v Speaker 4>what are you even talking about?</v>

3867
02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris knows that most people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being emotional most of the time,</v>

3868
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:37.580
<v Speaker 4>but the issue isn't what Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows about other people.</v>

3869
02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:40.550
<v Speaker 4>It's what a Sam Harris believe about his</v>
<v Speaker 4>own brain.</v>

3870
02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Sam Harris,</v>

3871
02:48:43.090 --> 02:48:43.923
<v Speaker 4>he's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is not sam's fault as an </v>

3872
02:48:45.681 --> 02:48:46.514
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as none of the cultural stuff that </v>

3873
02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:50.030
<v Speaker 4>we've been talking about is his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3874
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:50.923
<v Speaker 4>when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also believed in this whole idea of </v>

3875
02:48:54.681 --> 02:48:56.720
<v Speaker 4>descartes' error,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that reason and emotion are separate.</v>

3876
02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:57.853
<v Speaker 4>And then I moved out to la and I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an acting class and I moved from an </v>

3877
02:49:01.611 --> 02:49:05.690
<v Speaker 4>environment that worshiped reason to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment that worshiped emotion,</v>

3878
02:49:05.810 --> 02:49:07.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what actors do all day.</v>

3879
02:49:07.501 --> 02:49:08.334
<v Speaker 4>They fucking talk about their feelings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so for somebody who had come from </v>

3880
02:49:11.671 --> 02:49:14.670
<v Speaker 4>that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was super fucking annoying.</v>

3881
02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:15.563
<v Speaker 4>I found actors really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really annoying because they would not </v>

3882
02:49:17.251 --> 02:49:19.080
<v Speaker 4>stop talking about their feelings and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>pissed me off.</v>

3883
02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.160
<v Speaker 4>It pissed me off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It pissed me off.</v>

3884
02:49:20.490 --> 02:49:23.070
<v Speaker 4>And the certain point I got so annoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3885
02:49:23.071 --> 02:49:26.400
<v Speaker 4>you fuckers don't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about.</v>

3886
02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:29.280
<v Speaker 4>The only real authorities are </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists.</v>

3887
02:49:29.610 --> 02:49:32.220
<v Speaker 4>So what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went off and I read the scientists and</v>

3888
02:49:32.221 --> 02:49:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I found out that the actors were right </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was fucking humiliating.</v>

3889
02:49:35.761 --> 02:49:37.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3890
02:49:37.381 --> 02:49:39.720
<v Speaker 4>How they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right about the importance of emotions.</v>

3891
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Emotions are hugely important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They drive thinking,</v>

3892
02:49:42.390 --> 02:49:43.223
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what these actors are </v>

3893
02:49:44.221 --> 02:49:45.450
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that,</v>

3894
02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:46.493
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just being emotional because </v>

3895
02:49:48.211 --> 02:49:49.044
<v Speaker 4>it's indulgent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're being indulgent and they're not </v>

3896
02:49:50.971 --> 02:49:53.790
<v Speaker 4>managing their emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what you're supposed to do,</v>

3897
02:49:54.270 --> 02:49:56.100
<v Speaker 4>but what you find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

3898
02:49:56.101 --> 02:49:58.050
<v Speaker 4>So here's a simple thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3899
02:49:58.400 --> 02:49:59.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why we say that and </v>

3900
02:50:01.410 --> 02:50:02.243
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that intersected with working with </v>

3901
02:50:03.181 --> 02:50:03.930
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3902
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:06.000
<v Speaker 4>So if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3903
02:50:06.001 --> 02:50:07.830
<v Speaker 4>students say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel stupid,</v>

3904
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:10.770
<v Speaker 4>turns out that stupid is a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically,</v>

3905
02:50:10.771 --> 02:50:12.780
<v Speaker 4>it's the feeling of shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3906
02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:13.973
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also being ineffective in your </v>

3907
02:50:15.481 --> 02:50:18.720
<v Speaker 4>intellectual pursuits and a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>helplessness and all that sort of stuff,</v>

3908
02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:20.310
<v Speaker 4>but feel inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3909
02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:21.233
<v Speaker 4>And it's specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a feeling called learned </v>

3910
02:50:22.501 --> 02:50:23.550
<v Speaker 4>helplessness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3911
02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:24.713
<v Speaker 4>In,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in academic circles where there are </v>

3912
02:50:25.951 --> 02:50:27.630
<v Speaker 4>terrible names for everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3913
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:28.950
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3914
02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:29.813
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeling of shame motivates a very </v>

3915
02:50:31.291 --> 02:50:34.110
<v Speaker 4>specific behavior which is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid the source of their shame,</v>

3916
02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:37.470
<v Speaker 4>your shame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when students get back a bad test,</v>

3917
02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:41.180
<v Speaker 4>what they do is they want it up and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw it away and they avoid math.</v>

3918
02:50:41.250 --> 02:50:42.720
<v Speaker 4>They avoid math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3919
02:50:43.050 --> 02:50:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point is,</v>

3920
02:50:44.171 --> 02:50:45.004
<v Speaker 4>is that that is that behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally the worst response you can </v>

3921
02:50:48.901 --> 02:50:51.180
<v Speaker 4>have to failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3922
02:50:51.570 --> 02:50:53.910
<v Speaker 4>If you're screwing up in math or any </v>
<v Speaker 4>other subject,</v>

3923
02:50:53.911 --> 02:50:55.920
<v Speaker 4>what you should be doing is getting out </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mistakes,</v>

3924
02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:59.070
<v Speaker 4>analyzing your mistakes and using them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get better,</v>

3925
02:50:59.430 --> 02:51:03.330
<v Speaker 4>and so that very simple thing is what we</v>
<v Speaker 4>did with all of our students.</v>

3926
02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:05.970
<v Speaker 4>We sat them down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we made them confront their mistakes.</v>

3927
02:51:05.971 --> 02:51:06.930
<v Speaker 4>We made them say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3928
02:51:06.931 --> 02:51:09.000
<v Speaker 4>number three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did you get number three wrong?</v>

3929
02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And then you figure out why number three</v>
<v Speaker 4>is wrong,</v>

3930
02:51:11.370 --> 02:51:12.510
<v Speaker 4>and then you fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3931
02:51:12.511 --> 02:51:14.430
<v Speaker 4>how does this oppose what Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 4>believes?</v>

3932
02:51:14.780 --> 02:51:17.310
<v Speaker 4>The point is is that does Sam does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

3933
02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:20.820
<v Speaker 4>if an atheist Sensei,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I will tell you that I think that an</v>

3934
02:51:20.821 --> 02:51:25.680
<v Speaker 4>atheist Sensei is pretty right in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a sense in his assessment of what Sam</v>

3935
02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:26.513
<v Speaker 4>Harris believes about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like most people are emotional most of </v>

3936
02:51:28.921 --> 02:51:29.754
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that Sam Harris </v>

3937
02:51:31.021 --> 02:51:31.854
<v Speaker 4>believes that thinking and feeling are </v>
<v Speaker 4>always linked so that his brain is all </v>

3938
02:51:35.521 --> 02:51:37.380
<v Speaker 4>know this for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you discussed this with him?</v>

3939
02:51:37.381 --> 02:51:40.080
<v Speaker 4>Because I know I'm getting a text from </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and about fucking five minutes.</v>

3940
02:51:40.081 --> 02:51:41.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you for example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3941
02:51:41.701 --> 02:51:46.701
<v Speaker 4>so how does Sam Harris feel about God or</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does Sam Harris feel about religion?</v>

3942
02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:51.473
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty open ended question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe in religion and I </v>

3943
02:51:54.661 --> 02:51:57.660
<v Speaker 4>don't think he necessarily believes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>any form of a deity.</v>

3944
02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk.</v>

3945
02:51:58.490 --> 02:52:00.780
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about it.</v>

3946
02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:02.700
<v Speaker 4>I know that you have a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>

3947
02:52:02.730 --> 02:52:04.470
<v Speaker 4>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But forget about that.</v>

3948
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Why those questions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you look at,</v>

3949
02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 4>let's look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3950
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:10.210
<v Speaker 4>you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your friends,</v>

3951
02:52:10.211 --> 02:52:11.740
<v Speaker 4>the narco capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3952
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:13.300
<v Speaker 4>And Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3953
02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Who just want to get rid of government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3954
02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:17.770
<v Speaker 4>And they're just trying to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all government,</v>

3955
02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:19.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is that?</v>

3956
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:21.160
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about?</v>

3957
02:52:21.161 --> 02:52:25.240
<v Speaker 4>What does that psychology about or any </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a or Muslim fundamentalists,</v>

3958
02:52:25.241 --> 02:52:27.220
<v Speaker 4>they just want to get rid of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>western influences.</v>

3959
02:52:27.430 --> 02:52:28.263
<v Speaker 4>They basically think that a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is bad and they're constantly </v>

3960
02:52:30.101 --> 02:52:31.420
<v Speaker 4>trying to strip it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strip it out,</v>

3961
02:52:31.421 --> 02:52:32.260
<v Speaker 4>strip it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strip it out.</v>

3962
02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:33.573
<v Speaker 4>That's the nature of fundamentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris are </v>

3963
02:52:37.571 --> 02:52:38.404
<v Speaker 4>atheist fundamentalists and specifically</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Dawkins has talked about </v>

3964
02:52:41.291 --> 02:52:42.124
<v Speaker 4>militant atheism that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Richard Dawkins has said that </v>

3965
02:52:44.201 --> 02:52:48.370
<v Speaker 4>religion is the scourge of humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we need to get rid of religion.</v>

3966
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in reality,</v>

3967
02:52:49.931 --> 02:52:50.764
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the scientific evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're going to find out is that </v>

3968
02:52:53.831 --> 02:52:56.620
<v Speaker 4>religion has a very checkered past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3969
02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:57.880
<v Speaker 4>And that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3970
02:52:57.881 --> 02:53:00.220
<v Speaker 4>that religion has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3971
02:53:00.310 --> 02:53:02.680
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the history of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3972
02:53:02.681 --> 02:53:03.514
<v Speaker 4>Steven pinker has this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better angels of our nature and he </v>

3973
02:53:05.861 --> 02:53:07.360
<v Speaker 4>talks about the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3974
02:53:07.361 --> 02:53:08.194
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the new atheists are saying about </v>

3975
02:53:09.131 --> 02:53:11.140
<v Speaker 4>religion is not supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence,</v>

3976
02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:13.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That in history,</v>

3977
02:53:13.031 --> 02:53:15.760
<v Speaker 4>religion has not been any one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3978
02:53:15.761 --> 02:53:17.080
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's had some good things,</v>

3979
02:53:17.081 --> 02:53:17.914
<v Speaker 4>it's had some bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's not a scientifically </v>

3980
02:53:19.901 --> 02:53:20.734
<v Speaker 4>appropriate belief to go around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that religion is the scourge of </v>

3981
02:53:23.111 --> 02:53:26.530
<v Speaker 4>all humanity or to be waging war about </v>
<v Speaker 4>over religion.</v>

3982
02:53:26.700 --> 02:53:30.880
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about Dawkins and Sam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harris and all that sort of stuff.</v>

3983
02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:33.870
<v Speaker 4>And particularly Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's the most militant them.</v>

3984
02:53:33.950 --> 02:53:34.783
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3985
02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Separately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3986
02:53:36.431 --> 02:53:39.850
<v Speaker 4>why do people believe in religion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is religion really about?</v>

3987
02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because people don't understand how</v>

3988
02:53:43.121 --> 02:53:43.954
<v Speaker 4>to control their environment and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>their minds fill in and they're trying </v>

3989
02:53:46.421 --> 02:53:50.320
<v Speaker 4>to make sense of how do we get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that we also like all the rest of</v>

3990
02:53:50.321 --> 02:53:51.640
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's passed down.</v>

3991
02:53:51.641 --> 02:53:52.474
<v Speaker 4>That's learned behavior and imitating </v>
<v Speaker 4>atmospheres and adopting predetermined </v>

3992
02:53:55.991 --> 02:53:57.050
<v Speaker 4>patterns of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3993
02:53:57.250 --> 02:53:58.570
<v Speaker 4>And thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3994
02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:01.690
<v Speaker 4>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know Dawkins and Sam Harris,</v>

3995
02:54:01.691 --> 02:54:03.070
<v Speaker 4>their stated objective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3996
02:54:03.071 --> 02:54:07.780
<v Speaker 4>As they want to promote evolution right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now I taught,</v>

3997
02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:08.673
<v Speaker 4>I had to tutor some students who were at</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Christian school that taught </v>

3998
02:54:11.831 --> 02:54:16.330
<v Speaker 4>creationism and it's oaks Christian in </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand oaks.</v>

3999
02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had never like honestly,</v>

4000
02:54:19.930 --> 02:54:20.763
<v Speaker 4>like pre doing that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never thought much about the new </v>

4001
02:54:23.621 --> 02:54:25.540
<v Speaker 4>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they just weren't a big deal.</v>

4002
02:54:25.540 --> 02:54:26.291
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4003
02:54:26.291 --> 02:54:28.540
<v Speaker 4>those guys are out doing whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing.</v>

4004
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:29.463
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I went into this Christian </v>

4005
02:54:31.031 --> 02:54:31.864
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist school or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or school that teaches creationism and </v>

4006
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:37.630
<v Speaker 4>all they could talk about was Richard </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins and Sam Harris.</v>

4007
02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:39.033
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about them constantly </v>

4008
02:54:40.270 --> 02:54:44.170
<v Speaker 4>and in their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris represent</v>

4009
02:54:44.171 --> 02:54:47.230
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are the face of science in the same</v>

4010
02:54:47.231 --> 02:54:48.070
<v Speaker 4>way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4011
02:54:48.071 --> 02:54:53.071
<v Speaker 4>some guy in the midwest when he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about when he thinks about Islam,</v>

4012
02:54:53.231 --> 02:54:55.990
<v Speaker 4>he's thinking about isis or al Qaeda or </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff.</v>

4013
02:54:56.230 --> 02:55:00.490
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't understand that those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't represent the majority of Muslims.</v>

4014
02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:03.890
<v Speaker 4>And in the same way in this right.</v>

4015
02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:05.113
<v Speaker 1>Dorkins and Harris were being used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent science in general and to </v>

4016
02:55:08.961 --> 02:55:11.630
<v Speaker 1>represent evolution in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4017
02:55:11.631 --> 02:55:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So they are essentially for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people forming the stereotype of science</v>

4018
02:55:15.490 --> 02:55:17.840
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in opposition to them.</v>

4019
02:55:17.841 --> 02:55:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean with an opposition to Dawkins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris.</v>

4020
02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And there were certain things they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their teaching like they would do,</v>

4021
02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:26.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4022
02:55:26.291 --> 02:55:26.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4023
02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:27.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school,</v>

4024
02:55:27.591 --> 02:55:28.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird experience because one </v>

4025
02:55:29.570 --> 02:55:30.403
<v Speaker 1>school had the very best rhetoric </v>
<v Speaker 1>department that I've ever seen of any </v>

4026
02:55:33.561 --> 02:55:34.394
<v Speaker 1>school because they knew that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have people attacking their </v>

4027
02:55:36.531 --> 02:55:37.364
<v Speaker 1>beliefs for their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you had to know all the logical </v>

4028
02:55:39.201 --> 02:55:41.110
<v Speaker 1>fallacies Straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4029
02:55:41.270 --> 02:55:43.820
<v Speaker 1>to quote quail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where stuff and the worst science</v>

4030
02:55:43.821 --> 02:55:46.720
<v Speaker 1>department for fuck you seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4031
02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Wonder why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well exactly.</v>

4032
02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4033
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:50.990
<v Speaker 1>they did all sorts of things.</v>

4034
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a whole unit on Isms,</v>

4035
02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:56.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like Nazis and fascism,</v>

4036
02:55:56.391 --> 02:55:57.224
<v Speaker 1>communism and how bad isms were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then right after that they taught </v>

4037
02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the controversy around evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>

4038
02:56:03.951 --> 02:56:06.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are four different theories of the</v>

4039
02:56:06.081 --> 02:56:07.640
<v Speaker 1>origins of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4040
02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:10.880
<v Speaker 1>One is young Earth creationism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is intelligent design,</v>

4041
02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:11.923
<v Speaker 1>one is earth is metaphorical day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth one is a evolution </v>

4042
02:56:16.581 --> 02:56:20.240
<v Speaker 1>isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just so evolutionism,</v>

4043
02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:23.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after telling you the evils of Isms,</v>

4044
02:56:23.210 --> 02:56:24.210
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4045
02:56:24.211 --> 02:56:26.360
<v Speaker 1>so you're going on a long circuitous </v>
<v Speaker 1>route here.</v>

4046
02:56:26.361 --> 02:56:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So because causation is about Harris so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4047
02:56:29.061 --> 02:56:29.894
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is wrong with his views </v>
<v Speaker 1>on God and what's wrong with his views </v>

4048
02:56:32.541 --> 02:56:33.560
<v Speaker 1>on religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4049
02:56:33.561 --> 02:56:36.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that religion is a set of beliefs.</v>

4050
02:56:36.621 --> 02:56:39.680
<v Speaker 1>And actually many of these beliefs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted to their environment even though</v>

4051
02:56:39.681 --> 02:56:40.514
<v Speaker 1>they seem cookie and they're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies that are strictly enforced </v>

4052
02:56:43.041 --> 02:56:45.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big issue with.</v>

4053
02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:48.200
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that is the issue if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to.</v>

4054
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So this comes down to how do you change </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds and what does the science</v>

4055
02:56:51.861 --> 02:56:54.950
<v Speaker 1>say about how you change people's minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how do you move ideas?</v>

4056
02:56:55.010 --> 02:56:55.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that his mocking of </v>

4057
02:56:57.921 --> 02:57:01.190
<v Speaker 1>these ideas is contrary to the expanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge.</v>

4058
02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a people are going to resist it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4059
02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:04.503
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote a productive exchange of ideas </v>

4060
02:57:06.471 --> 02:57:08.420
<v Speaker 1>between tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's isn't that debate about.</v>

4061
02:57:08.421 --> 02:57:09.254
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of people in listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really excellent constructed arguments </v>

4062
02:57:12.801 --> 02:57:16.280
<v Speaker 1>against religion will change their mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>well like everything,</v>

4063
02:57:16.310 --> 02:57:17.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

4064
02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:18.800
<v Speaker 1>rule 34,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4065
02:57:18.850 --> 02:57:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rule 34,</v>

4066
02:57:20.631 --> 02:57:22.640
<v Speaker 1>if you can imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is porn of it,</v>

4067
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:24.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the same way,</v>

4068
02:57:24.921 --> 02:57:26.810
<v Speaker 1>if you can imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is science of it,</v>

4069
02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:28.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4070
02:57:28.190 --> 02:57:31.730
<v Speaker 1>But hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually science on how ideas</v>

4071
02:57:31.731 --> 02:57:32.564
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

4072
02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:33.553
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole field of it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this book called the diffusion of </v>

4073
02:57:36.651 --> 02:57:37.760
<v Speaker 1>innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4074
02:57:37.761 --> 02:57:38.594
<v Speaker 1>And I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was working with these </v>

4075
02:57:39.531 --> 02:57:40.390
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4076
02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out how do we get</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas to move and so I was like,</v>

4077
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:48.050
<v Speaker 1>oh thank God there's a book all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how ideas move.</v>

4078
02:57:48.170 --> 02:57:49.003
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you come to find out is that </v>

4079
02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:52.033
<v Speaker 1>all of the research shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of things that </v>

4080
02:57:54.261 --> 02:57:55.094
<v Speaker 1>make ideas move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing is they have to be compatible </v>

4081
02:57:57.621 --> 02:58:02.130
<v Speaker 1>with people's existing beliefs and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>also they have to be practical</v>

4082
02:58:02.430 --> 02:58:05.220
<v Speaker 4>so they have to confer some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical benefit.</v>

4083
02:58:05.610 --> 02:58:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if in terms of moving evolution,</v>

4084
02:58:10.170 --> 02:58:12.600
<v Speaker 4>the first thing is to recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4085
02:58:12.601 --> 02:58:15.750
<v Speaker 4>if we really want to like not just spend</v>
<v Speaker 4>another hundred and 50 years,</v>

4086
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.823
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a fight between science and </v>

4087
02:58:17.941 --> 02:58:18.774
<v Speaker 4>religion and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing to realize is that what </v>

4088
02:58:21.031 --> 02:58:21.864
<v Speaker 4>people like David Sloan Wilson are </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying is fundamentally compatible with </v>

4089
02:58:24.721 --> 02:58:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4090
02:58:26.221 --> 02:58:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Because they understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4091
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:30.570
<v Speaker 4>that altruism matters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4092
02:58:30.571 --> 02:58:31.860
<v Speaker 4>All this sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4093
02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:37.230
<v Speaker 4>The sort of doc doc type notion of it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>all about selfishness and everybody just</v>

4094
02:58:37.231 --> 02:58:39.120
<v Speaker 4>trying to fuck everybody and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>

4095
02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Part of it is that doesn't fit well with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

4096
02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:43.253
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't fit well with religious </v>

4097
02:58:44.191 --> 02:58:45.180
<v Speaker 4>notions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4098
02:58:45.570 --> 02:58:48.210
<v Speaker 4>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of this stuff that I'm talking about</v>

4099
02:58:48.211 --> 02:58:51.120
<v Speaker 4>with cultural evolution is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical,</v>

4100
02:58:51.390 --> 02:58:51.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4101
02:58:51.690 --> 02:58:52.523
<v Speaker 4>You can see that if we have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation as humanity about culture </v>

4102
02:58:56.431 --> 02:58:57.264
<v Speaker 4>and how my choices are being driven and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff so that I can </v>

4103
02:59:00.031 --> 02:59:01.740
<v Speaker 4>change my culture and all that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

4104
02:59:01.741 --> 02:59:02.574
<v Speaker 4>that we can fix a whole lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That notion of culture relies on group </v>

4105
02:59:06.511 --> 02:59:07.890
<v Speaker 4>selection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4106
02:59:07.891 --> 02:59:08.724
<v Speaker 4>It relies on this multilevel selection </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that Dawkins is not on board with </v>

4107
02:59:12.301 --> 02:59:15.060
<v Speaker 4>and all that sort of stuff and that Sam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harris is not on board with.</v>

4108
02:59:16.050 --> 02:59:20.580
<v Speaker 4>So ultimately what I want to do is I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to move these ideas,</v>

4109
02:59:20.850 --> 02:59:22.260
<v Speaker 4>but the whole point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

4110
02:59:22.350 --> 02:59:23.183
<v Speaker 4>is that part of the reason why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought me on this podcast today is </v>

4111
02:59:25.981 --> 02:59:28.050
<v Speaker 4>specifically because I called out </v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard.</v>

4112
02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:29.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4113
02:59:29.010 --> 02:59:29.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4114
02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:30.353
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought you on because Brian Cowen </v>

4115
02:59:31.391 --> 02:59:33.360
<v Speaker 3>recommends you and I listen to you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his podcast.</v>

4116
02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:34.413
<v Speaker 3>He had nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that'd be an interesting </v>

4117
02:59:35.461 --> 02:59:36.480
<v Speaker 3>topic of discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4118
02:59:36.930 --> 02:59:37.763
<v Speaker 3>But I still don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that essentially Sam </v>

4119
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:43.253
<v Speaker 3>Harris's refused one or refuting rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>of religion and his ideas about </v>

4120
02:59:49.411 --> 02:59:50.244
<v Speaker 3>spreading what he believes are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>empirical truths about science are in </v>

4121
02:59:55.411 --> 02:59:56.244
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another causing a resistance </v>
<v Speaker 3>to these very ideas because of the way </v>

4122
03:00:00.871 --> 03:00:01.704
<v Speaker 3>he's presenting them because he's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>presenting them in a form that </v>

4123
03:00:04.661 --> 03:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>psychologically digestible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

4124
03:00:06.990 --> 03:00:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4125
03:00:07.350 --> 03:00:08.183
<v Speaker 4>and also fundamentally he creates the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotype of scientists that is being </v>

4126
03:00:11.581 --> 03:00:12.414
<v Speaker 4>formed around him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is that well is that they're </v>

4127
03:00:15.271 --> 03:00:16.500
<v Speaker 4>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive.</v>

4128
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:18.260
<v Speaker 4>They doesn't seem aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4129
03:00:18.270 --> 03:00:19.260
<v Speaker 4>he seems aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

4130
03:00:19.290 --> 03:00:20.123
<v Speaker 4>It's not about really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was the point of like </v>

4131
03:00:21.570 --> 03:00:22.403
<v Speaker 4>spending time in at oaks Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not really about how I was </v>

4132
03:00:25.021 --> 03:00:26.740
<v Speaker 4>perceiving them because I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it.</v>

4133
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.943
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are people that are pushing a </v>

4134
03:00:29.571 --> 03:00:34.571
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous ideology and the enemies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ridiculous ideology they attack.</v>

4135
03:00:36.050 --> 03:00:37.700
<v Speaker 3>They're attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the basic,</v>

4136
03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:39.950
<v Speaker 3>the basic problem is attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4137
03:00:39.951 --> 03:00:44.750
<v Speaker 3>But it's a very small segment of mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools that are doing this.</v>

4138
03:00:44.751 --> 03:00:45.584
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about how many people </v>

4139
03:00:46.251 --> 03:00:48.860
<v Speaker 3>believe Christian school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people believe in evolution?</v>

4140
03:00:49.090 --> 03:00:51.100
<v Speaker 3>It was probably a giant number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4141
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.943
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4142
03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:54.800
<v Speaker 3>you can look at different polls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like 50 slash 50.</v>

4143
03:00:54.890 --> 03:00:55.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like 46 percent according </v>

4144
03:00:57.291 --> 03:00:59.590
<v Speaker 3>to a recent Gallup poll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my joke was always like,</v>

4145
03:00:59.860 --> 03:01:00.010
<v Speaker 3>who</v>

4146
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>the fuck answer is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul's mean,</v>

4147
03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>is it like one out of 100 at triggered </v>
<v Speaker 1>last night?</v>

4148
03:01:05.230 --> 03:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4149
03:01:05.650 --> 03:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>The people dumb enough to answer polls </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets,</v>

4150
03:01:07.441 --> 03:01:08.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One percent,</v>

4151
03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately that's the,</v>

4152
03:01:11.230 --> 03:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4153
03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:13.173
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger thing that I would like to </v>

4154
03:01:14.801 --> 03:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>achieve is a scientific reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4155
03:01:18.610 --> 03:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the,</v>

4156
03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther triggers this,</v>

4157
03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>this reformation with the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>church and all that sort of stuff.</v>

4158
03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:27.933
<v Speaker 1>At the cornerstone of the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church was this idea of love </v>

4159
03:01:29.951 --> 03:01:30.784
<v Speaker 1>they neighbor as thyself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically Martin Luther said the </v>

4160
03:01:32.651 --> 03:01:33.484
<v Speaker 1>people in the power in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the religious establishment are not </v>

4161
03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>living that principle right at the core </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sciences.</v>

4162
03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>This idea that we should be responsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to evidence,</v>

4163
03:01:43.060 --> 03:01:43.893
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4164
03:01:44.050 --> 03:01:44.883
<v Speaker 1>And the scientific establishment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>often not living or the academic </v>

4165
03:01:47.351 --> 03:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>establishment is not living that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4166
03:01:49.390 --> 03:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4167
03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:51.453
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>

4168
03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4169
03:01:52.750 --> 03:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that left to their own devices,</v>

4170
03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:57.033
<v Speaker 1>they will continue to remain in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny lanes and a lot of these academic </v>

4171
03:01:59.741 --> 03:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>disputes can only be solved by going </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside their lanes.</v>

4172
03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Sam Harris was here,</v>

4173
03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:06.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've said this on the podcast with </v>

4174
03:02:08.021 --> 03:02:08.854
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that I wanted would want </v>

4175
03:02:10.361 --> 03:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that I would want to talk</v>

4176
03:02:12.101 --> 03:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>about is this rationalist versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuitionist idea and try and reach some</v>

4177
03:02:16.001 --> 03:02:16.834
<v Speaker 1>sort of definitive conclusion on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if Sam Harris is thinking and </v>

4178
03:02:20.051 --> 03:02:20.884
<v Speaker 1>feeling are always being linked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he has to decide how his feelings </v>

4179
03:02:24.551 --> 03:02:25.384
<v Speaker 1>about religion are driving his thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether his feelings about religion </v>

4180
03:02:28.661 --> 03:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>are appropriate in light of the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether they're not appropriate.</v>

4181
03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:34.090
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4182
03:02:34.091 --> 03:02:36.760
<v Speaker 1>religion as itself though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to you about evidence,</v>

4183
03:02:36.761 --> 03:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely lacking in that.</v>

4184
03:02:39.310 --> 03:02:40.143
<v Speaker 1>So what he's talking about is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are subscribing to a very rigid </v>

4185
03:02:43.391 --> 03:02:44.224
<v Speaker 1>ideology that he thinks is compromising </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in the same way that racism </v>

4186
03:02:48.491 --> 03:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>justifies the behavior of social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors.</v>

4187
03:02:51.730 --> 03:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

4188
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand,</v>

4189
03:02:54.850 --> 03:02:55.683
<v Speaker 1>I understood this but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this religious discrimination is </v>

4190
03:02:57.491 --> 03:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>based on an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's written on animal skins</v>

4191
03:03:02.381 --> 03:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>from thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually my ignorance.</v>

4192
03:03:05.380 --> 03:03:08.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's much more to that than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just saying that it's,</v>

4193
03:03:08.601 --> 03:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to racism will know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is that,</v>

4194
03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this is again,</v>

4195
03:03:14.471 --> 03:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a larger principle here,</v>

4196
03:03:17.770 --> 03:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find it in,</v>

4197
03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Heights' book,</v>

4198
03:03:20.351 --> 03:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>the happiness hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4199
03:03:21.701 --> 03:03:22.534
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that Jesus talked </v>

4200
03:03:23.291 --> 03:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>about a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4201
03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Which is that it's easy to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>splinter in my brother's eye,</v>

4202
03:03:28.511 --> 03:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but hard to see the log in my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in general,</v>

4203
03:03:31.271 --> 03:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4204
03:03:32.981 --> 03:03:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4205
03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson criticizes people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>College Campuses,</v>

4206
03:03:37.930 --> 03:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

4207
03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

4208
03:03:41.441 --> 03:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes on my show,</v>

4209
03:03:42.581 --> 03:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>he comes on your show and we all cheer </v>
<v Speaker 1>him on.</v>

4210
03:03:44.801 --> 03:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking great.</v>

4211
03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:47.193
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the reaction that Jordan </v>

4212
03:03:48.730 --> 03:03:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Peterson gets on his campus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mixed.</v>

4213
03:03:51.900 --> 03:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some were saluting him,</v>

4214
03:03:54.580 --> 03:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>some people were very upset at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

4215
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

4216
03:03:58.310 --> 03:04:00.170
<v Speaker 4>when I took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I challenged these,</v>

4217
03:04:00.171 --> 03:04:01.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the narco capitalists,</v>

4218
03:04:01.401 --> 03:04:02.990
<v Speaker 4>the libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff,</v>

4219
03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:04.033
<v Speaker 4>I got some people cheering me on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then a lot of people calling me </v>

4220
03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:09.020
<v Speaker 4>intellectually dishonest or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of stuff,</v>

4221
03:04:09.050 --> 03:04:11.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These arguments,</v>

4222
03:04:11.121 --> 03:04:14.150
<v Speaker 4>nobody is saying that these arguments as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they currently stand are easy.</v>

4223
03:04:14.151 --> 03:04:16.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of material to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4224
03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:17.480
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4225
03:04:17.890 --> 03:04:19.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my in,</v>

4226
03:04:19.321 --> 03:04:20.154
<v Speaker 4>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my job is to communicate them as </v>

4227
03:04:21.831 --> 03:04:25.270
<v Speaker 4>clearly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is,</v>

4228
03:04:25.271 --> 03:04:29.210
<v Speaker 4>is that if you want to move science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like science has a communication problem</v>

4229
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:30.343
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you read people in science like a </v>

4230
03:04:32.781 --> 03:04:34.940
<v Speaker 4>tool Guan Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll just be like,</v>

4231
03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:37.910
<v Speaker 4>people are fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science is complicated,</v>

4232
03:04:37.911 --> 03:04:38.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4233
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:39.343
<v Speaker 4>you going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go on these big broad journeys for </v>

4234
03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:42.890
<v Speaker 4>you come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4235
03:04:42.891 --> 03:04:43.724
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what I'm saying is that Sam Harris </v>

4236
03:04:46.251 --> 03:04:51.251
<v Speaker 4>and Richard Dawkins are the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends with friends like Sam Harris and</v>

4237
03:04:51.441 --> 03:04:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Richard Dawkins.</v>

4238
03:04:52.220 --> 03:04:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Science doesn't need enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are alienating,</v>

4239
03:04:55.820 --> 03:04:56.653
<v Speaker 4>they are not helping us and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting in the way of communicating </v>

4240
03:04:58.881 --> 03:04:59.714
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand because of the very </v>

4241
03:05:01.370 --> 03:05:02.203
<v Speaker 4>approach that they're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If science was to adopt the approach of </v>

4242
03:05:06.081 --> 03:05:08.600
<v Speaker 4>we are here in light of the diffusion of</v>
<v Speaker 4>innovations,</v>

4243
03:05:08.601 --> 03:05:09.434
<v Speaker 4>which is the book all about how you feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way about Neil degrasse Tyson </v>

4244
03:05:11.301 --> 03:05:12.134
<v Speaker 4>and is open criticism of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think in general that I don't </v>

4245
03:05:15.201 --> 03:05:18.140
<v Speaker 4>think that the criticism of religion is </v>
<v Speaker 4>helping science.</v>

4246
03:05:18.141 --> 03:05:18.974
<v Speaker 4>It's a hundred and 50 year old science </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been at war with religion for a </v>

4247
03:05:21.751 --> 03:05:22.584
<v Speaker 4>hundred and 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't think that science should </v>

4248
03:05:24.140 --> 03:05:26.530
<v Speaker 4>be honest or the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that will.</v>

4249
03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:28.840
<v Speaker 4>That scientists should be honest about </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own personal.</v>

4250
03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:30.033
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is is that I believe that </v>

4251
03:05:30.891 --> 03:05:31.724
<v Speaker 4>scientists should read science widely </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you look at someone like John </v>

4252
03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:35.233
<v Speaker 4>Height,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason why John Height and </v>

4253
03:05:36.201 --> 03:05:37.034
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris have fought is because John </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have a problem with religion </v>

4254
03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:42.350
<v Speaker 4>because when you update your view of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

4255
03:05:42.560 --> 03:05:43.393
<v Speaker 4>you come to realize that what's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on is that you blindly </v>

4256
03:05:46.551 --> 03:05:47.384
<v Speaker 4>internalized the beliefs of science and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your community and all that sort of </v>

4257
03:05:50.061 --> 03:05:50.894
<v Speaker 4>stuff and that they blindly internalized</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beliefs of their community and that </v>

4258
03:05:54.501 --> 03:05:58.400
<v Speaker 4>if you want to move ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to move scientific ideas,</v>

4259
03:05:58.640 --> 03:05:59.473
<v Speaker 4>what we have to do is establish trust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what specifically are they blindly </v>

4260
03:06:02.571 --> 03:06:03.404
<v Speaker 4>interpreting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's this idea of that reason and </v>

4261
03:06:05.841 --> 03:06:07.710
<v Speaker 4>emotion are separate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

4262
03:06:07.760 --> 03:06:12.440
<v Speaker 4>How does that apply strictly to religion</v>
<v Speaker 4>and beliefs on religion being incorrect?</v>

4263
03:06:12.441 --> 03:06:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Because if you look at the behavior of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalists,</v>

4264
03:06:14.751 --> 03:06:17.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get very into the,</v>

4265
03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:20.120
<v Speaker 4>the literal text in the wording and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of stuff.</v>

4266
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.983
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same thing with Sam Harris </v>

4267
03:06:22.791 --> 03:06:23.870
<v Speaker 4>and Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4268
03:06:23.871 --> 03:06:27.920
<v Speaker 4>They're super into like breaking apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does the Koran say?</v>

4269
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:30.200
<v Speaker 4>What does the Bible say and all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff,</v>

4270
03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:34.550
<v Speaker 4>and what really matters is what is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit in which it's being approached.</v>

4271
03:06:34.551 --> 03:06:36.080
<v Speaker 4>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel about these things?</v>

4272
03:06:36.081 --> 03:06:38.810
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at something like gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>

4273
03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:40.070
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or homosexuals,</v>

4274
03:06:40.100 --> 03:06:40.933
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does the Bible say on </v>

4275
03:06:41.721 --> 03:06:44.060
<v Speaker 4>homosexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4276
03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:46.820
<v Speaker 4>it says two totally different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4277
03:06:46.930 --> 03:06:49.400
<v Speaker 4>There's what it says about Sodom and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gomorrah.</v>

4278
03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:52.310
<v Speaker 4>And then there's what it says about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4279
03:06:52.311 --> 03:06:53.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love thy neighbor as thyself.</v>

4280
03:06:53.860 --> 03:06:55.500
<v Speaker 4>And if you hate gays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're to be like,</v>

4281
03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:56.970
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sodom and Gomorrah.</v>

4282
03:06:56.971 --> 03:06:58.170
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4283
03:06:58.380 --> 03:06:59.213
<v Speaker 4>And if you like gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a nice gay neighbor or </v>

4284
03:07:00.961 --> 03:07:01.740
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

4285
03:07:01.740 --> 03:07:03.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love thy neighbor as thyself.</v>

4286
03:07:03.240 --> 03:07:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the issue is not the text,</v>

4287
03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.580
<v Speaker 4>the issue is what does the person feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the thing,</v>

4288
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:09.863
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

4289
03:07:09.870 --> 03:07:11.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the psychology that is driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4290
03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the point is,</v>

4291
03:07:14.041 --> 03:07:16.230
<v Speaker 4>is that if you want to fix the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4292
03:07:16.560 --> 03:07:19.290
<v Speaker 4>you don't worry about the text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4293
03:07:19.291 --> 03:07:21.240
<v Speaker 4>You don't worry about what are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>literal.</v>

4294
03:07:21.350 --> 03:07:23.990
<v Speaker 2>The text is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be discussed.</v>

4295
03:07:24.290 --> 03:07:25.123
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if the taxed promotes violence </v>

4296
03:07:28.131 --> 03:07:28.964
<v Speaker 2>against women or against any particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>group that doesn't believe what you </v>

4297
03:07:32.901 --> 03:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>believe it's discussed because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic,</v>

4298
03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:36.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4299
03:07:36.810 --> 03:07:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Different people like has the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed in the last 400 years?</v>

4300
03:07:41.180 --> 03:07:42.013
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but different people's interpretations </v>

4301
03:07:42.921 --> 03:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>of the bibles have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4302
03:07:44.690 --> 03:07:45.523
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

4303
03:07:45.610 --> 03:07:47.020
<v Speaker 4>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4304
03:07:47.021 --> 03:07:48.520
<v Speaker 4>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at,</v>

4305
03:07:48.521 --> 03:07:49.354
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are Muslims now and where are </v>

4306
03:07:50.771 --> 03:07:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Christians now look at Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1600.</v>

4307
03:07:54.160 --> 03:07:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Well this is an issue that Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shermer wrote about recently about Islam</v>

4308
03:07:58.271 --> 03:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>not experiencing the enlightenment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other religions have gone through this.</v>

4309
03:08:02.490 --> 03:08:03.323
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's specifically about Islam </v>

4310
03:08:05.101 --> 03:08:06.940
<v Speaker 4>experiencing a D enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4311
03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:08.580
<v Speaker 4>Because in the year $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

4312
03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:11.640
<v Speaker 4>But so the real thing that if you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fix Islam,</v>

4313
03:08:11.641 --> 03:08:12.970
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

4314
03:08:12.990 --> 03:08:15.840
<v Speaker 4>I was born in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents live in Dubai.</v>

4315
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Like there are conversations happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

4316
03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:19.853
<v Speaker 4>What you have to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you have to change the </v>

4317
03:08:21.841 --> 03:08:23.760
<v Speaker 4>intellectual climate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>

4318
03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:27.480
<v Speaker 4>But the intellectual climate has nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do with the text.</v>

4319
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:30.720
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with a lot of what people </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe about learning what they believe</v>

4320
03:08:30.721 --> 03:08:31.554
<v Speaker 4>about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they find ideas threatening and </v>

4321
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:37.890
<v Speaker 4>the the text that when Islam in the year</v>
<v Speaker 4>1000,</v>

4322
03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:39.053
<v Speaker 4>right was the most intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced place on the planet and the </v>

4323
03:08:42.271 --> 03:08:45.900
<v Speaker 4>text that Islam is using now has not </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

4324
03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:47.033
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that people like Sam Harris and </v>

4325
03:08:49.141 --> 03:08:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get super caught up in the text,</v>

4326
03:08:52.050 --> 03:08:53.640
<v Speaker 4>but really if you want to fix these </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

4327
03:08:53.641 --> 03:08:54.750
<v Speaker 4>you have to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4328
03:08:54.751 --> 03:08:57.600
<v Speaker 4>what are your beliefs about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentional intelligence,</v>

4329
03:08:57.690 --> 03:08:59.520
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel about other cultures?</v>

4330
03:08:59.670 --> 03:09:00.503
<v Speaker 4>You have to talk about feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really where the conversation </v>

4331
03:09:03.091 --> 03:09:03.924
<v Speaker 4>changes and the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that rationalist don't talk about </v>

4332
03:09:06.511 --> 03:09:08.700
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the real.</v>

4333
03:09:08.730 --> 03:09:09.563
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is the core of what needs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen and the science is there to do </v>

4334
03:09:13.111 --> 03:09:14.410
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the point is,</v>

4335
03:09:14.411 --> 03:09:15.090
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4336
03:09:15.090 --> 03:09:15.923
<v Speaker 4>let's put these people side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Height has a following of </v>

4337
03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:20.130
<v Speaker 4>essentially zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4338
03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Richard Dawkins has a huge following,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4339
03:09:22.801 --> 03:09:25.950
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris has a big following.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone like Joe Henrich,</v>

4340
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably maybe has three twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers.</v>

4341
03:09:28.470 --> 03:09:30.870
<v Speaker 4>So the people who are representing </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

4342
03:09:30.871 --> 03:09:32.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

4343
03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:33.353
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's questioning like does Neil </v>

4344
03:09:34.561 --> 03:09:35.394
<v Speaker 4>degrasse tyson?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No way the fuck more about astrophysics </v>

4345
03:09:37.291 --> 03:09:38.124
<v Speaker 4>than I do 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know that Neil degrasse </v>

4346
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:43.020
<v Speaker 4>Tyson has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

4347
03:09:43.021 --> 03:09:43.854
<v Speaker 4>read the diffusion of innovations </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I will tell you that I've had </v>

4348
03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:48.960
<v Speaker 4>numerous academics on the podcast.</v>

4349
03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:50.400
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Sloan Wilson,</v>

4350
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:52.200
<v Speaker 4>David Sloan Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4351
03:09:52.230 --> 03:09:53.530
<v Speaker 4>I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4352
03:09:53.531 --> 03:09:58.531
<v Speaker 4>he sent me this thing back in 2014 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a 67 page paper and it said,</v>

4353
03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:00.873
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was towards a science of intentional </v>

4354
03:10:02.381 --> 03:10:03.214
<v Speaker 4>behavior change or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I read the 67 pages and at the end </v>

4355
03:10:06.551 --> 03:10:07.384
<v Speaker 4>of the 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>

4356
03:10:07.430 --> 03:10:08.710
<v Speaker 4>67 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4357
03:10:08.740 --> 03:10:09.573
<v Speaker 4>I feel like what you're actually talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about is how do you move ideas and </v>

4358
03:10:12.250 --> 03:10:16.060
<v Speaker 4>wasn't that already solved with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>diffusion of innovations?</v>

4359
03:10:16.570 --> 03:10:18.250
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4360
03:10:18.251 --> 03:10:19.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4361
03:10:19.121 --> 03:10:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I've obviously heard of the diffusion of</v>
<v Speaker 4>innovations.</v>

4362
03:10:21.551 --> 03:10:23.950
<v Speaker 4>Like Everett Rogers is literally famous </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

4363
03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:24.993
<v Speaker 4>but I've never made a close study of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the diffusion of innovations was </v>

4364
03:10:28.961 --> 03:10:33.370
<v Speaker 4>written in 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is an innovation that hasn't diffused</v>

4365
03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:37.510
<v Speaker 4>and that's specifically because even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though it's set practices,</v>

4366
03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:39.850
<v Speaker 4>it preaches one thing about how ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

4367
03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It's written in that dry scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>technical style.</v>

4368
03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:45.630
<v Speaker 4>So a guy like Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4369
03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:49.070
<v Speaker 4>or Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins or </v>
<v Speaker 4>David Sloan Wilson,</v>

4370
03:10:49.071 --> 03:10:51.100
<v Speaker 4>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Hyde or Joe Henrich or any of these</v>

4371
03:10:51.101 --> 03:10:51.934
<v Speaker 4>guys often have not heard of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are relevant to the conversations that </v>

4372
03:10:57.521 --> 03:11:00.370
<v Speaker 4>we're having.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not just that the ideas aren't</v>

4373
03:11:00.371 --> 03:11:01.210
<v Speaker 4>moving between them</v>

4374
03:11:01.220 --> 03:11:03.200
<v Speaker 2>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some bizarre conversation to have if you</v>

4375
03:11:03.201 --> 03:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>don't know whether or not they've read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

4376
03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:05.773
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can look at people's behavior </v>

4377
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:08.743
<v Speaker 4>and you can see from people's behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they understand certain things </v>

4378
03:11:11.241 --> 03:11:11.590
<v Speaker 4>or not,</v>

4379
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:13.300
<v Speaker 2>whether they agree with certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4380
03:11:13.301 --> 03:11:16.400
<v Speaker 2>just because their behavior doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't compatible to that paper.</v>

4381
03:11:16.401 --> 03:11:17.234
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that they haven't read </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and just decided that they don't </v>

4382
03:11:19.451 --> 03:11:21.130
<v Speaker 2>agree or they have another point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

4383
03:11:21.340 --> 03:11:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

4384
03:11:22.540 --> 03:11:23.480
<v Speaker 4>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4385
03:11:23.570 --> 03:11:25.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4386
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:26.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you immune,</v>

4387
03:11:26.110 --> 03:11:28.310
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to really get into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really</v>

4388
03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:29.390
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

4389
03:11:29.391 --> 03:11:30.550
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're way over,</v>

4390
03:11:30.610 --> 03:11:31.443
<v Speaker 2>we're like 25 minutes over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was trying to figure out a way to </v>

4391
03:11:33.760 --> 03:11:35.650
<v Speaker 2>skirt out of here quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4392
03:11:36.030 --> 03:11:37.350
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4393
03:11:37.700 --> 03:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>the point that I'm trying to the large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the main point is this,</v>

4394
03:11:41.581 --> 03:11:42.620
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4395
03:11:42.780 --> 03:11:45.180
<v Speaker 4>from all of our conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

4396
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:46.343
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are ideas out there trapped in </v>

4397
03:11:48.481 --> 03:11:49.314
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the whole point of what we're </v>

4398
03:11:50.431 --> 03:11:51.264
<v Speaker 4>doing on the brand calvin show that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>real practical value to improving </v>

4399
03:11:55.321 --> 03:11:56.154
<v Speaker 4>people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those ideas are not moving and part of </v>

4400
03:11:59.911 --> 03:11:59.990
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

4401
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:01.700
<v Speaker 2>don't you think they're all kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving?</v>

4402
03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Well right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is moving</v>

4403
03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:05.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

4404
03:12:05.310 --> 03:12:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so part of the diffusion of innovations,</v>

4405
03:12:07.861 --> 03:12:08.694
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the book opens with a story about </v>

4406
03:12:11.461 --> 03:12:12.660
<v Speaker 4>scurvy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4407
03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:14.610
<v Speaker 4>So scurvy is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4408
03:12:14.611 --> 03:12:16.710
<v Speaker 4>this problem that killed 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

4409
03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:17.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4410
03:12:17.821 --> 03:12:18.654
<v Speaker 4>it's all comes down to vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficiency and it's the simplest </v>

4411
03:12:20.671 --> 03:12:22.590
<v Speaker 4>solution in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just suck on a line.</v>

4412
03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:23.873
<v Speaker 4>So between scurvy being figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in a sort of academic context and </v>

4413
03:12:28.311 --> 03:12:33.311
<v Speaker 4>between it being applied 150 years past </v>
<v Speaker 4>150 years.</v>

4414
03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:37.380
<v Speaker 4>So the point is is that ideas don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

4415
03:12:37.381 --> 03:12:40.020
<v Speaker 4>Well they didn't have the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not even about that.</v>

4416
03:12:40.021 --> 03:12:40.420
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

4417
03:12:40.420 --> 03:12:41.253
<v Speaker 2>It isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean isn't that the best way to </v>

4418
03:12:42.101 --> 03:12:42.934
<v Speaker 2>distribute information as the internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it took 150 years for </v>

4419
03:12:46.361 --> 03:12:49.870
<v Speaker 2>scurvy to be cured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the information was there,</v>

4420
03:12:50.020 --> 03:12:53.690
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that directly coincides </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the lack of ability to express that</v>

4421
03:12:53.691 --> 03:12:54.524
<v Speaker 2>information?</v>

4422
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:56.800
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the point of the diffusion of</v>

4423
03:12:56.801 --> 03:12:57.634
<v Speaker 4>innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's has to do with the ideas being </v>

4424
03:12:58.811 --> 03:12:59.644
<v Speaker 4>packaged in a way that is culturally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologically compatible with what </v>

4425
03:13:04.211 --> 03:13:07.510
<v Speaker 4>people already believe and it being </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown that they have practical value.</v>

4426
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:11.010
<v Speaker 4>The basic barrier is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why have ideas?</v>

4427
03:13:11.050 --> 03:13:11.920
<v Speaker 4>Have these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4428
03:13:11.921 --> 03:13:12.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4429
03:13:12.670 --> 03:13:16.250
<v Speaker 4>the science of evolution has been around</v>
<v Speaker 4>for hundred and 50 years.</v>

4430
03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:18.280
<v Speaker 2>That vitamin C example that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>using,</v>

4431
03:13:18.281 --> 03:13:19.114
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited amount of education available </v>

4432
03:13:21.491 --> 03:13:24.010
<v Speaker 2>when people were not expressing them.</v>

4433
03:13:24.420 --> 03:13:25.021
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4434
03:13:25.021 --> 03:13:30.021
<v Speaker 4>Eighteen 47 in comparison to 2016 or 17 </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

4435
03:13:30.690 --> 03:13:31.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you've got 2 million people </v>

4436
03:13:32.341 --> 03:13:33.900
<v Speaker 4>dying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4437
03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:36.180
<v Speaker 4>There were 2 million people dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a huge problem.</v>

4438
03:13:36.181 --> 03:13:39.270
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know how to solve it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ideas didn't move.</v>

4439
03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:41.670
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how can you compare that to today?</v>

4440
03:13:41.970 --> 03:13:43.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4441
03:13:43.140 --> 03:13:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

4442
03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:45.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4443
03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't do the,</v>

4444
03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:49.470
<v Speaker 4>we can't do the experiment where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4445
03:13:49.471 --> 03:13:53.760
<v Speaker 4>we have one world where we don't move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't do anything to package and move</v>

4446
03:13:53.761 --> 03:13:54.594
<v Speaker 4>the ideas and we have another world </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we do actively work to try and </v>

4447
03:13:57.541 --> 03:13:59.670
<v Speaker 4>package and move these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't do that,</v>

4448
03:13:59.790 --> 03:14:03.120
<v Speaker 4>but it's 160 years difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is a different world.</v>

4449
03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:04.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology is different,</v>

4450
03:14:04.441 --> 03:14:05.274
<v Speaker 4>but the human mind hasn't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human mind hasn't changed really in </v>

4451
03:14:07.561 --> 03:14:08.640
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

4452
03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:11.790
<v Speaker 2>The human mind might not have changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically,</v>

4453
03:14:11.791 --> 03:14:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's understanding of the world has </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed radically.</v>

4454
03:14:14.041 --> 03:14:16.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's understanding of what a vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

4455
03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:17.993
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the different between you </v>

4456
03:14:19.891 --> 03:14:20.724
<v Speaker 4>understand well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's also important is that it's </v>

4457
03:14:22.201 --> 03:14:25.350
<v Speaker 4>important to realize that when this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole scurvy conversation was going on,</v>

4458
03:14:25.380 --> 03:14:26.213
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have the concept of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin and there are three concepts </v>

4459
03:14:28.831 --> 03:14:29.664
<v Speaker 4>that you don't have right now in terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this idea that thinking and feeling </v>

4460
03:14:32.941 --> 03:14:33.960
<v Speaker 4>are always linked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4461
03:14:33.961 --> 03:14:34.794
<v Speaker 4>This idea of descartes' error,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not our culture doesn't talk </v>

4462
03:14:37.591 --> 03:14:39.810
<v Speaker 4>about emotions in a way where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>

4463
03:14:40.050 --> 03:14:40.883
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this behavior of the student where they </v>

4464
03:14:41.650 --> 03:14:43.230
<v Speaker 4>bought up the test and they throw it all</v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

4465
03:14:43.231 --> 03:14:46.380
<v Speaker 4>That is being driven by an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people understand that though,</v>

4466
03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:47.210
<v Speaker 4>do they?</v>

4467
03:14:47.210 --> 03:14:48.043
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people understand that people </v>

4468
03:14:49.281 --> 03:14:52.580
<v Speaker 2>get humiliated by failure and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them pull back,</v>

4469
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:53.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't grow.</v>

4470
03:14:53.751 --> 03:14:54.584
<v Speaker 2>And when people teach people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that people </v>

4471
03:14:56.031 --> 03:14:56.864
<v Speaker 2>teach about when learning new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information to make an encouraging and </v>

4472
03:15:00.411 --> 03:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>to make it enjoyable and to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundless potential and not express,</v>

4473
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear,</v>

4474
03:15:06.711 --> 03:15:07.544
<v Speaker 2>rigid boundaries that you're never going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cross and that you can impart these </v>

4475
03:15:10.791 --> 03:15:11.624
<v Speaker 2>very limiting ideas into children's </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds or you can expand upon their </v>

4476
03:15:14.931 --> 03:15:15.764
<v Speaker 2>potential horizons by promoting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of accessibility and have have </v>

4477
03:15:19.700 --> 03:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>massive potential</v>

4478
03:15:20.770 --> 03:15:23.720
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it a standard practice in America</v>

4479
03:15:23.721 --> 03:15:24.554
<v Speaker 4>schools today when a student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a student gets a bad tests that we </v>

4480
03:15:28.361 --> 03:15:30.640
<v Speaker 4>all work through those mistakes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyze them.</v>

4481
03:15:30.820 --> 03:15:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

4482
03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:34.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just shitty teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a matter of lack of </v>

4483
03:15:37.421 --> 03:15:38.254
<v Speaker 2>understanding amongst certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals about the way people are </v>

4484
03:15:40.541 --> 03:15:41.980
<v Speaker 2>motivated and not motivated.</v>

4485
03:15:42.210 --> 03:15:43.043
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there may be a small number of </v>

4486
03:15:43.561 --> 03:15:44.394
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that that is the </v>

4487
03:15:45.361 --> 03:15:46.194
<v Speaker 4>general consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if it's a small </v>

4488
03:15:47.581 --> 03:15:49.560
<v Speaker 4>number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a fairly number.</v>

4489
03:15:49.561 --> 03:15:50.190
<v Speaker 4>It's just not</v>

4490
03:15:50.190 --> 03:15:51.023
<v Speaker 1>the consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that Asian cultures do </v>

4491
03:15:52.651 --> 03:15:56.400
<v Speaker 1>better in school than American culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably discipline,</v>

4492
03:15:56.670 --> 03:15:58.590
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of it is that faith and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

4493
03:15:58.591 --> 03:15:59.424
<v Speaker 1>they really believe practice makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and if you work hard at </v>

4494
03:16:01.261 --> 03:16:03.420
<v Speaker 1>something that you'll get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also cultural,</v>

4495
03:16:03.421 --> 03:16:05.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is called talking about it for you.</v>

4496
03:16:05.821 --> 03:16:06.654
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't have that culture today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that faith that if you </v>

4497
03:16:09.751 --> 03:16:12.450
<v Speaker 1>bust your ass and you really work hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll get better.</v>

4498
03:16:12.690 --> 03:16:15.360
<v Speaker 1>They did have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have that idea.</v>

4499
03:16:15.390 --> 03:16:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Some do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant generalization,</v>

4500
03:16:17.930 --> 03:16:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but look at the reserve funds don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

4501
03:16:20.041 --> 03:16:20.874
<v Speaker 1>but look at the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americas are massive hotbed of </v>

4502
03:16:23.380 --> 03:16:24.213
<v Speaker 1>innovation and creativity and art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the part which part of America </v>

4503
03:16:27.601 --> 03:16:29.700
<v Speaker 1>in particular as a massive hotbed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

4504
03:16:29.850 --> 03:16:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Which subculture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's silicon valley.</v>

4505
03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly innovative.</v>

4506
03:16:34.981 --> 03:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>What about the artistic community?</v>

4507
03:16:36.330 --> 03:16:39.480
<v Speaker 1>What about music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's massive amounts of comedy,</v>

4508
03:16:39.690 --> 03:16:41.700
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

4509
03:16:41.701 --> 03:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's coming from America.</v>

4510
03:16:43.571 --> 03:16:45.750
<v Speaker 1>All total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all corners of the spot.</v>

4511
03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time is the,</v>

4512
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't American students doing well </v>

4513
03:16:51.481 --> 03:16:54.090
<v Speaker 1>in school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty students or Shitty,</v>

4514
03:16:54.250 --> 03:16:55.740
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty teachers rather.</v>

4515
03:16:55.770 --> 03:16:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Shitty culture and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4516
03:16:57.271 --> 03:16:58.104
<v Speaker 1>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also a lack of a lack of resources </v>

4517
03:17:00.691 --> 03:17:03.270
<v Speaker 1>being applied to schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4518
03:17:03.271 --> 03:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you find out what a teacher's salary is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you front out how little they.</v>

4519
03:17:06.231 --> 03:17:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They're respected women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue for sure.</v>

4520
03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

4521
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I think we absolutely agree on that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a large part of it is that there are,</v>

4522
03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:13.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are complicated fixes like fixing </v>

4523
03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:19.290
<v Speaker 1>how much we pay teachers and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff and there are simple fixes</v>

4524
03:17:19.380 --> 03:17:24.270
<v Speaker 1>and things that we can fix pretty simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideas that you can promote our,</v>

4525
03:17:24.330 --> 03:17:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace your mistakes,</v>

4526
03:17:25.771 --> 03:17:27.660
<v Speaker 1>analyze your mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail forward,</v>

4527
03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:28.733
<v Speaker 1>and that is the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the cornerstone value of the </v>

4528
03:17:30.481 --> 03:17:31.314
<v Speaker 1>FAA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you're safer flying than </v>

4529
03:17:32.581 --> 03:17:33.414
<v Speaker 1>walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cornerstone valley value of </v>

4530
03:17:35.131 --> 03:17:35.964
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley and I will tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>having worked with lots and lots of </v>

4531
03:17:38.611 --> 03:17:40.620
<v Speaker 1>students and traveled all across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

4532
03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:44.340
<v Speaker 1>that is not the core value of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American students.</v>

4533
03:17:44.420 --> 03:17:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Then we got to wrap this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

4534
03:17:46.260 --> 03:17:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's already 5:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in trouble.</v>

4535
03:17:48.390 --> 03:17:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4536

<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

4537
03:17:50.410 --> 03:17:51.243
<v Speaker 1>Do it again man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you've got a lot more to </v>

4538
03:17:52.091 --> 03:17:53.320
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shock though.</v>

4539
03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucks Cmr.</v>
