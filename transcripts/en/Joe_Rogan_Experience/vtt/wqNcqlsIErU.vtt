00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 2>So in part there's an empirical question here,</v>

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:06.140
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know the answer to.</v>

4
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 2>In Europe,</v>

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 2>they ban in most of them they ban hate speech.</v>

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.020
<v Speaker 2>So a or you know,</v>

7
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:12.890
<v Speaker 2>a Holocaust denial.</v>

8
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things that are illegal.</v>

9
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:14.954
<v Speaker 2>It's a crime.</v>

10
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and in America we don't,</v>

12
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 2>now it's an empirical question,</v>

13
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 2>meaning it's open to actual investigation.</v>

14
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

15
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 2>does banning it,</v>

16
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 2>push it underground and let the people feel that they are victims of being</v>

17
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>silencing something come back stronger or is certainly the best disinfectant.</v>

18
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

20
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

21
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I think in general,</v>

22
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the American system has worked better,</v>

23
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know their scholars who could,</v>

24
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>who could address that as for what is happening to the left is the left more</v>

25
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.143
<v Speaker 2>intolerant.</v>

26
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

28
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that you would think the left would be more open and in my</v>

29
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.331
<v Speaker 2>research on left,</v>

30
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

31
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>the left is generally higher and openness to experience the idea of dissent.</v>

32
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Dissent is patriotic.</v>

33
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>These are leftist ideas,</v>

34
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

35
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.181
<v Speaker 2>not right.</v>

36
00:00:58.181 --> 00:00:58.551
<v Speaker 2>This idea.</v>

37
00:00:58.551 --> 00:00:59.001
<v Speaker 2>So the left,</v>

38
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 2>it should be more open.</v>

39
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Problem is any group that,</v>

40
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 2>any group that loses a variety that loses diversity,</v>

41
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>any group in which everybody thinks the same is at risk of,</v>

42
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 2>of turning it into an ideology of turning to her religion.</v>

43
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.601
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 2>and then you lose the ability to think straight.</v>

45
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 2>And now if somebody,</v>

46
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

47
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 2>when I was in college at Yale,</v>

48
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody sort of leaned left,</v>

50
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.241
<v Speaker 2>but there was,</v>

51
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 2>they were conservatives,</v>

52
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 2>there were some conservative professors,</v>

53
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>like I'd been exposed to some conservative ideas.</v>

54
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>But now if you're in a college that has essentially no conservatives that we'll</v>

55
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>put out ideas and you encounter one,</v>

56
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 2>now it's much more painful.</v>

57
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>It's much more shocking.</v>

58
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.161
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

59
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:40.994
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

60
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have a peanut allergy to ideas that are not your groups and we</v>

61
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:44.751
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

62
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:45.584
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

63
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible if we're putting young people in systems that are basically giving</v>

64
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 2>them ideological peanut allergies,</v>

65
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>but most fighters are hard headed and are in a position to be hardheaded.</v>

66
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the hard part is like you trying to tell them,</v>

67
00:01:58.791 --> 00:01:59.001
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

68
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you need to listen to me right now.</v>

69
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

70
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

71
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.281
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

72
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And then their careers just,</v>

73
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy cause that's what made them a fighter in the first place.</v>

74
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Tell him to fuck off.</v>

76
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.321
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

77
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Stepfather beat their ass and they left the house and there's 16 fucked you.</v>

78
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll show the world fucking girl,</v>

79
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>don't dumb in high school.</v>

80
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.383
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

81
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>then next thing I know I'm out there and then fucking get in the cage.</v>

82
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for dudes who didn't get dumped.</v>

83
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

84
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Why that?</v>

85
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's good for you.</v>

86
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>It taught me a lot,</v>

88
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

89
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I remember my girlfriend in high school and dumped me.</v>

90
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I was devastated for months.</v>

91
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Just devastated.</v>

92
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized like what the Fuck is wrong with me?</v>

93
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.001
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

94
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>imagine if I'd married that girl magic.</v>

95
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I've had kids with her and Ooh.</v>

96
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And every day was just torture her bitching at me and controlling and oh I got</v>

97
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

98
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I got off light.</v>

99
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Well here's one for you to enjoy.</v>

100
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>same thing happened to me.</v>

102
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I got dumped in high school.</v>

103
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>The girl started dating another dude.</v>

105
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I ended up hitting this motherfucker and hit with a wrench.</v>

106
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And I hit the motherfucking hair with a wrench.</v>

108
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you hit him in the head with a wrench?</v>

109
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>He pissed me off.</v>

110
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

111
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.711
<v Speaker 1>he pissed me.</v>

112
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>He made me so mad.</v>

113
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Did he make you mad cause he was banging the grow or do you make you mad on top</v>

114
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>

115
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

116
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.903
<v Speaker 1>on top of that.</v>

117
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.950
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up hitting him and then I ended up going to jail to,</v>

119
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and I ended up doing 52 weekends in jail.</v>

120
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

121
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>But within that time,</v>

122
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.201
<v Speaker 1>every week,</v>

123
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>every weekend I had to go in on Friday,</v>

124
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>four year,</v>

125

<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't leave.</v>

127
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't leave my city.</v>

128
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>So in that time I taught myself how to fight.</v>

129
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here today.</v>

130
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.253
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

131
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>And during the weekends?</v>

132
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.391
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

133
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>during the week,</v>

136
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.391
<v Speaker 1>cause I couldn't leave,</v>

137
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.224
<v Speaker 1>so I would just,</v>

144
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.760
<v Speaker 1>watching videotapes.</v>

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

150
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what I came from.</v>

151
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what I came for us?</v>

152
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:55.624
<v Speaker 1>He's proven.</v>

153
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

154
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.903
<v Speaker 1>That's where it came from.</v>

155
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>That Peruvian necktie is a mother fucker.</v>

157
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a great move.</v>

158
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>That was Tony Shit.</v>

159
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

160
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I incorporate that.</v>

161
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>And on one of my systems,</v>

162
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:04.721
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

163
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I loved that movie was a hell of a grappler.</v>

164
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So he ended up choking out a Paul Rodriguez,</v>

167
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>UFC 32 and that was in that I got knocked out by Bj.</v>

168
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

169
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>But it all happened because I got dumped.</v>

170
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

171
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

172
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those things where you,</v>

174
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.771
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

175
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>when you look back and you think of all the great things that you did</v>

176
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:27.821
<v Speaker 1>accomplish,</v>

177
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>then you realize that you're retired at 30.</v>

178
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So much,</v>

180
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>so much room there,</v>

181
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>thirties so young.</v>

183
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>You're in your athletic prime.</v>

184
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

185
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I think they say 32 for a professional fighter.</v>

186
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>They consider most athletic primes.</v>

187
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

188
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>It's that</v>

189
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.323
<v Speaker 3>32.</v>

190
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.911
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

191
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

192
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.871
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

193
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I look back on it and again,</v>

194
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:46.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 3>the 42 fights,</v>

196
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:48.140
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of fights.</v>

197
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.383
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

198
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 3>plus I started when I was nine.</v>

199
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I had a little over a hundred amateur fights during,</v>

200
00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:55.310
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot with that.</v>

201
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:55.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

202
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 3>for a while there'd be a while before I retired.</v>

203
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I was throwing it around,</v>

204
00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:00.374
<v Speaker 3>retiring.</v>

206
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I was one of them guys that just,</v>

207
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I liked it and I loved it,</v>

208
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:06.470
<v Speaker 3>but I also sometimes got tired of it.</v>

209
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very simple guy and,</v>

210
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:09.800
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

211
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.633
<v Speaker 3>it don't,</v>

212
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about the Glam or to fame or any of that.</v>

213
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I truly don't,</v>

214
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

215
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 3>like even now what my,</v>

216
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 3>my podcast and what I'm doing with some of these other adventures because I got</v>

217
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 3>bored and I'm on to have fun.</v>

218
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

219
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

220
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 3>And keep myself busy.</v>

221
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

222
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I've been fortunate to have what I have to be able to do all this on my own,</v>

224
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

225
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 3>and go out there and be around everybody.</v>

226
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.741
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

227
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 3>so when I was fighting,</v>

228
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of rumors around up to retirement,</v>

230
00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:40.191
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

231
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.024
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

232
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.290
<v Speaker 3>and I think the final icing on a cake was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward</v>

233
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 3>and that's when Andre Ward ended up getting a sh,</v>

234
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 3>a shoulder surgery.</v>

235
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And that flight fell through.</v>

236
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 3>And I had been out in California training or an Ochsner trainer for almost a</v>

237
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.510
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

238
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 3>which fighters leave at the beginning of their career.</v>

239
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

240
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 3>when they don't have a family,</v>

241
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 3>when they're not making the money,</v>

242
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 3>that's our opportunity to try and go and make money that when you're 12 years</v>

243
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>

244
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

245
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.473
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

246
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 3>so I went out there and that kind of took a little bit from here as far as the</v>

247
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:13.161
<v Speaker 3>sport,</v>

248
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 3>even though I loved it and it was great training with Robert Garcia.</v>

249
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I learned so much that didn't think I could learn at that point in my career.</v>

250
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.090
<v Speaker 3>And when that,</v>

251
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>that Andre Ward fight fell through,</v>

252
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

253
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.681
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

254
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I was done.</v>

255
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

256
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.504
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

257
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.591
<v Speaker 3>I rolled over,</v>

258
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.161
<v Speaker 3>I never forget,</v>

259
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 3>I rolled over and told my wife,</v>

260
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:29.451
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

261
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.284
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm done.</v>

262
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.101
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

263
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

264
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>And as,</v>

265
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>and I think I'm retiring and she started crying tears of joy because she wanted</v>

266
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 3>me to be done even before that.</v>

267
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>She don't know to sport or what,</v>

268
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 3>what prime ages or not.</v>

269
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.783
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

270
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.641
<v Speaker 3>I hung them up and,</v>

271
00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:45.231
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

272
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.064
<v Speaker 3>over the years,</v>

273
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 3>as we talked earlier here who I would get the itch,</v>

274
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

275
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 3>and that could have been just going to the gym and Aetna are doing around on the</v>

276
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.254
<v Speaker 3>pads.</v>

277
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.891
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

278
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't ever want it to keep doing it.</v>

279
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:57.381
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

280
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:57.981
<v Speaker 3>my health,</v>

281
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not is more important than anything else.</v>

282
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Spaces fake.</v>

283
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

284
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

285
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>this is different than the flat earthers little Hashtag spaces,</v>

286
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>fake hashtag spaces.</v>

287
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Faith is people that are so fucking stupid.</v>

288
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 1>The flat earthers kicked him out.</v>

289
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.893
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

290
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>For real flat earthers kicked out the space.</v>

291
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Fake people spaces fake is,</v>

292
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

293
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>they're the most skeptical.</v>

294
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>So what would be the upper atmosphere?</v>

295
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:22.961
<v Speaker 1>Would be the edge.</v>

296
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:23.794
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit.</v>

297
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>

298
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It's the end.</v>

299
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's tied in some weird way to religion,</v>

300
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.220
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting because even the flat earth people,</v>

301
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:33.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of them that are extremely religious and they talk</v>

302
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>about the from Amen,</v>

303
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the Bible and the Bible,</v>

304
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 1>and that this is a,</v>

305
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>this is what's really going on is that they're trying to keep us from the</v>

306
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that God has created.</v>

307
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.280
<v Speaker 1>This place is a very special place.</v>

308
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

309
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>and so by pretending that it's round,</v>

310
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they somehow or another are controlling us.</v>

311
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking that we're not exceptional and we're not lucky space.</v>

312
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It's fake.</v>

313
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.000
<v Speaker 1>They're using a video from that Ryan Gosling's movie he just made about Neil</v>

314
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.001
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong,</v>

315
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>the first man on the moon.</v>

316
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Just be like this.</v>

318
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.401
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

319
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:03.581
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

320
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:04.414
<v Speaker 1>here's proof.</v>

321
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] fake everything.</v>

322
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They're making a movie because of the way they made the movie is that's evidence</v>

323
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that it's fake.</v>

324
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>That because he's wearing it.</v>

325
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if maybe this person doesn't recognize that as being Ryan Gosling</v>

326
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.323
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

327
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 1>She's got an NASA suit on.</v>

328
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a troll account.</v>

329
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>This is how NASA fix everything.</v>

330
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>This is the video I was talking about guys.</v>

331
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Now you know it's all a big act passed.</v>

332
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>This is fake.</v>

333
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Click on spaces fake though.</v>

334
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

335
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

336
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.061
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm on.</v>

337
00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:31.894
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the whole yeah,</v>

338
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but I mean click on it because there's a bunch of other warm on that thread.</v>

339
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount of people that literally believe that space is not</v>

340
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:39.760
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

341
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like that with alligators in Florida tail.</v>

342
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.181
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

344
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:43.650
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

345
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

346
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 1>an endangered species.</v>

347
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>They would ask us to please not feed them marshmallows.</v>

348
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause I lived in Gainesville right by this place called Lake Alice Lake outside</v>

349
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.743
<v Speaker 1>alligators.</v>

350
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Fucking 11 years old.</v>

351
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I was living an alligator's.</v>

352
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

353
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.870
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

354
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It was a goddamn dinosaur.</v>

355
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>But there was a small population of them cause they had been whacked into</v>

356
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 2>oblivion before and people would make it suitcases out of him.</v>

357
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made him a protected</v>

358
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.461
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

359
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>But then they fucked up.</v>

360
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>They over protected.</v>

361
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And those goddamn super lizards are everywhere now.</v>

362
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Fucking everywhere.</v>

363
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>My mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives.</v>

364
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>And there's this alligator's apparently like this fucking 14 foot alligator.</v>

365
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.953
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

366
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 2>the people were playing golf and there was a deer.</v>

367
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.111
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's on the,</v>

368
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>everybody's standing there going like,</v>

369
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a deer.</v>

370
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.083
<v Speaker 2>It's a deer.</v>

371
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Look at that beautiful fucking alligator comes out,</v>

372
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 2>grabs it,</v>

373
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 2>pulls it into the water,</v>

374
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 2>does that spin move?</v>

375
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Takes it to the bottom.</v>

376
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Fucking done.</v>

377
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's talking about it.</v>

378
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>What do we do about it?</v>

379
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>So about three weeks later,</v>

380
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the</v>

381
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:56.691
<v Speaker 2>alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge</v>

382
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 2>and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead,</v>

383
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 2>some dead grass.</v>

384
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:07.971
<v Speaker 2>And he gave out and she fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.</v>

385
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and</v>

386
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 2>grabbing at the reeds to get out of there.</v>

387
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:17.521
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

388
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

389
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and the people that she was with had left,</v>

390
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 2>she was playing by herself for some reason and she fucking got out of there and</v>

391
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 2>got in the cart and,</v>

392
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 2>and then she just started laughing.</v>

393
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.793
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

394
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>You believe that shit.</v>

395
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.520

396
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.260
