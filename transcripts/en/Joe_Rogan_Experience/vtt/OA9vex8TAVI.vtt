WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the answer,</v>

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>a real solid answer for the tail summons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird that Bj would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not have a guard like that,</v>

4
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that he wouldn't have this Ninja </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin guard?</v>

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know why?</v>

7
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Because he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I,</v>

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and I would say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've told this to Bj,</v>

9
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>tell him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

10
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>if you stay at 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no reason to master any </v>

11
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get back up.</v>

12
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking ever be better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody standing up.</v>

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody at 55 can take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even big wrestlers can't take you down.</v>

14
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I even thought he doesn't need a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really need to focus on his </v>

15
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he didn't need to develop an.</v>

16
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't even know it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in the rubber guard and he </v>

17
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>fucks with it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

18
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he felt like no one's going to </v>

19
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>put me on my fucking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe now,</v>

20
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>now that he knows like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fighters are getting so much </v>

21
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>better and there's so many wrestlers out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>you really have to have the answer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chael Sonnen and for like Frankie Edgar </v>

23
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>for these elite wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did to Florian,</v>

25
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>he took him down and got on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they talk about your garden,</v>

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the only answer for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the elite wrestler,</v>

27
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all over the top 10 of every UFC</v>

28
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>weight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only aunts or one of the only.</v>

29
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>There's only a couple of answers and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them is having a.</v>

30
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>When they talk about your guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't say that.</v>

31
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:25.311
<v Speaker 1>It's just a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got an okay guard at a decent </v>

32
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:25.311
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to say,</v>

33
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>your guard is a fucking amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't go in his garden.</v>

34
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Your Garden has to be like Ryan Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your guard has to be Shinier Yolk.</v>

35
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to fucking be in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag raid like Anthony Pettis and Shane </v>

36
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Roller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Anthony Pettis slapped on that </v>

37
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

38
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a super dangerous car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they are not.</v>

39
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>If people don't talk about your guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's amazing and it's fucking crazy</v>

40
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>

41
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best guards in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>division,</v>

42
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>then you're not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the answer for the elite </v>

43
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>wrestler most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you throw up a,</v>

44
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

45
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you know a pop triangle and it lands </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson Silva made it work in the </v>

46
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.081
<v Speaker 1>fifth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chris Leben made that pop triangle </v>

47
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>work and you know the Nogueira style of </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle at work that works.</v>

48
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It does work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not at the highest rate.</v>

49
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of the things that you </v>

50
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>could do as well to add to that already </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

51
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those Nogueira triangles,</v>

52
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you could mix it all up.</v>

53
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at what Shinya Aoki has done.</v>

54
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Look at what Dustin Hayzlett has done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what Matt Horwitz has done.</v>

55
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Just pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out there.</v>

56
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You can watch it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it too.</v>

57
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You need to have the answer for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite wrestler and man,</v>

58
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>having a crazy wicked guard can be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

59
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>What is the image name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony and I ran into James.</v>

60
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that you lived in.</v>

61
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pulling for him at first.</v>

62
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that box.</v>

63
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought that these MMA guys really </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know these.</v>

64
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>When you're a boxer in you're that high </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of a boxer,</v>

65
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know.</v>

66
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>These guys get hit and their hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the timing of this shit.</v>

67
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>But when I watched the countdown was </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was like,</v>

68
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>he didn't work.</v>

69
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>He didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a great opportunity to represent </v>

70
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't work.</v>

71
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't think you've worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost a lot of weight.</v>

72
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>He lost 15 pounds a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>If you're rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

74
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>student law 60 in a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really fucking roll.</v>

75
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you take this guy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got four months,</v>

76
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>the first month or you're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

77
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not working his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already there.</v>

78
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically working and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and just rolling little things.</v>

79
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Just surviving on my back right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are bad.</v>

80
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to judo when I was a kid.</v>

81
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I was skinny as shit because the hardest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about judo is flipping.</v>

82
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It's every time you get up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get up and down.</v>

83
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>50 Times a day that you get skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy didn't do that.</v>

84
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>He got some guy from the FBI to come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and train them.</v>

85
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>You know what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

86
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm in.</v>

87
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Hollywood with Ladell.</v>

88
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rolling with Einstein.</v>

89
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to Bro?</v>

90
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much can I learn?</v>

91
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And four months to get me out of a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm learning.</v>

92
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know.</v>

93
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a guy from the FBI that God knows</v>

94
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>that they fucking paid up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the guy who trained him to Kenpo</v>

95
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:15.721
<v Speaker 1>videos of him online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Campo with guys that come behind </v>

96
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>him and cut his legs and stuff and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was trained,</v>

97
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>James Tony that's on the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say James.</v>

98
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Tony actually doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>he looked the guy set up a program for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

101
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>but what does the guy know for real?</v>

102
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he really needed to do is go to </v>

103
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Colorado Springs and train at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic training center.</v>

104
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>He needed to get a guy who's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu master to come with them.</v>

105
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are going to take you down.</v>

106
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>He going to do your best to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take down.</v>

107
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Then once they get you taken down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to work at guard.</v>

108
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:42.331
<v Speaker 1>That's what you need to get down and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to submit those bureau a motherfucking </v>

109
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I watch the countdown show,</v>

110
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>what was very clear to me is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who was working out with,</v>

111
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>we're letting him do things for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and that it was.</v>

112
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:58.670
<v Speaker 1>They weren't elite grapplers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were letting him do things like,</v>

113
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

114
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anytime you change roles all over,</v>

115
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

116
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he's doing this.</v>

117
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were like letting him do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

118
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>They're putting on a show and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>james throw them around.</v>

119
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is silly.</v>

120
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:14.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not know anything about </v>

121
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:16.141
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this dude that found Hobby </v>

122
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:16.141
<v Speaker 1>Vasquez back at my first king of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage show in 2000.</v>

123
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>He comes out in claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.</v>

124
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>He's this French karate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought back then he just started</v>

125
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just say shit like that.</v>

126
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the.</v>

127
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He said he's been training Jujitsu 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and he's a black belt under hoists</v>

128
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was telling Carrie </v>

129
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>trouble cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Terry's got,</v>

130
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got a live one here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls the police Gracie Academy.</v>

131
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>They never heard of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's bullshitting.</v>

132
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to scare harvey into going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground with them.</v>

133
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And Hobby was a purple belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

134
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>did Matt destroyer on the local southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>California scene,</v>

135
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>he would've gone to Santa Santa Cruz as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and smash.</v>

136
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 1>He was the fucking destroyer of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purple belts division and there wasn't </v>

137
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.181
<v Speaker 1>very many browns and blacks at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and he was going to go against </v>

138
00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy who claimed to be a black belt </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude habit.</v>

139
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Took them down and like the guy had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>training dude,</v>

140
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>zero has used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just laid flat on his back and he tap </v>

141
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>really crooked hobby powder in them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of times.</v>

142
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>He just kept and it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

143
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting story,</v>

144
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.671
<v Speaker 1>but a much more interesting story is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy that we know that claim to be </v>

145
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:19.211
<v Speaker 1>a Brazilian jujitsu black belt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really didn't know anything that turned </v>

146
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:19.211
<v Speaker 1>out to be a murderer.</v>

147
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a dude we knew his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fake name was Raphael Tory.</v>

149
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But his real name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his real name?</v>

150
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

151
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>But he told people he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>he taught karate karate his whole life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he taught karate and he told people </v>

153
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>he was a black belt in Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

154
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but this Guy Eddie was hanging around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this guy.</v>

155
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>He was doing Brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it was a website,</v>

156
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

157
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a writer.</v>

158
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.701
<v Speaker 1>He was probably one of the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists back down on the </v>

159
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:52.091
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ralph El Toro was all over the </v>

160
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:52.091
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 2000.</v>

161
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It was still in the dark ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't easy for a guy to bust up </v>

162
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>and he was on speed all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this until years later.</v>

163
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>So he would work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would always have shit and pride </v>

164
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>loved them.</v>

165
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>He always had reports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always had interviews.</v>

166
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>He was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

167
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>he was probably one of the top three </v>
<v Speaker 1>riders in Alabama.</v>

168
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And I remember he was very productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would do.</v>

169
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>He was doing his version of Gonzo </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism for MMA,</v>

170
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>like asking MMA fighters if they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>anal sex.</v>

171
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I just like being real crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my shift.</v>

172
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So it turned out that this dude wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a black belt at all and um,</v>

173
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

174
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't half Brazilian.</v>

175
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

176
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.930
<v Speaker 1>it was all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were driving and Eddie had this </v>

177
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with them on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make a long story short,</v>

178
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>homeboy winds up killing some dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangling him to death.</v>

179
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>The husband of this chick that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging and he winds up going to jail </v>

180
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was,</v>

181
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.840
<v Speaker 1>he was a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

182
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got this guy insurance.</v>

183
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Medicaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

185
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wife of this guy that he strangled,</v>

186
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

187
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:57.331
<v Speaker 1>they decided to set this up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>choked the guy to death until the guy </v>

188
00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 1>with a real naked choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How ironic is it?</v>

189
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:03.791
<v Speaker 1>That is black belt wasn't legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he killed someone with a rear naked </v>

190
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Guy,</v>

191
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Speaker 1>poor guy killed in a trained at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably didn't even see it coming.</v>

192
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I just jumped up and choke the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>

193
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Can You Imagine Matt Madman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking wife as banging some other </v>

<v Speaker 1>on that trial.</v>

197
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you really had to go to court and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just finger,</v>

198
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they called me.</v>

199
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:34.391
<v Speaker 1>They called me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops called me because I called </v>

200
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:34.430

<v Speaker 1>Gerald on the phone,</v>

201
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the phone was being tapped and Gerald </v>

<v Speaker 1>And so Jerald was being tapped and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking all these different people </v>

207
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:50.860

<v Speaker 1>or even a too hot to handle.</v>

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 1>He said it just cleaned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speed did.</v>

232
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is it?</v>

233
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Why is it speed can help you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized?</v>

234
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does it give you fucking energy?</v>

235
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you could do anything?</v>

236
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 1>You just want to paint the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

237
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You want to go to college?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to fucking Louisiana.</v>

238
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad for you?</v>

239
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

240
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be it's gotTa be right.</v>

241
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>What comes up must come down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

242
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Anything that speeds you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be bad.</v>

243
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's like super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just super speeds you out.</v>

244
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>It makes me like really organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert told me once,</v>

245
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:21.171
<v Speaker 1>he took one accidentally and he said he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just started organizing all of his </v>

246
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:23.931
<v Speaker 1>notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that's what happens when you add </v>

247
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:25.750
<v Speaker 1>speed to think that you could use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though as a tool if you could really </v>

248
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>make sure you didn't do too much of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't fuck up your whole system and</v>

249
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:35.030
<v Speaker 1>short circuit everything like every now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you knew that the problem </v>

250
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>as you come down so hard that you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>more to come down from adderall.</v>

251
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about adderall but anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeding usually goes up.</v>

252
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Comes down hard on it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

253
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddies.</v>

254
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>He said he loves it and it helps them </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize.</v>

255
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Helps them work and he's pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitious.</v>

256
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hard worker,</v>

257
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:56.031
<v Speaker 1>but he said he was just really listless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't get anything going on and </v>

258
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got them on the adderall and </v>

259
00:10:59.571 --> 00:10:59.571
<v Speaker 1>then pam just couldn't focus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on things.</v>

260
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He just had a hard time committing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and concentrating.</v>

261
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it works different than speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because speed somehow I don't know how </v>

262
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.031
<v Speaker 1>it works really well by Athena speed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fuel of the capitalist </v>

263
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 1>society and I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the,</v>

264
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>we're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the people who drink coffee </v>

265
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

266
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.910
<v Speaker 1>in every union contract they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate a time where you could take a </v>

267
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking coffee break,</v>

268
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and union contracts have coffee break </v>

269
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the coffee break cover?</v>

270
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Break was your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking 11:00</v>

271
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite launched yet.</v>

272
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Coffee truck pulls up and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to take fucking five slash 10 </v>

273
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>minutes off and fuel up on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stimulants.</v>

274
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come back,</v>

<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You work harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel better,</v>

277
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like you got another little</v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

278
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

279
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>that's union things is one thing they </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out that was smart.</v>

280
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

281
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 1>everybody doesn't have to be a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people will like go against unions.</v>

282
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:53.181
<v Speaker 1>The unions fuck up business and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work hard and they make too much </v>

283
00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>money and blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make work easier and that's good.</v>

284
00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.110
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to have people work like </v>

285
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

286
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be better if they got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit less done?</v>

287
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 1>But everybody was more happy when that'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>

288
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>They get a nice coffee break and get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>relax for an hour for lunch where they </v>

289
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like they're getting tortured</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
