00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.123
<v Speaker 1>What's bad?</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Stevia,</v>

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 2>the Joe Rogan experience</v>

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 2>podcast by</v>

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 2>looking at a Tom Papa.</v>

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.323
<v Speaker 2>He wants over this.</v>

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what this is?</v>

8
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Is Bulletproof coffee bulletproof?</v>

9
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 2>The idea behind it is that.</v>

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.733
<v Speaker 2>Is there any in there?</v>

11
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I feel so cold.</v>

13
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

14
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

15
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

16
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

17
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's coffee that's blended with grass fed butter and MCT oil once.</v>

18
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.343
<v Speaker 1>It's actually.</v>

19
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.361
<v Speaker 1>It's a very conscious.</v>

20
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.194
<v Speaker 1>It looks milky.</v>

21
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

22
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>The guy who invented it was a guy named Rob Wolf,</v>

23
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>but the guy who popularized it as kind of a nutty dude that had a lot of false</v>

24
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>claims about the benefits of it.</v>

25
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>If you want some of this Stevia stuff,</v>

26
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>this is actually pretty,</v>

27
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.411
<v Speaker 1>pretty Yummy,</v>

28
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to use very little of it.</v>

29
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:53.474
<v Speaker 1>It's very sweet,</v>

30
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but it has no sugar in it.</v>

31
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural sweetener.</v>

32
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Is there milk in this?</v>

33
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.033
<v Speaker 1>It's butter.</v>

34
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Butter is butter.</v>

35
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Grass fed butter blended in with mct oil.</v>

36
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Mct Oil is a medium chain triglyceride.</v>

37
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Oil Oil.</v>

38
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.014
<v Speaker 1>It's the most,</v>

39
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the healthiest aspects of coconut oil.</v>

40
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>They're spun in a centrifuge and then it's extracted and then they take that and</v>

41
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>they blended in with the coffee.</v>

42
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.211
<v Speaker 1>This is why I love you,</v>

43
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

44
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

45
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.851
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

46
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>This is why this kind of stuff,</v>

47
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>whenever I listen to you,</v>

48
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but whenever I listened to you,</v>

49
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 2>you can know more about this kind of stuff you like.</v>

50
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 2>When I listened to you say stuff like that,</v>

51
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

52
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>what do I do with my time?</v>

53
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I need to read more.</v>

54
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So is this is black coffee?</v>

55
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.243
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

56
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>it was black,</v>

57
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but then it's blended in with this.</v>

58
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

59
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Medium tree.</v>

60
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.453
<v Speaker 1>It mean that.</v>

61
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.303
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's in that.</v>

62
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>They're all.</v>

63
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.541
<v Speaker 1>They're all bulletproof,</v>

64
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.374
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.663
<v Speaker 1>None of it's black.</v>

66
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>It tastes good like it.</v>

67
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 2>It's Yummy.</v>

68
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Coffee to coffee.</v>

69
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

70
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 2>When I go to sleep at night,</v>

71
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I get so excited like,</v>

72
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.503
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

73
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to close my eyes now and when I opened them,</v>

74
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be coffee time again.</v>

75
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.923
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

76
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.361
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>

77
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

78
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 2>You might want to look into that.</v>

79
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever take time off of coughing?</v>

80
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

81
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Not Interested in that.</v>

82
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

83
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

84
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

85
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fighting it like A.</v>

86
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.871
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

87
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe I shouldn't have it in the afternoon.</v>

88
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.363
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

89
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

90
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

91
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things,</v>

92
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.913
<v Speaker 1>false,</v>

93
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>false ideas that people have about the negative aspects of coughing.</v>

94
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not really that bad for you.</v>

95
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not right now.</v>

96
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a dehydrating element.</v>

97
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It has a diuretic effect,</v>

98
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but you just drink water,</v>

99
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>be right.</v>

100
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I need energy.</v>

101
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I need to get through all day and night,</v>

102
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is with some people that stresses their adrenals can drink too</v>

103
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.194
<v Speaker 1>much coffee.</v>

104
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like many things.</v>

105
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:46.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

107
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>You go overboard.</v>

108
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 1>If you have too much salt,</v>

110
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>that will fucking kill you.</v>

111
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:50.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

112
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:50.561
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

113
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>if you eat a pound of salt,</v>

114
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you're a dead man right now.</v>

115
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

116
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

117
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.101
<v Speaker 2>that's how I feel.</v>

118
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're grown ups now and there are things that are kind of vices and</v>

119
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 2>you have to them like drinking.</v>

120
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to drink like I did when I was 25.</v>

121
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I drink like a,</v>

122
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>like a grownup,</v>

123
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.903
<v Speaker 2>like a gentleman,</v>

124
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.691
<v Speaker 2>like a gentleman,</v>

125
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>5:00 comes,</v>

126
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Martini Shaker,</v>

127
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>one cocktail.</v>

128
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

129
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Who's getting hurt?</v>

130
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting hurt.</v>

131
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.751
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>

132
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:19.250
<v Speaker 1>they've shown that a glass of wine a day is actually as healthy as exercise for</v>

133
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:19.920
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

134
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.753
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

135
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Who were those?</v>

136
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 2>Some people.</v>

137
00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>How do you know if you want to something?</v>

138
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

139
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you probably most.</v>

140
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea behind a glass of wine is,</v>

141
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:28.561
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

142
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:29.940
<v Speaker 1>there's resveratrol in it,</v>

143
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.691
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

144
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

145
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>a natural antioxidant that comes from grapes and exists in wine and it's</v>

146
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>actually very good for her.</v>

147
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I actually take it as a supplement because Charles,</v>

148
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.053
<v Speaker 1>very good for you.</v>

149
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.381
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

150
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of that,</v>

151
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of benefit in a stress relieving the,</v>

152
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

153
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>the wind hits you and you're like,</v>

154
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

155
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And that calmness and strength,</v>

156
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.220
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to,</v>

157
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>under or over emphasize how important that is.</v>

158
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

159
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive,</v>

160
00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>

161
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Now I have a,</v>

162
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I do yoga and it's primarily because of that.</v>

163
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 2>When I'm not doing it,</v>

165
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 2>my stress level is so much higher.</v>

166
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not the stress levels.</v>

167
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Stress is always the same.</v>

168
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.240
<v Speaker 2>My life is my life,</v>

169
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but it just kind of rolls off when I'm really active with it.</v>

170
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of rolls off.</v>

171
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Manageable,</v>

172
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:21.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

173
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.681
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

175
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:23.514
<v Speaker 2>Smoke weed.</v>

176
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

177
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.073
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

178
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It is good for you.</v>

179
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.713
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of.</v>

180
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've cut back.</v>

181
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

182
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Well I know I'm coming back.</v>

183
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.841
<v Speaker 2>Coming back to weed.</v>

184
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.674
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I got some right here.</v>

186
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>If you want to find one of these bad boys.</v>

187
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

188
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to drive.</v>

189
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Scared to drive.</v>

190
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

191
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

192
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:42.384
<v Speaker 2>I am scared.</v>

194
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.041
<v Speaker 2>I am scared.</v>

195
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:44.874
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is.</v>

196
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's an older guy,</v>

197
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 2>comedian talking about me now.</v>

198
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.273
<v Speaker 2>You're young man.</v>

199
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

200
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 2>he's gay and that's definitely not me,</v>

201
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:55.740
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

202
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Came up.</v>

203
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>He came up during the,</v>

204
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 2>during the time when people weren't out right.</v>

205
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>And now everybody's out.</v>

206
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>But because he grew up during that time and he's pretty much out.</v>

207
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>He still like shaky.</v>

208
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.284
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't.</v>

209
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.131
<v Speaker 2>He's still scared.</v>

210
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Like he will speak in hushed tones about certain stuff because that's how we</v>

211
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 2>grew up.</v>

212
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel with weed I came up with was illegal and you're paranoid all</v>

213
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 2>the time and trying to sneak it.</v>

214
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm 46,</v>

215
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.700
<v Speaker 1>so you're a year younger than me.</v>

216
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.481
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

217
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm 47.</v>

219
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Are you really smoke it son?</v>

220
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't be scared or this is what I smoked up until I guess like maybe,</v>

221
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:36.211
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

222
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 2>five years after college,</v>

223
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 2>six years maybe something like a good 10 year block of all the time.</v>

224
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.573
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

225
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

226
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't as funny.</v>

227
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.423
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't as,</v>

228
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I really wasn't,</v>

229
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

230
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.410
<v Speaker 2>it was taking away my funny and uh,</v>

231
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 2>so I put it down and stayed away for a pretty long time and uh,</v>

232
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been a comedian for 20 years,</v>

233
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>so like 10 years of it I was doing it and then last 10 and I haven't been doing</v>

234
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.870
<v Speaker 2>it and uh,</v>

235
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 2>just in the last year or two,</v>

236
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

237
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm bringing it back in.</v>

238
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Just been the last year or two.</v>

239
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

240
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.680
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

241
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.513
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

242
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.050
<v Speaker 3>was it a pragmatic decision,</v>

243
00:06:13.051 --> 00:06:14.220
<v Speaker 3>like a funny decision?</v>

244
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

245
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

246
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

247
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.601
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

248
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:17.620
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty thought.</v>

249
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.031
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty thoughtful.</v>

251
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:19.864
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

252
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I stopped because there was this kid that I used to in high school I used to</v>

253
00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 2>riff with all the time we would get together.</v>

254
00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:27.480
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>

255
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.920
<v Speaker 2>was just an Irish naturally funny,</v>

256
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:31.750
<v Speaker 2>like naturally Irish,</v>

258
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>those guys that could just curse,</v>

259
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Speaker 2>like nobody could and just hilarious and the two of us would always get together</v>

260
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>at these parties and we would just screw around and everyone would be laughing</v>

261
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

262
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.460
<v Speaker 2>we're riffing together and it was great.</v>

263
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And so I went away and came back one time in college and it was high and we met</v>

264
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>up at a party and he just ran circles around me.</v>

265
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I completely didn't have it.</v>

266
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

267
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Duh,</v>

268
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.150
<v Speaker 2>because you're too.</v>

269
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I was too high.</v>

270
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.363
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

271
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I always thought about that.</v>

272
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 2>And then as I was going along it was like,</v>

273
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:04.020
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as productive.</v>

274
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't as funny.</v>

275
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:05.944
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't,</v>

276
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 2>wasn't working for me.</v>

277
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So I just completely put it down and then,</v>

278
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 2>worked on my comedy and did everything that I wanted to do as a comedian.</v>

280
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And now the same thing as the alcohol,</v>

281
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.053
<v Speaker 2>like a gentleman,</v>

282
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I know how to smoke,</v>

283
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:20.020
<v Speaker 2>now I know how to drink the,</v>

284
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.973
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

285
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of bring it back and especially I really use it,</v>

286
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm writing when.</v>

287
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

288
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I always at least have a notebook around me.</v>

289
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

290
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 2>don't like to smoke socially.</v>

291
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

292
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.793
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

293
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you get weird.</v>

294
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

295
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.561
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

296
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I get a little weird right now.</v>

297
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.043
<v Speaker 3>I'm always weird.</v>

298
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.633
<v Speaker 3>I always feel weird.</v>

299
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I always had a great quote they asked her about.</v>

300
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>She's gone to Coachella and the asked her a,</v>

301
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 2>are you going to get high or whatever.</v>

302
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.781
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

303
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:54.531
<v Speaker 2>do you know I do this.</v>

304
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I do that.</v>

305
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:55.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

306
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.140
<v Speaker 2>you get high there.</v>

307
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

308
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.321
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

309
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:57.621
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

310
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.454
<v Speaker 2>I have a rule.</v>

311
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I never get high.</v>

312
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 2>If I have to pretend that I'm not.</v>

313
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.053
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that great?</v>

314
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.760
<v Speaker 3>That really hit home for me.</v>

315
00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:06.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

316
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.313
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>

317
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be like,</v>

318
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.001
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

319
00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:09.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

320
00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

321
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

322
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:10.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>You should never lie about being high.</v>

324
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

325
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

326
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like people lie about three things on a regular basis.</v>

327
00:08:16.741 --> 00:08:17.820
<v Speaker 3>They lie about being high.</v>

328
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 3>They lie about whether or not they were awake when you called them and they lie.</v>

329
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not they forwarded three things that are super common that people lie</v>

330
00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:26.280
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

331
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I was just with a friend of mine.</v>

332
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

333
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.333
<v Speaker 3>I'll say his name,</v>

334
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Danny,</v>

335
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>the guy who runs largo and uh,</v>

336
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Speaker 3>we were just having coffee this morning and we're the only two people outside</v>

337
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.300
<v Speaker 3>any foreign fucker.</v>

338
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

339
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 3>like a big cabbage fart</v>

340
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 3>planning.</v>

341
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.993
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

342
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.833
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it.</v>

343
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes you did.</v>

344
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes you did.</v>

345
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Was even if it was mine and it snuck out and I wasn't aware.</v>

346
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 3>My never smell like big Scottish and Irish.</v>

347
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 3>He completely lied right to face.</v>

348
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>And then when we were</v>

349
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 4>saying goodbye at the,</v>

350
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

351
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

352
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.763
<v Speaker 4>parking meters,</v>

353
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.410
<v Speaker 4>the smell came up again and I just let it go and when he's not going to come to</v>

354
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.493
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

355
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 4>some people would just fart all over.</v>

356
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 4>You smoked the whole time.</v>

357
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:08.510
<v Speaker 4>Did you smoke all the way through?</v>

358
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.770
<v Speaker 4>Did you pick up weed later on?</v>

359
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 4>I picked up when I was 30.</v>

360
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.293
<v Speaker 4>When you were 30.</v>

361
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 4>So last 17 years.</v>

362
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:14.701
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

363
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 4>that's healthy because your brain was already.</v>

364
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 4>You were already Joe Rogan.</v>

365
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 4>I had a bad idea of it though.</v>

366
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 4>My idea of weed was a weed was bad for you.</v>

367
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 4>My idea was that we'd was just,</v>

368
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:24.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

369
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

370
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

371
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 4>it was a crutch and it was for weak minded people.</v>

372
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

373
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.573
<v Speaker 4>I had this,</v>

374
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot of misconceptions about pot.</v>

375
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

376
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.313
<v Speaker 4>I picked it up.</v>

377
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 4>I guess I want to see what year was it?</v>

378
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.963
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

379
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.561
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

380
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:40.741
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

381
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:43.000
<v Speaker 4>it was somewhere around 2000.</v>

382
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 4>What was your first time?</v>

383
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Was it a big deal?</v>

384
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.513
<v Speaker 4>It was your first time.</v>

385
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

386
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 4>you have this probably before 2000 now let's think about it because it was</v>

387
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 4>before y two k because I was high when y twoK was happening,</v>

388
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 4>was terrified.</v>

389
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 4>It's all going down really happening.</v>

390
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.801
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

391
00:09:58.801 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 4>my ideas were about,</v>

392
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 4>were all wrong and they are all based on people being losers.</v>

393
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

394
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 4>There's also based on just the idea of drugs themselves,</v>

395
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 4>I had grown up around quite a few people that had drug problems and especially</v>

396
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.574
<v Speaker 4>with coke,</v>

397
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 4>which I'd never have done.</v>

398
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

399
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 4>And it's because of that.</v>

400
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 4>It's because of seeing these people like their lives,</v>

401
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 4>like get devastated by this drug.</v>

402
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 4>So I was a,</v>

403
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I was terrified of it all.</v>

404
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Drugs I felt like made you a loser.</v>

405
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

406
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not.</v>

407
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

408
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're around it and you see it,</v>

409
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think that,</v>

410
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

411
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 4>it was so much loser thing and I don't at this point,</v>

412
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I do think you can start too early.</v>

413
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 4>I do think as a parent,</v>

414
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying this in case my children's friends listened to the show and then tell</v>

415
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:46.794
<v Speaker 4>my daughter.</v>

416
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.643
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

417
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 4>but I do think like at a certain,</v>

418
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 4>like if you can start to early,</v>

419
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 4>everyone I know who started too early got a little weird if you spun out a</v>

420
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

421
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 4>but your brain has to kind of become you.</v>

422
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 4>You're so just to figure out who you are and what,</v>

423
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

424
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 4>your brain is really hyper developing then like why mess with it?</v>

425
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

426
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 4>I think you're taking like a real big,</v>

427
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 4>like you take a big leap from your normal consciousness when you're getting high</v>

428
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 4>and we just sort of getting the feel of your normal consciousness.</v>

429
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 4>If you're getting high all the time,</v>

430
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 4>it can miss out on a developmental period.</v>

431
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Completely,</v>

432
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 4>very confusing period.</v>

433
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:26.050
<v Speaker 4>And Lynn,</v>

434
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 4>why throw that into it?</v>

435
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

436
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:28.471
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

437
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 4>I completely agree.</v>

438
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's certain amount of people especially that should never try</v>

439
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.923
<v Speaker 4>weed.</v>

440
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not for them.</v>

441
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

442
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Did you feel like by the time you were 30 when you started,</v>

443
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 4>like you kind of were done with all of figuring out who you were kind of</v>

444
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.350
<v Speaker 4>weirdness or were you,</v>

445
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

446
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 4>no real figuring out who I am?</v>

447
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I think will.</v>

448
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.953
<v Speaker 4>You're always.</v>

449
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I think if you really are not growing as a person,</v>

450
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

451
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 4>you're basically dead in the water,</v>

452
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

453
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's A.</v>

454
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm not perfect.</v>

455
00:11:59.291 --> 00:11:59.981
<v Speaker 4>No one's perfect.</v>

456
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 4>So if you're not perfect,</v>

457
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly trying to improve on various aspects of your life.</v>

458
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.201
<v Speaker 4>And as a comic,</v>

459
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:08.210
<v Speaker 4>especially when you abandoned your material,</v>

460
00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 4>like you have an act,</v>

461
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 4>you put out a special and then you toss all your material out,</v>

462
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 4>you're starting fresh.</v>

463
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 4>You kinda got to reinvent like what your thoughts are reinventing you.</v>

464
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 4>Definitely reinventing what you're presenting on stage.</v>

465
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

466
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.990
<v Speaker 4>So there's this constant sort of cycle or developmental period where you go</v>

467
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:30.394
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

468
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

469
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 4>you put out the Special Yuh,</v>

470
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Yuh Yuh,</v>

471
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.963
<v Speaker 4>Yuh Yuh.</v>

472
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.160
<v Speaker 4>It too is,</v>

473
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 4>is fine an edge as you think that you can and then you release it and then you</v>

474
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:39.821
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

475
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

476
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 4>let's start all over again.</v>

477
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 4>When you're starting all over again.</v>

478
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of thinking involved.</v>

479
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 4>That's why those old guys that never wrote.</v>

480
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

481
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.200
<v Speaker 4>there was a period like,</v>

482
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

483
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 4>we've all seen those guys that have the same act from 20 years ago.</v>

484
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>

485
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Those poor bastards,</v>

486
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 4>they become irrelevant.</v>

487
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.821
<v Speaker 4>They really quick.</v>

488
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

489
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.043
<v Speaker 4>they die,</v>

490
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.460
<v Speaker 4>die in their mind.</v>

491
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Their mind is dead.</v>

492
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Dead.</v>

493
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Like you see them on stage telling those old jokes,</v>

494
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:05.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

495
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 4>like fucking Christ man.</v>

496
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

497
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy that came into the improv not too long ago.</v>

498
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 4>It was doing Oj jokes if,</v>

499
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 4>unless it's a really good Oj joke.</v>

500
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:14.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

501
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:15.244
<v Speaker 4>you never know.</v>

502
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.610
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like that.</v>

503
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 4>A guy has a new take on an old story.</v>

504
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

505
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 4>that old yarn.</v>

506
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.113
<v Speaker 4>But it was like.</v>

507
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 4>So you guys heard about Oj,</v>

508
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.973
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

509
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 4>You think he was guilty.</v>

510
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.580
<v Speaker 4>But we're so self aware as Comedians,</v>

511
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 4>you're always looking at yourself,</v>

512
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 4>analyzing yourself,</v>

513
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.151
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

514
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

515
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.830
<v Speaker 4>we're kind of hyper aware.</v>

516
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.470
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

517
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.303
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to.</v>

518
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you can bomb.</v>

519
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 4>You ever have like a big thing happen in your life and you go back on stage and</v>

520
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:43.270
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

521
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.541
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

522
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm a different guy than the guy that wrote this stuff.</v>

523
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely.</v>

524
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

525
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the beautiful thing about getting rid of your act every couple of</v>

526
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 4>years or at least doing a new specialist starting from scratch every couple of</v>

527
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

528
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 4>So you can kind of represent who you are right now.</v>

529
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

530
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

531
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll go back and listen to like my first CD from 1999 Christ.</v>

532
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

533
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Any leads that was like a CD on warner brothers,</v>

534
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 4>like a real cd.</v>

535
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 4>Like I can go back and listen to recordings before that.</v>

536
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Fucking God awful.</v>

537
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 4>You had to go back and do your own act from your first couple of years.</v>

538
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.223
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

539
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 4>What's amazing to me,</v>

540
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 4>and I always think about is people were hiring me when I was telling me stokes</v>

541
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 4>and like I was making money with this act.</v>

542
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 4>It was so bad.</v>

543
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:27.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

544
00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 4>if you went to any comedy club across the country,</v>

545
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:33.740
<v Speaker 4>you see various stages of development and you're always gonna.</v>

546
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.593
<v Speaker 4>See that?</v>

547
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 4>I remember really clearly like struggling and trying to put it together and then</v>

548
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:40.990
<v Speaker 4>go into see someone really good and be like,</v>

549
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

550
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Never getting there.</v>

551
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

552
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.130
<v Speaker 4>This is never happening.</v>

553
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 4>I know it makes you almost want to quit.</v>

554
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.600
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

555
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.940
<v Speaker 4>you know it has been doing that to me lately as a Maria Bamford.</v>

556
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I watched her ran into her a couple times and she was just so prolific in</v>

557
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>writing so much in such good stuff and I was just like,</v>

558
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.351
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

559
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like you go,</v>

560
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

561
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 2>let me look at my material.</v>

562
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Hm,</v>

563
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 2>what am I cheating on?</v>

564
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Getting labs with this whole act,</v>

565
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 2>but what am I really?</v>

566
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.270
<v Speaker 2>What am,</v>

567
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>what am I mugging?</v>

568
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.920
<v Speaker 2>What am I,</v>

569
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 2>where is there not really a solid idea or solid joke and you start looking at</v>

570
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>

571
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

572
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

573
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm cheating here.</v>

574
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a good line here is.</v>

575
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they're laughing at this.</v>

576
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was my funny face when I say it,</v>

577
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like to really kind of look at it and analyze it.</v>

578
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is kind of cheating 80 percent of the time.</v>

579
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.823
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why like,</v>

580
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

581
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.350
<v Speaker 4>being inspired by your peers.</v>

582
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.190
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the good things about being in a big comedy community like New York</v>

583
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.150
<v Speaker 4>or is it you get to be around like all these high level comics on a regular</v>

584
00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:54.360
<v Speaker 4>basis and you sorta can compare yourself to them completely.</v>

585
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 2>This is why I'm psyched to be here and I really am very happy to be here because</v>

586
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I've been a fan of yours for a long,</v>

587
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 2>long time and we never really never really hung out.</v>

588
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 2>We never really is.</v>

589
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a big sea of comedy.</v>

590
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 2>If we could both be in it for that long and not really</v>

591
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.443
<v Speaker 4>see each other,</v>

592
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.523
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

593
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.910
<v Speaker 4>That's a big pool.</v>

594
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.091
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

595
00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:16.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of places to go.</v>

596
00:16:16.201 --> 00:16:17.034
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

597
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.140
<v Speaker 4>how many we've been having this discussion lately.</v>

598
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.180
<v Speaker 4>How many comics do you think there are in this country?</v>

599
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Like working professional comedians who actually,</v>

600
00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:25.464
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>

601
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.100
<v Speaker 4>It's their only gig or if they're only Gig,</v>

602
00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:30.780
<v Speaker 4>they're like real headliners,</v>

603
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.340
<v Speaker 4>like the tomato of a TV show or something like that,</v>

604
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:33.174
<v Speaker 4>but there are legit,</v>

605
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

606
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:35.004
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

607
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 4>a middle act and make their living.</v>

608
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.760
<v Speaker 4>They can make their living off comedy.</v>

609
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

610
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say a real pro,</v>

611
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 2>a real pro thousand.</v>

612
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go a little higher.</v>

613
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.703
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

614
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

615
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Good for you.</v>

616
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of gigs at.</v>

617
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm really bad at math,</v>

618
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.090
<v Speaker 4>but then wait a minute.</v>

619
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.820
<v Speaker 4>How many as a thousand fingers out?</v>

620
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

621
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:00.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

622
00:17:00.571 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Speaker 2>because I mean think about every single night there's,</v>

623
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.960
<v Speaker 2>there's gigs happening everywhere.</v>

624
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Every stupid town.</v>

625
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.460
<v Speaker 2>There's some bar,</v>

626
00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:12.690
<v Speaker 2>some corporate gigs,</v>

627
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:14.100
<v Speaker 2>some theater show,</v>

628
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.510
<v Speaker 2>some something going on.</v>

629
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:16.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

630
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of those I wouldn't even think are real comics.</v>

631
00:17:19.261 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 4>They're just like the best that that city has.</v>

632
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

633
00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:24.750
<v Speaker 4>they're not really like touring like that same time.</v>

634
00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:27.240
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not going to like Indiana next week.</v>

635
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:28.074
<v Speaker 4>And then like,</v>

636
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

637
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.520
<v Speaker 4>Florida that does have.</v>

638
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:31.980
<v Speaker 4>But they are pro comics.</v>

639
00:17:31.981 --> 00:17:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Like there's like you've always talk about Boston having all those local</v>

640
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:37.470
<v Speaker 4>professional communities that never left,</v>

641
00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:37.711
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

642
00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:39.330
<v Speaker 4>were undeniably pros.</v>

643
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

644
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I guess I don't think it's maybe a thousand.</v>

645
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.523
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot.</v>

646
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.230
<v Speaker 4>Silat thousands of</v>

647
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.571
<v Speaker 2>out of that thousand.</v>

648
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:46.751
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

649
00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's call it a thousand.</v>

650
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Out of that thousand,</v>

651
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>how many are good?</v>

652
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 4>200.</v>

653
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.030
<v Speaker 4>200 are good.</v>

654
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.143
<v Speaker 4>200.</v>

655
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

656
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

657
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's about right.</v>

658
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

659
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.790
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

660
00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:17:58.031 --> 00:17:58.864
<v Speaker 4>you've got to add,</v>

662
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

663
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

664
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.020
<v Speaker 4>there's a variability based on taste and subjective thinking.</v>

665
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.863
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

666
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.621
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

667
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 4>you know when someone's good.</v>

668
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

669
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

670
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:07.501
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>

671

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

672
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 4>what I might think is good.</v>

673
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.120
<v Speaker 4>I might have a higher standard and some,</v>

674
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 4>some I've been,</v>

675
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 4>have had people tell me,</v>

676
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.190

677
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:14.851

692
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to listen to it.</v>

693
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 4>it's called cheap laughs.</v>

700
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Built on fake energy.</v>

701
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

705
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 4>there's something to be learned.</v>

706
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.284
<v Speaker 4>Even from that.</v>

707
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's one of the things that I always used to say about Carlos when ceos</v>

708
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 4>that I never understood why people were laughing,</v>

709
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.014
<v Speaker 4>but it was amazing.</v>

710
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 4>The energy that he put out,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you get the.</v>

712

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 4>like roads,</v>

716
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.310
<v Speaker 4>But there they were all caught up in this energy and momentum of the blah blah,</v>

717
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.401
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 4>fake thing where they don't really give a fuck about what they're talking about</v>

727
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.124
<v Speaker 4>new.</v>

728
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.130
<v Speaker 4>But they're kind of.</v>

729
00:19:21.131 --> 00:19:22.950
<v Speaker 4>It's closer to politicians.</v>

730
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 4>And they are comedians.</v>

731

<v Speaker 4>They know how to turn it on the crowd.</v>

733
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 4>They know how to work it.</v>

734
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 4>But there's a clause for the ladies.</v>

735
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Ladies are working hard out there.</v>

736
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:33.421

741
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.510

744
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 4>They'll say things where you go,</v>

745
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.001

<v Speaker 4>the worst is though when you're.</v>

752
00:19:57.871 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're in showcase clubs,</v>

753
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 4>you're wondering like eight guys that night and it's like,</v>

754
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:02.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.110
<v Speaker 4>they're telling me I gotta go.</v>

756
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.191
<v Speaker 4>I gotta go,</v>

757
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Speaker 4>guys are giving me the lag.</v>

758
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

759
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 4>please stay there telling me I gotta go up there.</v>

760
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Really politicians,</v>

761
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.941
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that.</v>

762
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

763
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.413
<v Speaker 4>It kind of slick.</v>

764
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.210
<v Speaker 4>But you kinda gotta be a little bit,</v>

765
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:18.451
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

766
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 4>You've got to kind of get people to like you a little,</v>

767
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 4>especially if you want to push forth and he really controversial idea.</v>

768
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 4>You're going to kind of sneaking in on them somehow.</v>

769
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

770
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Like what we were talking about earlier,</v>

771
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.273
<v Speaker 4>wound full of sugar.</v>

772
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Well we were talking about earlier where you were saying that because it's so</v>

773
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:36.420
<v Speaker 4>easy to criticize comedians these days,</v>

774
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 4>so many people go after people for controversial jokes.</v>

775
00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about how these young guys you're seeing onstage,</v>

776
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 4>young gals as well are saying jokes,</v>

777
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 4>but there's still like before say it,</v>

778
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 4>they had</v>

779
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.281
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

780
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:48.491
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

781
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.130
<v Speaker 1>you know I am not racist.</v>

782
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

784
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I watched.</v>

785
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I watched five guys in front of me at the Improv in la go up and these are all</v>

786
00:20:58.211 --> 00:20:59.830
<v Speaker 2>young guys and they're all coming up.</v>

787
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't really have much credit,</v>

788
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:02.074
<v Speaker 2>but they're working.</v>

789
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 2>They've got spot at the Improv and every anything that came up with,</v>

790
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 2>if it was about race or religion or gender,</v>

791
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 2>they would apologize before the joke.</v>

792
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

793
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

794
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten to this level.</v>

795
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's now scared.</v>

796
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.000
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna,</v>

797
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna be Improv.</v>

798
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 2>There's probably 50 people in the audience tops.</v>

799
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

800
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.191
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

801
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing you should have if you're not free now,</v>

802
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.211
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

803
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

804
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.231
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

805
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:30.390
<v Speaker 2>All it takes is one blogger,</v>

806
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.233
<v Speaker 2>tom.</v>

807
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

808
00:21:32.151 --> 00:21:36.320
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing at the comedy store that they do every Tuesday night called</v>

809
00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:37.041
<v Speaker 1>the roast battle.</v>

810
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen it?</v>

811
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

812
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about it.</v>

813
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.643
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

814
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

815
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Really Fun because they do it in the belly room,</v>

816
00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:43.250
<v Speaker 1>which is this tiny little room.</v>

817
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:46.190
<v Speaker 1>They pack it with people and it's an insult competition,</v>

818
00:21:46.191 --> 00:21:50.540
<v Speaker 1>so right joke writing competition between two comics and the insult each other</v>

819
00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and the the audience and the judges sort of get to decide who,</v>

820
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the better stuff and they go hard at each other.</v>

821
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.180
<v Speaker 1>They fucking go hard,</v>

822
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 1>but somebody wrote an article because a,</v>

823
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:07.310
<v Speaker 1>someone white dropped an end bomb during during the show and they're like,</v>

824
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:07.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 1>are white people getting the n word pass at the comedy store and they wrote this</v>

826
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

827
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.450
<v Speaker 1>like you fucking piece of shit.</v>

828
00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you know what they're doing exactly what they're doing.</v>

829
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.110
<v Speaker 1>They weren't.</v>

830
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.531
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

831
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they weren't calling someone who was saying like,</v>

832
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.370
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a nigger,</v>

833
00:22:22.371 --> 00:22:22.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:23.570
<v Speaker 1>they weren't doing that.</v>

835
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.590
<v Speaker 1>They were using the word in the context of some sort of a joke and even if.</v>

836
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

837
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

838
00:22:28.401 --> 00:22:33.401
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like the idea that it can't be done like this is fuck you right</v>

839
00:22:33.411 --> 00:22:35.030
<v Speaker 1>now this it's comedy.</v>

840
00:22:35.031 --> 00:22:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Like there are things that are said in comedy.</v>

841
00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:37.731
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

842
00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:37.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

843
00:22:37.911 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>in real life,</v>

844
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.950
<v Speaker 1>in real speech,</v>

845
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.420
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to people,</v>

846
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.520
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not the best thing to say.</v>

847
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a rude thing to say,</v>

848
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.301
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

849
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:48.970
<v Speaker 2>but as a comedian in a club doing what you're doing,</v>

850
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>the only way it's gonna go away is if you don't fight it,</v>

851
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 2>if you don't resist it,</v>

852
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.833
<v Speaker 2>which is difficult,</v>

853
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 2>but if they come at you and say,</v>

854
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

855
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you're racist for saying this,</v>

856
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

857
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 2>The only comment is I'm a comedian,</v>

858
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and then that's it.</v>

859
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.993
<v Speaker 2>End of story.</v>

860
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>It's when you fight back and you give them,</v>

861
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you take the bait and it become.</v>

862
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>If it fuels it and that's what's been happening,</v>

863
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 2>so now people think,</v>

864
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:11.651
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

865
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I can get this famous guy to Apollo to apologize,</v>

866
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.850
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make news and be a part of it.</v>

867
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Not really fight back,</v>

868
00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but really like sort of defend it.</v>

869
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

870
00:23:21.681 --> 00:23:22.650
<v Speaker 1>not even defend it.</v>

871
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Apollo fighting back is important I think,</v>

872
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.890
<v Speaker 1>or at least stating your,</v>

873
00:23:27.891 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

874
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 1>your mind speaking your opinion,</v>

875
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but this idea of apologizing for jokes,</v>

876
00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:33.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck off</v>

877
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.561
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

878
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 2>the people who write about it,</v>

879
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.550
<v Speaker 2>who are in the audience and taking a fence in writing that they,</v>

880
00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:42.810
<v Speaker 2>to me are much more offensive than a comedian.</v>

881
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.853
<v Speaker 2>The comedian is.</v>

882
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.743
<v Speaker 2>He says this man,</v>

883
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>his is to make a joke.</v>

884
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 2>That's his job is to make light of things.</v>

885
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And if you're in the audience and you're calling someone a racist or you're</v>

886
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:54.951
<v Speaker 2>calling someone,</v>

887
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>massage dentist or whatever label,</v>

888
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.020
<v Speaker 2>you are much more violent than the clown up on stage.</v>

889
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Much more violent,</v>

890
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:04.080
<v Speaker 2>more violent,</v>

891
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 2>and more about your,</v>

892
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you're provoking.</v>

893
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You're much more offensive,</v>

894
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>much more offensive.</v>

895
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.171
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

896
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

897
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>and violence is close to the term because I did a show for our good friend.</v>

898
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

899
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Greg Fitzsimmons was like a fundraiser thing for the school thing and I was</v>

900
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

901
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I have this joke in my act where I say I live in La,</v>

902
00:24:22.331 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

903
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible school district that we're,</v>

904
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 2>that we live in and either had to pay for school or pay for guns and Ammo and my</v>

905
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 2>kids have no skills.</v>

906
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.430
<v Speaker 2>So I pay for school and the only rule I have school if I'm going to pay for</v>

907
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:38.620
<v Speaker 2>school is a,</v>

908
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it cannot be predominantly Asian.</v>

909
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.283
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

910
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Why would I pay all that money for my kids to be last in everything.</v>

911
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 2>And then I talk about these families,</v>

912
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 2>how they're just superior.</v>

913
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Asian families are superior.</v>

914
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:53.361
<v Speaker 2>They work harder.</v>

915
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:54.171
<v Speaker 2>They want their kids to,</v>

916
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 2>when they play five different instruments.</v>

917
00:24:55.671 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>My kids play the toilet paper roll on and on and this woman yells out from the</v>

918
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:00.674
<v Speaker 2>crowd,</v>

919
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 2>get some new material in the middle of it.</v>

920
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else is laughing.</v>

921
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Get some new material as.</v>

922
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:08.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

923
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

924
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.531
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

925
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 2>it's racist.</v>

926
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You're a racist,</v>

927
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I've never been called a racist in my life,</v>

928
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.313
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>

929
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:15.921
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

930
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:20.420
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of like being punched in the face and I said,</v>

931
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.313
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

932
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.410
<v Speaker 2>are you not listening to the guy next door?</v>

933
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:23.601
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

934
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 2>we're wondering where you're going with this.</v>

935
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 2>The Guy Friend,</v>

936
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.853
<v Speaker 2>he's with her,</v>

937
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 2>he must be with her.</v>

938
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.100
<v Speaker 2>So I'm leaning on the side,</v>

939
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.210
<v Speaker 2>just stop and lean on the stool.</v>

940
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.163
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

941
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 2>where am I going with this?</v>

942
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm pointing out that a Asian families,</v>

943
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

944
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 2>work harder than a traditional American white families.</v>

945
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 2>They work harder and hold their kids to a higher standard and the therefore</v>

946
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 2>they're excelling more in sports and they're excelling more in schools because</v>

947
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:55.860
<v Speaker 2>of how they're raising their,</v>

948
00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 2>held to these high standards and that they are actually doing better for their</v>

949
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>families and we are giving our kids a free pass and making sure that they have a</v>

950
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 2>good time.</v>

951
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.870
<v Speaker 2>But of course this all would have been done through jokes and would have been</v>

952
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>much more enjoyable experience for the rest of the audience if you had shut up.</v>

953
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

954
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

955
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:15.231
<v Speaker 2>what part?</v>

956
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Just so I understand</v>

957
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.270
<v Speaker 2>what race are you?</v>

958
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 2>What part did you,</v>

959
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 2>are you white?</v>

960
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Are You Asian?</v>

961
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.921
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

962
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mexican.</v>

963
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

964
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

965
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I can't help you.</v>

966
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong,</v>

967
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.340
<v Speaker 2>and everybody applauded.</v>

968
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the place applauded,</v>

969
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 2>but I mean her calling me a racist.</v>

970
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

971
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:37.551
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

972
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:38.384
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

973
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I went up and did a Neil Brennan show after that in Santa Monica and then drove</v>

974
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>home to my</v>

975
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 3>place in the valley after that and I was buzzing the whole time,</v>

976
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.310
<v Speaker 3>like by the time I got in,</v>

977
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>like I was angry,</v>

978
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 3>angry and the end and kind of hurt.</v>

979
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 3>But you went into a moron.</v>

980
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.381
<v Speaker 3>I ran into a mormon,</v>

981
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 3>but just that term of having someone say racist,</v>

982
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:57.981
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

983
00:26:57.981 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people</v>

984
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.010
<v Speaker 1>recreationally offended.</v>

985
00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:02.260
<v Speaker 1>They're looking to be offended whether it makes sense or not,</v>

986
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

987
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying black guys have bigger dicks,</v>

988
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.380
<v Speaker 3>racist writing,</v>

989
00:27:06.381 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 3>so that was a racist to be awesome.</v>

990
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.211
<v Speaker 3>How's it racist?</v>

991
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.890
<v Speaker 3>To be better as a racist,</v>

992
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 3>to be better at math.</v>

993
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 3>You say the Asians are better at school because it's racist.</v>

994
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.790
<v Speaker 3>It's racist to mock their eyes or say they were inferior race that's racist,</v>

995
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 3>racist to compliment a race exactly opposite of racist,</v>

996
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 3>sort of racist against your own kids there.</v>

997
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 3>So there was so much fun in a time when you could just talk about each other and</v>

998
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it.</v>

999
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Like really be like he'd be like,</v>

1000
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.080
<v Speaker 3>we were Italian and my friends were Irish and everybody had their things and</v>

1001
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.350
<v Speaker 3>you're celebrating.</v>

1002
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 3>You're celebrating that stuff.</v>

1003
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 3>My parents generation really celebrated it,</v>

1004
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1005
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.080
<v Speaker 3>now you can't even say what they are without it being perceived as awful.</v>

1006
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I had this Mexican lady yelled at me once.</v>

1007
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I had this joke about,</v>

1008
00:27:56.061 --> 00:27:56.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1009
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1010
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1011
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1012
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the Ufo that supposedly crashed and Roswell,</v>

1013
00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.420
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico in 1947.</v>

1014
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.170
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

1015
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the cover of the Roswell Times or whatever the newspaper was.</v>

1016
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I actually have it framed in my house that the cover of this newspaper,</v>

1017
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it said there was a headline that was like flying disc recovered like that.</v>

1018
00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:16.910
<v Speaker 1>They have flying saucer mean.</v>

1019
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 1>They wrote about it in the paper.</v>

1020
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.380

1073
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.890
<v Speaker 3>They should have made you fill out a form before you walked through the door.</v>

1077
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.370
<v Speaker 3>it was a series of people getting on stage and talking shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do Mexicans have a history?</v>

1088
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.810
<v Speaker 4>A long history of the pin.</v>

00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 4>they can legitimately find a reason to attack and they might not.</v>

1167
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.190
<v Speaker 4>If they weren't bloggers,</v>

1168
00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:00.930
<v Speaker 4>they might not have even focused on it,</v>

1169
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.910
<v Speaker 4>but because of the fact that it's a subject,</v>

1170
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:03.744
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1171
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.570
<v Speaker 4>do I really give a fuck about Kim Kardashian?</v>

1172
00:32:05.571 --> 00:32:06.241
<v Speaker 4>And no,</v>

1173
00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:07.074
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>

1174
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.130
<v Speaker 4>I really don't care.</v>

1175
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.400
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm looking for a joke and she does something stupid,</v>

1176
00:32:11.401 --> 00:32:11.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1177
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.001
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1178
00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:12.834
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

1179
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 4>sit down in front of the computer and I concoct a bit.</v>

1180
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1181
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.210
<v Speaker 4>this is life,</v>

1182
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:19.480
<v Speaker 4>this culture,</v>

1183
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 4>that's this.</v>

1184
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:20.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1185
00:32:20.731 --> 00:32:23.370
<v Speaker 4>you can't fault them in some ways because it is what they do,</v>

1186
00:32:23.371 --> 00:32:26.910
<v Speaker 4>but there's a really asinine viewpoint when you're,</v>

1187
00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:27.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1188
00:32:27.121 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1189
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.780
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at jokes and you're trying to pretend that this person is in</v>

1190
00:32:30.781 --> 00:32:34.350
<v Speaker 4>court giving an affidavit and these are their actual thoughts on these subjects.</v>

1191
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.543
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1192
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:36.541
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be.</v>

1193
00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:37.380
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's,</v>

1194
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the,</v>

1195
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 4>just the responsibility of the comedians at the end of the day.</v>

1196
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 4>You've just got to stick to it.</v>

1197
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1198
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 4>do you remember when patrice o neal,</v>

1199
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 4>he was on this thing.</v>

1200
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 4>It was a Fox News show and it was back when opie and Anthony got fired.</v>

1201
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 4>They got suspended I guess,</v>

1202
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 4>and he said he was a really important point.</v>

1203
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:59.981
<v Speaker 4>You said jokes that you are offended by and jokes that you love all come from</v>

1204
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 4>the same place.</v>

1205
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.720
<v Speaker 4>Someone's just trying to be funny,</v>

1206
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 4>like you don't understand that because you don't understand funny,</v>

1207
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1208
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.110
<v Speaker 4>They're just trying to make you laugh and some,</v>

1209
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 4>some of them hit and some of them met and that's just the way it goes.</v>

1210
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's the scary part is that you're in a club trying to make it hit and as</v>

1211
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you're working out material you'll say stuff just working.</v>

1212
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take six months before this joke is even ready and people are</v>

1213
00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 4>taping you two weeks in when it's ugly and you don't really know what you're</v>

1214
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1215
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 4>Blurting stuff out.</v>

1216
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 4>That's dangerous.</v>

1217
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1218
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:33.110
<v Speaker 4>you know Chris Rock has that world famous joke,</v>

1219
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 4>one of his best jokes ever that I love black people,</v>

1220
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:36.734
<v Speaker 4>but I hate niggers.</v>

1221
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.930
<v Speaker 4>It was a bit.</v>

1222
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Well apparently Louis told me that that bit took a year to work.</v>

1223
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.041
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1224
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:44.450
<v Speaker 4>He used to bomb.</v>

1225
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 4>It just wasn't working.</v>

1226
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 4>And if someone had been the audience youtubing that at the beginning when it was</v>

1227
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 4>eating Dick Stage,</v>

1228
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 4>he would have looked like an asshole right now.</v>

1229
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:55.101
<v Speaker 4>And tell people no,</v>

1231
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 4>just stick with me.</v>

1232
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:56.661
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be funny.</v>

1233
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 4>At one point talking about it and not only that,</v>

1234
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 4>but their joke gets released.</v>

1235
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:02.970
<v Speaker 4>It gets online and it's like,</v>

1236
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 4>which is really kind of a violation of what a comic is doing by working out a</v>

1237
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:07.750
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>

1238
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.050
<v Speaker 4>If you see someone at the seller,</v>

1239
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 4>if you see someone at the comedy store,</v>

1240
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.414
<v Speaker 4>at the Improv,</v>

1241
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 4>most of the time,</v>

1242
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 4>most of the time you see a comedian like you are like me.</v>

1243
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 4>We're working out stuff.</v>

1244
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're doing.</v>

1245
00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 4>This is our gym.</v>

1246
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 4>It's our workshop.</v>

1247
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 4>It's how these things.</v>

1248
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 4>When you.</v>

1249
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 4>When you see it on comedy central or if you see it in a headline club,</v>

1250
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 4>you see what the Irvine Improv on a weekend.</v>

1251
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Then you're seeing essentially a finished product,</v>

1252
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.180
<v Speaker 4>but all that other stuff is like,</v>

1253
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 4>that's how bits get work done.</v>

1254
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 4>We need an audience and I've done a lot of them that don't fucking own man and</v>

1255
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 4>then one day they do.</v>

1256
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been on stage doing this stupid set in town and just say something</v>

1257
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:45.231
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>

1258
00:34:45.231 --> 00:34:48.440
<v Speaker 4>just come to you like that retard or mean.</v>

1259
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I said something horrible about my wife's tits or something.</v>

1260
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 4>It just kind of blurted it out like I don't think that.</v>

1261
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to be funny.</v>

1262
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1263
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.581
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1264
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 4>You're just spitball and you're trying to and people will get angry at you about</v>

1265
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 4>the contents of your imagination.</v>

1266
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't understand,</v>

1267
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:05.654
<v Speaker 4>this is not,</v>

1268
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 4>this is performance,</v>

1269
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 4>this is not me as a human being given you my well thought out and clearly</v>

1270
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 4>analyzed views on life,</v>

1271
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1272
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

1273
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.590

1292
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've been paying attention,</v>

1293
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.691
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to that.</v>

1294
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:51.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1295

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw him.</v>

1297
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I saw him right after he had this joke that we do on stage at the cellar where</v>

1298
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 1>he said that,</v>

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:59.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1305
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 1>all these protests are really starting to fuck with my personal life,</v>

1306
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and those are the other day I'm having sex with this black chick.</v>

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1308

<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

1309
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:14.791

1310
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:15.001
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1311

1449
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.751
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1450
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:43.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it's like calling someone French from France.</v>

1452
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.823
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1453
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Are you from England?</v>

1454
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.093
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it,</v>

1455
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 3>but his thing was he was.</v>

1456
00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:52.540
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1457
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.950
<v Speaker 3>he's such a history of it.</v>

1458
00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1459
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows this is what he does and he does this kind of thing.</v>

1460
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So was he working the crowd the entire time?</v>

1461
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:00.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1462
00:40:00.321 --> 00:40:01.154
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a,</v>

1463
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.390
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a mix.</v>

1464
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Like he uh,</v>

1465
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.790
<v Speaker 2>he brought people up.</v>

1466
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:05.811
<v Speaker 2>He definitely,</v>

1467
00:40:05.811 --> 00:40:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I think when people on stage for a couple of people,</v>

1468
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.080
<v Speaker 2>two guys on stage,</v>

1469
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1470
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Not Walking very well.</v>

1471
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't walk very well know that something's happened to his knee or</v>

1472
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 2>something and uh,</v>

1473
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:17.900
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

1474
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.100
<v Speaker 2>You have all these show girls go up on stage and they do this big dance in the</v>

1475
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.330
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the show and they do like the feather thing,</v>

1476
00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1477
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.190
<v Speaker 2>they all stand there with the feathers,</v>

1478
00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Speaker 2>like a big scrim.</v>

1479
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.860
<v Speaker 2>And then they wheeled him out and put them up on a stool and then they all part</v>

1480
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.360
<v Speaker 2>and there's Don rickles.</v>

1481
00:40:32.361 --> 00:40:35.780
<v Speaker 2>He just appeared to see them walking and then he,</v>

1482
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:36.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1483
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1484
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.820
<v Speaker 2>look at the black guy over there,</v>

1485
00:40:37.821 --> 00:40:38.570
<v Speaker 2>look at that,</v>

1486
00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.360
<v Speaker 2>look at the [inaudible] over there and was doing the Hitler and crazy stuff.</v>

1487
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:43.971
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

1488
00:40:43.971 --> 00:40:44.511
<v Speaker 2>But he's just,</v>

1489
00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:44.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
00:40:44.721 --> 00:40:46.220
<v Speaker 2>you know the guy so well,</v>

1491
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.630
<v Speaker 2>you just know who he is.</v>

1492
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.583
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1493
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.710
<v Speaker 2>it's not coming from hate just as playful kind of guy.</v>

1495
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.730
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

1496
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I hope that there's somebody that's going to be like that for our generation.</v>

1497
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Should be somebody.</v>

1498
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.931
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1499
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I think like what you were saying about Tosh,</v>

1500
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 3>what we were saying about Jeff Ross,</v>

1501
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 3>like once you know what they do,</v>

1502
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.020
<v Speaker 3>if you just have to know what they do and you know there's going to be building</v>

1503
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.530
<v Speaker 3>complained,</v>

1504
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1505
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:09.214
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>

1506
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.240
<v Speaker 3>they get ignored,</v>

1507
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 3>they get marginalized and you're allowed to not like somebody managed.</v>

1508
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 3>People just don't like all sorts of folks that I enjoy.</v>

1509
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 3>My whole objective those two days was I just want to be shit on by him.</v>

1510
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.780

<v Speaker 1>It's a good one.</v>

1591
00:43:29.861 --> 00:43:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I never got a chance to meet Dangerfield,</v>

1592
00:43:31.451 --> 00:43:33.040
<v Speaker 1>but I stood next to him a couple times.</v>

1593
00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:33.720
<v Speaker 1>He did?</v>

1594
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1595
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1596
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:36.220
<v Speaker 1>He was doing some sets at the,</v>

1597
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:36.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1598
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.620
<v Speaker 1>at the laugh factory before he died,</v>

1599
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.330
<v Speaker 1>like a and he performed up until just a few years before he passed.</v>

1600
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:45.250
<v Speaker 1>And in the nineties,</v>

1601
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.340
<v Speaker 1>similar around the mid to late nineties,</v>

1602
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 1>he was doing sets occasionally he would drop in the laugh factory and I was</v>

1603
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.310
<v Speaker 1>really fortunate to be there a couple times when he did.</v>

1604
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.443
<v Speaker 1>Did he live out here?</v>

1605
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1606
00:43:56.141 --> 00:43:56.771
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1607
00:43:56.771 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I bet he probably lived a couple places.</v>

1608
00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty wealthy.</v>

1609
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1610
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.821
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1611
00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:01.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1612
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.141
<v Speaker 1>why don't you meet them though?</v>

1613
00:44:02.141 --> 00:44:02.990
<v Speaker 1>You were standing next to him.</v>

1614
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I was young and stupid and I didn't.</v>

1615
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't good enough.</v>

1616
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like it was good enough to introduce myself to him,</v>

1617
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:13.390
<v Speaker 1>that I was next to him once when I was an open mic or I just didn't feel like I</v>

1618
00:44:13.391 --> 00:44:14.740
<v Speaker 1>can introduce myself to them.</v>

1619
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Just wasn't good enough.</v>

1620
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it crazy to think there's some kids standing next to you now?</v>

1621
00:44:18.731 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I just can't.</v>

1622
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I just can't kid say high.</v>

1623
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're a comic,</v>

1624
00:44:23.891 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you know,</v>

1625
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:26.103
<v Speaker 1>but there was a.</v>

1626
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple moments where you're like,</v>

1627
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I saw Hicks live really two,</v>

1628
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1629
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.000
<v Speaker 1>three or four times,</v>

1630
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>probably three or four times at least three times in Boston.</v>

1631
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

1632
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And that was a raw open miker.</v>

1633
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I had been doing comedy maybe six months and I got a chance to see Hicks a</v>

1634
00:44:42.231 --> 00:44:42.901
<v Speaker 1>bunch of times.</v>

1635
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:43.880
<v Speaker 1>She has time.</v>

1636
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:44.723
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

1637
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.520
<v Speaker 1>How good was he?</v>

1638
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.270
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing,</v>

1639
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1640
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1641
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:47.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1642
00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 1>it just like the late eighties.</v>

1643
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 1>He was probably in his prime.</v>

1644
00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.360
<v Speaker 1>He died in [inaudible] 93 or 94.</v>

1645
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:58.194
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>

1646
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him when he was hopping.</v>

1647
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:00.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1648
00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:01.021
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1649
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he was on fire,</v>

1650
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1651
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 1>He was so good.</v>

1652
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing him and I never saw them live in some caroline's comedy hour</v>

1653
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 1>and just seeing how he was just like at the edge of the stage,</v>

1654
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.720
<v Speaker 1>cigarette in his hand is thinking some guy's face like I was like,</v>

1655
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.421
<v Speaker 1>what the hell.</v>

1656
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 1>This has been interesting to see how he evolved and grew because he was still</v>

1657
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.374
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

1658
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1659
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 1>he was like 32 or something like that.</v>

1660
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:22.254
<v Speaker 1>When he died,</v>

1661
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>he would have gotten a lot better.</v>

1662
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 1>It makes you seem so much older.</v>

1663
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1664
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 1>it makes you seem so much more legendary to.</v>

1665
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.931
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

1667
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 1>When someone dies,</v>

1668
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.060
<v Speaker 1>like everything that they did become so much more important than when it.</v>

1669
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 1>If they'd stayed alive.</v>

1670
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1671
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.733
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1672
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Like if Elvis was still alive today.</v>

1673
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

1674
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:43.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1675
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:44.700
<v Speaker 1>You just wrap it up.</v>

1676
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1677
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1678
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean like John Lennon and there's so much more valued by most people.</v>

1679
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Then Paul Mccartney.</v>

1680
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1682
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:51.841
<v Speaker 1>because Paul is showing up,</v>

1683
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 1>it would award shows and he's like,</v>

1684
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:53.461
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

1685
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm still alive and we get it when you're dead.</v>

1686
00:45:56.941 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna fucking love you dude.</v>

1687
00:45:59.010 --> 00:45:59.843
<v Speaker 1>Completely.</v>

1688
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw dangerfield when I was working,</v>

1689
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:02.791
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1690
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 1>before I was ever a comic.</v>

1691
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to see I.</v>

1692
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I worked at a concert place.</v>

1693
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1694
00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And I was backstage because there was a security guard and I was working in this</v>

1695
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 1>backstage area where I got to see dangerfield walking around behind the stage</v>

1696
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 1>with his bathrobe on his slippers and that's where he was performing.</v>

1697
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 1>He would perform in a bathrobe in the bathroom.</v>

1698
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>He'd gone totally naked,</v>

1699
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.550
<v Speaker 1>which throw a bathrobe on and just go on.</v>

1700
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

1701
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1702
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 1>He went through a period of time.</v>

1703
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how he was performing.</v>

1704
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.611
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1705
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1706
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 1>When I saw them at the laugh factory,</v>

1707
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 1>he was fully dressed,</v>

1708
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.830
<v Speaker 1>but he was doing this place called great woods.</v>

1709
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a concert place in Mansfield,</v>

1710
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.124
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

1711
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And this was the height of his popularity.</v>

1712
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:48.531
<v Speaker 1>This was like back to school during those days because this is like the</v>

1713
00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:49.141
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

1714
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 86 or something like before I did comedy,</v>

1715
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 1>that was probably 19,</v>

1716
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 1>so it must've been about 86 and uh,</v>

1717
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 1>he was just walking around with a bathrobe on.</v>

1718
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It would show shuffle on stage with slippers.</v>

1719
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I've got no respect that respect at all.</v>

1720
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.380
<v Speaker 1>My wife will tell you and you're just carrying the drink.</v>

1721
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.641
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1722
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:09.361
<v Speaker 1>It was carrying a drink.</v>

1723
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:09.901
<v Speaker 1>I just remember,</v>

1724
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 1>look at this bad motherfucker wearing a bathrobe.</v>

1725
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy and everybody wanted to talk about the fact that it had nothing on</v>

1726
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:16.434
<v Speaker 1>under the bathroom.</v>

1727
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:18.271
<v Speaker 1>The bathroom.</v>

1728
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:19.104
<v Speaker 1>He's totally naked.</v>

1729
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.123
<v Speaker 1>I saw his balls,</v>

1730
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 1>like he would just walk around.</v>

1731
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.201
<v Speaker 1>Is that him?</v>

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:06.000
<v Speaker 4>I guess you just do it so long.</v>

1757
00:48:06.001 --> 00:48:06.834
<v Speaker 4>You just like,</v>

1758
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.160
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1759
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1760
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean the balls of that guy to still do shows.</v>

1761
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 4>This is going down.</v>

1762
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I now.</v>

1763
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it goes online?</v>

1764
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.773
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1765
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.921
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1766
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I think he had people that.</v>

1767
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.181
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1768
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Because remember when he put up that meme,</v>

1769
00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:25.384
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

1770
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1771
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.200
<v Speaker 4>blew up in his face.</v>

1772
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.471
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1773
00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:29.520
<v Speaker 4>I have my own theories about that meme,</v>

1774
00:48:29.521 --> 00:48:29.991
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1775
00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I think that somebody who works for him,</v>

1776
00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.040
<v Speaker 4>he knew what the fuck was going to happen.</v>

1777
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1778
00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:35.970
<v Speaker 4>That's my,</v>

1779
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:36.801
<v Speaker 4>my feeling.</v>

1780
00:48:36.801 --> 00:48:37.634
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

1781
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.590
<v Speaker 4>And they just did it to get them.</v>

1782
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1783
00:48:39.951 --> 00:48:42.740
<v Speaker 4>I think that anybody who works in tech,</v>

1784
00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 4>anybody who designed to websites,</v>

1785
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.010
<v Speaker 4>you're savvy,</v>

1786
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Internet savvy,</v>

1787
00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.580
<v Speaker 4>and if you're one of those internet savvy people,</v>

1788
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.740
<v Speaker 4>he know what the fuck is gonna happen.</v>

1789
00:48:51.741 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 4>If you say me,</v>

1790
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.640
<v Speaker 4>me take a picture of him.</v>

1791
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.193

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.460
<v Speaker 6>Do you believe in any of this stuff?</v>

1807
00:49:17.101 --> 00:49:18.090
<v Speaker 6>whole theory and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1810
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:22.921
<v Speaker 2>It can go away.</v>

1813
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 4>That sentence is my uber driver</v>

1814
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.260
<v Speaker 4>who's not making the best fucking decisions.</v>

1815
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Picking up random strangers based on an APP.</v>

1816
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:36.311
<v Speaker 4>Get in my car,</v>

1817
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1818
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you what I think about Hollywood and the elite or what do you do in</v>

1819
00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:41.021
<v Speaker 4>that situation?</v>

1820
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Just kind of agree with them to make the conversation to get a free ride.</v>

1821
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.004
<v Speaker 4>That's what you do.</v>

1822
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:45.701
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1823
00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 6>He just had this whole theory and he connected with other celebrities that were,</v>

1824
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:51.430
<v Speaker 6>he thinks like Hollywood's just done with them.</v>

1825
00:49:51.431 --> 00:49:52.710
<v Speaker 6>So they throw him under the bus.</v>

1826
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

1827
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 6>Charlie Sheen,</v>

1828
00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1829
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.313
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

1830
00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Sheen was on tv talking about smoking rocks.</v>

1831
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.310
<v Speaker 4>And then from then he went to get a deal with fx that netted him somewhere in</v>

1832
00:50:06.311 --> 00:50:08.860
<v Speaker 4>the neighborhood of $500,000,000.</v>

1833
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 4>The same amount of money.</v>

1834
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:12.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1835
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't really got him.</v>

1836
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.540
<v Speaker 4>How much did he make off that fx thing?</v>

1837
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:17.470
<v Speaker 4>It was some insane amount of syndication.</v>

1838
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:18.400
<v Speaker 4>It was 100 episodes.</v>

1839
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 4>More than $100,000,000 he made off of that stupid fx thing.</v>

1840
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 4>And it's a terrible show.</v>

1841
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Anger management is a Goddamn.</v>

1842
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>No one even knows it's on together by</v>

1843
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 1>monkeys with head injuries.</v>

1844
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

1845
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1846
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:32.661
<v Speaker 1>it's so bad.</v>

1847
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:34.150
<v Speaker 1>You watched the punchlines like what?</v>

1848
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:34.911
<v Speaker 1>$200,</v>

1849
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:36.650

<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1852
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:38.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1853
00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:43.130
<v Speaker 1>they were riding on the waves of him leaving two and a half men what?</v>

1854
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1855
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 1>what were the other two and a half men.</v>

1856
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking executives that want to be seen.</v>

1857
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.291
<v Speaker 1>Look at me.</v>

1858
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big shot.</v>

1859
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like to do a blow and get hookers,</v>

1860
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1861
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Charlie?</v>

1862
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:53.571
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to make?</v>

1863
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:54.404
<v Speaker 1>How about a fortune?</v>

1864
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:55.731
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1865
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you guys fucked up the TV business.</v>

1866
00:50:57.591 --> 00:50:58.424
<v Speaker 1>He'd dumb asses.</v>

1867
00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.270
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1868
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 1>They tried to do that deal with a bunch of other shows to try to do it with</v>

1869
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 1>George Lopez and it fizzled out.</v>

1870
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1871
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:04.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1872
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:04.760
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1873
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 1>What they did is if you get past a certain amount of episodes,</v>

1874
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 1>they automatically pick it up for 100.</v>

1875
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Set it at 10.</v>

1876
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1877
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 1>If you get past 10,</v>

1878
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1879
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 1>they automatically pick it up for the back.</v>

1880
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:15.990
<v Speaker 1>90.</v>

1881
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1882
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

1883
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

1884
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 1>But some dummy agree to that based on the hype behind Charlie Sheen and the fact</v>

1885
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 1>that he was doing live shows with no material.</v>

1886
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1887
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about the live show.</v>

1888
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>How could you put on.</v>

1889
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 1>One of them was he was a bastard.</v>

1890
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

1891
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>But then our boy russell saved it.</v>

1892
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Russell Peters started doing shows with them and saved it because Russell's</v>

1893
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:46.100
<v Speaker 1>awesome comedian and started interviewing Charlie and being funny while he was</v>

1894
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:46.821
<v Speaker 1>interviewing them.</v>

1895
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 1>So Russell would crack some jokes,</v>

1896
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 1>asked some questions,</v>

1897
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 1>crack some more jokes,</v>

1898
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was entertained by it.</v>

1899
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And then Charlie could tell his crazy hooker stories in context of like a,</v>

1900
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1901
00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.270
<v Speaker 1>like a show Biz set your panel.</v>

1902
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Russell knows how to do theater,</v>

1904
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:02.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1905
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to entertain these people.</v>

1906
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.920
<v Speaker 1>He's acutely aware that all these folks are watching.</v>

1907
00:52:06.921 --> 00:52:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Charlie was just like,</v>

1908
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go out there and be Charlie Sheen and</v>

1909
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.201
<v Speaker 1>give us our money.</v>

1910
00:52:12.201 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1911
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.293
<v Speaker 1>already got your money.</v>

1912
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.073
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

1913
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Those were awful devastating.</v>

1914
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1915
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>he and he was in a panic after that and that's when they brought in comics and</v>

1916
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:25.370
<v Speaker 1>started bringing comics on the road with them.</v>

1917
00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:26.204
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1918
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:26.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1919
00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but that was riding the wave of that.</v>

1920
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 1>They did this anger management thing and you know,</v>

1921
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the first couple episodes probably weren't so bad,</v>

1922
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking terrible.</v>

1923
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1924
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>So take that aluminum 100 episodes and it's not even their fault.</v>

1925
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They're running 102 a week.</v>

1926
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1927
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

1928
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.640
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1929
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 1>how much time did they put into these fucking jokes?</v>

1930
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.040
<v Speaker 1>You can have almost none.</v>

1931
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Almost no time.</v>

1932
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.871
<v Speaker 1>There's hardly any time.</v>

1933
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 1>If you do one a week.</v>

1934
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1935
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard.</v>

1936
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Making a sitcom is fucking hard.</v>

1937
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

1938
00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I did it for five years.</v>

1939
00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It is not easy.</v>

1940
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>It becomes easier once things get jealous.</v>

1941
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.771
<v Speaker 1>But even then,</v>

1942
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:04.071
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1943
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:05.990
<v Speaker 1>writers fucking hit blocks.</v>

1944
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what you mean.</v>

1945
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:09.120
<v Speaker 1>There was days like we were in news radio,</v>

1946
00:53:09.121 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 1>like season four,</v>

1947
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 1>there was days where the scriptures didn't fucking work.</v>

1948
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 1>These grinding,</v>

1949
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 1>these writers had busted their ass and banged against the keyboards and they</v>

1950
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:21.600
<v Speaker 1>just couldn't find a way to make this scene work and they have what they've</v>

1951
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 1>abandoned a whole scenes and putting on new ones and rewrite things the next</v>

1952
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:26.930
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1953
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Were you involved in writing at all at that point?</v>

1954
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Not Writing,</v>

1955
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:35.091
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote a lot of the jokes that I sat on the show I did ad Lib done on what</v>

1956
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:39.140
<v Speaker 1>we do is onset the way the way work with Newsradio.</v>

1957
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Paul Simms,</v>

1958
00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 1>who is a creative genius,</v>

1959
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.751
<v Speaker 1>so really,</v>

1960
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy,</v>

1961
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but also he had a really healthy ego,</v>

1962
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 1>like it didn't have to be his words that were read,</v>

1963
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 1>so he would write things.</v>

1964
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:56.121
<v Speaker 1>And then Dave Foley was really like an uncredited producer of that show is dave</v>

1965
00:53:56.611 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 1>rewrote entire scenes.</v>

1966
00:53:58.231 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 1>He rewrote jokes,</v>

1967
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:03.780
<v Speaker 1>wrote jokes for me and for Vicky Lewis and for Andy different everybody.</v>

1968
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:04.890
<v Speaker 1>He rewrote stuff.</v>

1969
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And then would present this new version of it and dave was like really</v>

1970
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:09.601
<v Speaker 1>respectful.</v>

1971
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have this idea,</v>

1972
00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:11.514
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to see it.</v>

1973
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.451
<v Speaker 1>And Paul was like,</v>

1974
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1975
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.493
<v Speaker 1>let's see what you got.</v>

1976
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And then Paul would be like,</v>

1977
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:15.631
<v Speaker 1>I like yours better,</v>

1978
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 1>let's go with that.</v>

1979
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:16.951
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1980
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And so like literally 40 percent of that show,</v>

1981
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:25.401
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more was adlibbed set by by either fully or Andy ad libbed a lot of</v>

1982
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:27.151
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1983
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I ad libbed a lot of stuff we wrote for each other now.</v>

1984
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.291
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you know,</v>

1985
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:33.720
<v Speaker 1>you'd see Andy doing something and I would go,</v>

1986
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:34.501
<v Speaker 1>why don't you say this?</v>

1987
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And be like,</v>

1988
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

1989
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:36.631
<v Speaker 1>or no,</v>

1990
00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>or Vicky or whoever.</v>

1991
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like that sort of environment where you can all contribute.</v>

1992
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:42.300
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1993
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it just makes it better show,</v>

1994
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's not always that you get a cast that can do that and think about that.</v>

1995
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Just those names that you're using.</v>

1996
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Just this great.</v>

1997
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a killer.</v>

1998
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's how difficult it is to just pull up a show.</v>

1999
00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Use having all those killer,</v>

2000
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:57.354
<v Speaker 1>all that talent.</v>

2001
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman,</v>

2002
00:54:58.321 --> 00:54:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Root,</v>

2003
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and one of the few that didn't run,</v>

2004
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.600
<v Speaker 1>he didn't ad Lib anything.</v>

2005
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Root would get the script and he would.</v>

2006
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 1>He was a character like if you talked to him,</v>

2007
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:09.820
<v Speaker 1>will you see him on Newsradio?</v>

2008
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>You assume that he's that guy.</v>

2009
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 1>He's nothing like that guy.</v>

2010
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 1>He's the sweetest guy ever.</v>

2011
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:14.421
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2012
00:55:14.421 --> 00:55:16.120
<v Speaker 1>he's so nice and normal when you meet them,</v>

2013
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.161
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2014
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:18.090
<v Speaker 1>he'd had this.</v>

2015
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy James Character was a character that he developed.</v>

2016
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 1>He was the him and Phil Hartman with the ones who were like.</v>

2017
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>They were like characters.</v>

2018
00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2019
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2020
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 1>They had developed the character.</v>

2021
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine doing two of those a week.</v>

2022
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:29.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2023
00:55:29.281 --> 00:55:30.114
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>

2024
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck anybody would do it.</v>

2025
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2026
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2027
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:37.821
<v Speaker 1>but doing two of them a week without Dave Foley and without Paul Simms and maybe</v>

2028
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 1>the people that are writing that show were good.</v>

2029
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:40.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2030
00:55:40.451 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2031
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but also there's no fucking incentive.</v>

2032
00:55:43.621 --> 00:55:45.480
<v Speaker 1>When you got 90 episodes picked up.</v>

2033
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2034
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.490
<v Speaker 1>let's just smell this in go,</v>

2035
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2036
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:49.853
<v Speaker 1>we're stuck here.</v>

2037
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2038
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you've got the GIG already.</v>

2039
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Gigs not going to go away right now.</v>

2040
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to pull those things off the air.</v>

2041
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2042
00:55:58.850 --> 00:55:59.683
<v Speaker 1>that is rough.</v>

2043
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Illuminati,</v>

2044
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.311
<v Speaker 2>Illuminati.</v>

2045
00:56:03.311 --> 00:56:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Is that organized?</v>

2046
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2047
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the Illuminati is.</v>

2048
00:56:07.991 --> 00:56:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I just consider it like Hollywood is with this uber driver was talking about.</v>

2049
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.150
<v Speaker 1>People always want to think that when it doesn't work out for them.</v>

2050
00:56:16.151 --> 00:56:17.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about Hollywood.</v>

2051
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.730
<v Speaker 1>They all want to think that there's some sort of grand conspiracy,</v>

2052
00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.660
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent,</v>

2053
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:23.963
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2054
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I think that with A.</v>

2055
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you talk to like you know,</v>

2056
00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm around comedians all the time,</v>

2057
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 3>so depending on who you're talking to,</v>

2058
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.943
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>

2059
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.700
<v Speaker 3>well they don't want.</v>

2060
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

2061
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.290
<v Speaker 3>they're not looking for white guys.</v>

2062
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 3>And then you talk to your other buddies like they're not looking for black guys</v>

2063
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 3>because he's black and whether or not Asians,</v>

2064
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:42.191
<v Speaker 3>there's only one Asian.</v>

2065
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 3>You can gather everybody wherever you are,</v>

2066
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you think they don't want,</v>

2067
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 3>but if you can create something and that something is popular and that's</v>

2068
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:52.180
<v Speaker 3>something is sellable and then people are buying it and everybody loves it,</v>

2069
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the beautiful things about being a comic is that you can prove it</v>

2070
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.613
<v Speaker 3>on your own.</v>

2071
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:00.490
<v Speaker 3>If you develop a following and you go on stage and you start killing it on the</v>

2072
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 3>road and everybody wants to come see you,</v>

2073
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 3>they want to do a show with Tom,</v>

2074
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:04.510
<v Speaker 3>papa,</v>

2075
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.811
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

2076
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do?</v>

2077
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.303
<v Speaker 3>How do we get a po?</v>

2078
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 3>How do we get a piece of this money and time trying to figure out how to profit</v>

2079
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 3>off of what you're doing?</v>

2080
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:11.981
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2081
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:12.491
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2082
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 3>You know this idea that there's some sort of a grand conspiracy.</v>

2083
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Know what you're selling sucks,</v>

2084
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:16.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2085
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:17.690
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're selling.</v>

2086
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>You're selling is nothing.</v>

2087
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2088
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:19.631
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2089
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2090
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 3>and no one's interested.</v>

2091
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 3>That's conspiracy.</v>

2092
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.213
<v Speaker 3>Conspiracy.</v>

2093
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 3>People are conspiring to only put things that they like on TV.</v>

2094
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.023
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2095
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.701
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2096
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:31.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't fit into that plane.</v>

2097
00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2098
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Bill Cosby is a part of a grand conspiracy.</v>

2099
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.993
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2100
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 3>They ties all these different women and they got them to say the exact same</v>

2101
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:42.034
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2102
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And Randy Quaid,</v>

2103
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:45.400
<v Speaker 3>did you see that video ratings crazy as fuck.</v>

2104
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2105
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 3>quaid crazy as fuck.</v>

2106
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:48.280
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

2107
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 3>He released a new video today where he knew him really well.</v>

2108
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's the same one.</v>

2109
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the crazy white beard and he puts a mask on his girlfriend simulates.</v>

2110
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.370
<v Speaker 3>So these fucking bad acting really nice.</v>

2111
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 3>She's gone nuts.</v>

2112
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:05.464
<v Speaker 3>He went crazy.</v>

2113
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.120
<v Speaker 3>He went crazy a couple of years ago,</v>

2114
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.050
<v Speaker 3>owed a lot of money and there was like a house that he was living in.</v>

2115
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.220
<v Speaker 3>They kicked him out and he was running from hotels,</v>

2116
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 3>seed ranch.</v>

2117
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Real expensive place.</v>

2118
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful place,</v>

2119
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2120
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 3>You can crank up a real big bill and a couple of days and he stayed for six days</v>

2121
00:58:21.941 --> 00:58:22.774
<v Speaker 3>and then split.</v>

2122
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.113
<v Speaker 3>Didn't pay it.</v>

2123
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.870
<v Speaker 3>He did that a couple of places.</v>

2124
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

2125
00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:27.290
<v Speaker 3>it got weird.</v>

2126
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2127
00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:27.860
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2128
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2129
00:58:28.121 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 3>when people get old,</v>

2130
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:29.944
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

2131
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 3>they have a tendency for centricity and then as they get old that morphs into</v>

2132
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:35.501
<v Speaker 3>full blown.</v>

2133
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2134
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2135
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:36.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2136
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like you got a little bit of a cold and then next thing you got aids.</v>

2137
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:44.920
<v Speaker 3>What's really weird is that his girlfriend is out of your control is his wife is</v>

2138
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.030
<v Speaker 3>on the on board though,</v>

2139
00:58:46.031 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 3>so it almost seems like maybe they're just drug addicts together instead of</v>

2140
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>being a crazy thing because the fact that she's not like,</v>

2141
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 3>my husband's going crazy.</v>

2142
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:55.900
<v Speaker 3>They might just be parts of both.</v>

2143
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Get on the same page with that.</v>

2144
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.390
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

2145
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2146
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.860
<v Speaker 3>It might be messed up.</v>

2147
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.140
<v Speaker 3>They're not using their drugs like they don't put.</v>

2148
00:59:02.141 --> 00:59:02.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2149
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 3>they're actors just don't do drugs,</v>

2150
00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.143
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2151
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Gene in this conspiracy the fuck.</v>

2152
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:13.264
<v Speaker 3>I've</v>

2153
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:19.870
<v Speaker 3>been interviewed by the ABC talking about doing rocks and rocks.</v>

2154
00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:20.471
<v Speaker 3>You remember that?</v>

2155
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2156
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 3>That's how I roll.</v>

2157
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2158
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.073
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2159

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.670
<v Speaker 4>There was a scientist that got in trouble.</v>

2232
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 4>They landed on a comet.</v>

2233
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:38.750
<v Speaker 4>They landed a robot on a comment and the guy who was celebrating it,</v>

2234
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 4>he wore a shirt that his friend designed.</v>

2235
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 4>It was his friend who's into like rockabilly sort of pin up girl type stuff and</v>

2236
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:47.510
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

2240
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.820
<v Speaker 4>that was like an homage to his friend because his friend made him that shirt and</v>

2241
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:56.270
<v Speaker 4>that's what she does.</v>

2242
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.901

<v Speaker 4>She brings home girls and all this different jazz and uh,</v>

2303
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:34.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2304
01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:34.291
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2305
01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:34.811
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about,</v>

2306
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:34.951
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2307
01:03:34.951 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 4>it's just sex.</v>

2308
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.700
<v Speaker 4>And then one day he got ahold of her contract and the contract said air tight.</v>

2309
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.860
<v Speaker 4>It was like in the contract and he was like,</v>

2310
01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:44.670
<v Speaker 4>what's airtight?</v>

2311
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 4>She's like a Dick and every hole.</v>

2312
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:46.140
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2313
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:46.973
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>

2314
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Done sober on track.</v>

2315
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.980
<v Speaker 4>This is not my special lady.</v>

2316
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:54.560
<v Speaker 4>This is not my specialty.</v>

2317
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 4>He just.</v>

2318
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

2319
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 4>that was the breaking point.</v>

2320
01:03:56.941 --> 01:03:58.320
<v Speaker 4>I can't explain that one to my mom.</v>

2321
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:02.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just sitting in there going air air tight.</v>

2322
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.633
<v Speaker 4>And that was it.</v>

2323
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.121
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2324
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:06.321
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2325
01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:06.700
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2326
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.411
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2327
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Like he was cool.</v>

2328
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 4>He was cool with her,</v>

2329
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 4>with two guys.</v>

2330
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 4>He was cool with her,</v>

2331
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:13.410
<v Speaker 4>but three was it.</v>

2332
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Three was where he just about air tight.</v>

2333
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:26.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's a sure sign this too much porn being made right.</v>

2334
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.061
<v Speaker 4>That a plug.</v>

2335
01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Every hole has it been done?</v>

2336
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 4>No plug and plug it up.</v>

2337
01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:31.254
<v Speaker 4>We're innovators.</v>

2338
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:32.071
<v Speaker 4>Get that little guy.</v>

2339
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:33.070
<v Speaker 4>We got two years to fill</v>

2340
01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.393
<v Speaker 4>a lawyer.</v>

2341
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Drafting that contract to squirt and lube and your ear and just grabbing a top</v>

2342
01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 4>and a bottom and just the two midgets or making out.</v>

2343
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 4>So they're gay.</v>

2344
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.720
<v Speaker 4>If they're making out with each other,</v>

2345
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 4>whether they skull fucker ears and another guy's fucking her mouth,</v>

2346
01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 4>put that on a shirt.</v>

2347
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:54.090
<v Speaker 4>It's probably been done.</v>

2348
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.320
<v Speaker 4>We probably were wrong.</v>

2349
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.350
<v Speaker 4>It's probably been done.</v>

2350
01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can think up anything that hasn't probably at this point,</v>

2351
01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2352
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:01.890
<v Speaker 4>It's probably Asian man.</v>

2353
01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:02.900
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2354
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2355
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:05.800
<v Speaker 4>What year was the first asked to mouth done?</v>

2356
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean that had to be in the two thousands.</v>

2357
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:09.571
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2358
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:10.404
<v Speaker 4>That didn't exist.</v>

2359
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to the glory days of like a Ginger Lynn and Ron,</v>

2360
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy and Peter North,</v>

2361
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 4>there was no to mouth.</v>

2362
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>They didn't</v>

2363
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.843
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

2364
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:21.920
<v Speaker 3>It was just people having sex fashion.</v>

2365
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Good time.</v>

2366
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Like when Don rickles does that show,</v>

2367
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:31.530
<v Speaker 3>he's got a silver robot and slip as that show business we didn't have to do what</v>

2368
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you do have to do as to mouth are tighter in this fucking midget fucking your</v>

2369
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:39.270
<v Speaker 3>ear and nonsense gimmicks.</v>

2370
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 3>It's what you rely on when you got no talent.</v>

2371
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like boogie nights.</v>

2372
01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't do video.</v>

2373
01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I make film.</v>

2374
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Do Video.</v>

2375
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Do they even make films anymore with film?</v>

2376
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 3>They don't use film anymore,</v>

2377
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2378
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Some do.</v>

2379
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Do they hardly do for movies,</v>

2380
01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:58.623
<v Speaker 3>but you could bring.</v>

2381
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.080
<v Speaker 3>There's some directors that only want to shoot film because they don't believe</v>

2382
01:06:02.081 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 3>in the whole digital Tarantino.</v>

2383
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.493
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2384
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.040
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man.</v>

2385
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Think documentaries.</v>

2386
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:14.221
<v Speaker 3>A lot of documentaries maybe still be on film photographers to believe in</v>

2387
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:15.370
<v Speaker 3>photography like that.</v>

2388
01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 3>It has to like digital photography,</v>

2389
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 3>like some something's missing,</v>

2390
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.743
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2391
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else sees.</v>

2392
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like when people are like,</v>

2393
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2394
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 3>you've got to use this gold cable for your system.</v>

2395
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:26.390
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna,</v>

2396
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2397
01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:31.651
<v Speaker 3>you can use an instagram filter to achieve all that you fuck for free.</v>

2398
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the new star wars movie,</v>

2400
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:40.261
<v Speaker 3>they're not using like CGI this time around or they're using like old school</v>

2401
01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 3>like puppets and like how they used to do it.</v>

2402
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.590
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be pretty cool.</v>

2403
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So there was definitely an overload of CGI where you're just like,</v>

2404
01:06:48.911 --> 01:06:51.850
<v Speaker 3>am I if I'm watching a video game at this point?</v>

2405
01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 3>The Guy who directed my last comedy special in wanting to do it in black and</v>

2407
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

2408
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Steven Spielberg will bird did his in black and white,</v>

2409
01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:00.960
<v Speaker 3>but I think he actually filmed it.</v>

2410
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2411
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.193
<v Speaker 3>maybe he didn't,</v>

2412
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:02.680
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

2413
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.760
<v Speaker 3>This was before that,</v>

2414
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 3>before birth or even before I even knew bill doing isn't black and white and I</v>

2415
01:07:08.471 --> 01:07:08.591
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2416
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's already in color.</v>

2417
01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Like why would they do that?</v>

2418
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.833
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2419
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Why not just draw it,</v>

2420
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>take all the frames and drop everything I'm doing.</v>

2421
01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Just do your best colorize it.</v>

2422
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Have an option to make it black and white by turning it on and off on your TV.</v>

2423
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:31.310
<v Speaker 3>You can make any special black and white if you can do that.</v>

2424
01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2425
01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 3>But if you fuck with the contrast in the color color,</v>

2426
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.381
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2427
01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just so weird.</v>

2428
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:41.431
<v Speaker 3>This desire for the archaic to go back to the old old timey camera and I'm going</v>

2429
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:42.810
<v Speaker 3>to put the fucking needle on the</v>

2430
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 3>turntable that you got me.</v>

2431
01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Like it's still not working right?</v>

2432
01:07:47.441 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Do we ever do anything about that?</v>

2433
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2434
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with it?</v>

2435
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:50.651
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

2436
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:51.191
<v Speaker 3>Get on the ball.</v>

2437
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:52.024
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2438
01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:52.541
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2439
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:53.141
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

2440
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:53.591
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't working.</v>

2441
01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I got my daughter a turntable and it didn't work.</v>

2442
01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:56.351
<v Speaker 3>We have to bring it back.</v>

2443
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Then the other thing that starts skipping,</v>

2444
01:07:57.761 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2445
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.133
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2446
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 3>this is why we stopped seeing this kind of shitty.</v>

2447
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.073
<v Speaker 3>It's cool though.</v>

2448
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable that the sound is a little different.</v>

2449
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable.</v>

2450
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2451
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 3>apparently there's a new walkman that's expensive as fuck.</v>

2452
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a new Sony Walkman</v>

2453
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's an MP three recorder that is supposed to have the most incredible</v>

2454
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:26.021
<v Speaker 1>premium sound and Sony just released this at the latest video show,</v>

2455
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>the consumer electronics show in Vegas in Vegas,</v>

2456
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's a big gamble because it's like more than a thousand bucks.</v>

2457
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

2458
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2459
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:35.511
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

2460
01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up and we'll try this little while Neil Young's book or read about</v>

2461
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Neil Young's book.</v>

2462
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.253
<v Speaker 1>He has this.</v>

2463
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Sony wants you to buy a 1000,</v>

2464
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>$200.</v>

2465
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>MP three player.</v>

2466
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.963
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2467
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.863
<v Speaker 1>What's that sound?</v>

2468
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:49.833
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>

2469
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you're hearing a sound stopped.</v>

2470
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Was on this cable.</v>

2471
01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2472
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:55.781
<v Speaker 1>the Kayla.</v>

2473
01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Does that chronic as we're talking about better sound?</v>

2474
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2475
01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2476
01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Ironic.</v>

2477
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.151
<v Speaker 1>Last one.</v>

2478
01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Sone.</v>

2479
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.141
<v Speaker 1>Finally unveil.</v>

2480
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>New Walkman MP.</v>

2481
01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:06.924
<v Speaker 1>Three player.</v>

2482
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Which many have been expected for some time.</v>

2483
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.020
<v Speaker 1>People first got to look at device at ces.</v>

2484
01:09:11.021 --> 01:09:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 15 was asleep design or excellent ergonomics that caught people's</v>

2485
01:09:14.711 --> 01:09:15.011
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2486
01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It was the price tag.</v>

2487
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:20.050
<v Speaker 1>The zx priced at just under 1000,</v>

2488
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.880
<v Speaker 1>$200 for.</v>

2489
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.570
<v Speaker 1>That's more than a phone which already has an MP three player.</v>

2490
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:26.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

2492
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

2493
01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2494
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Because it sounds so great as the audio files choice,</v>

2495
01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>a new focus of the music and,</v>

2496
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:35.771
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see.</v>

2497
01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that this kind of,</v>

2498
01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.680
<v Speaker 1>this kind of technology will exist in phones soon.</v>

2499
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2500
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:42.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2501
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.550
<v Speaker 1>But to buy it as a handheld outside,</v>

2502
01:09:45.551 --> 01:09:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a fucking thing outside of my phone.</v>

2503
01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.473
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2504
01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I have one for phone.</v>

2505
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.970
<v Speaker 1>My phone has a 128 fucking gigabytes.</v>

2506
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:58.390
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of God damn songs in this thing and I'm not buying something</v>

2507
01:09:58.391 --> 01:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2508
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:59.300
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2509
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:04.300
<v Speaker 6>And if I took a MP three file that was say record at 1:28 kilobits per second or</v>

2510
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:05.091
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

2511
01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:05.780
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

2512
01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 6>twice that played both of them.</v>

2513
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 6>I really doubt most of us would even care or hear the difference in it at all.</v>

2514
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:12.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2515
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2516
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 1>what does matter though is really good.</v>

2517
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:15.321
<v Speaker 1>Headphones.</v>

2518
01:10:15.321 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2519
01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:16.131
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>

2520
01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:16.964
<v Speaker 1>Headphones matter,</v>

2521
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>my kids can play like their phones,</v>

2522
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the coldplay song just in that speaker and just leave it and it's Gacaca Gacaca</v>

2523
01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:25.790
<v Speaker 1>and they love it and it really drives me crazy.</v>

2524
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I just came here.</v>

2525
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 1>That lame quality.</v>

2526
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It just drives me nuts.</v>

2527
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I have these earbuds from.</v>

2528
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:32.984
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2529
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2530
01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And they have like steel braided cables that are covered with plastic or they're</v>

2531
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 1>very expensive and I was like,</v>

2532
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:39.981
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2533
01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:40.700
<v Speaker 1>let me just,</v>

2534
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 1>just for a goof by these things and see if it makes a difference.</v>

2535
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big fucking.</v>

2536
01:10:44.721 --> 01:10:45.201
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

2537
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:45.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2538
01:10:45.381 --> 01:10:47.740
<v Speaker 1>They have like drivers inside the ears,</v>

2539
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:48.591
<v Speaker 1>like the little,</v>

2540
01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but they feel weird phone.</v>

2541
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2542
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.101
<v Speaker 1>plug it into my phone.</v>

2543
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fantastic.</v>

2544
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And they're like blown away like the regular.</v>

2545
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2546
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:55.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2547
01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a bit quieter.</v>

2548
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:57.430
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a bit better,</v>

2549
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:58.221
<v Speaker 1>is it.</v>

2551
01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how much it costs a lot of money though,</v>

2552
01:11:00.801 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2553
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it like a thousand dollars better?</v>

2554
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:03.854
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2555
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.140
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2556
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting that driver thing,</v>

2557
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 6>because beats when they were still together with Dr Dre and beats,</v>

2558
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:09.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2559
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 6>they used their own special driver.</v>

2560
01:11:11.781 --> 01:11:14.140
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people complain that it was really basic</v>

2561
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 3>and too,</v>

2562
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 3>too much base now that they broke up.</v>

2563
01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I just got a new pair and it's completely different.</v>

2564
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:22.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like it doesn't even seem like the same headphones even though it was</v>

2565
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.591
<v Speaker 3>specific.</v>

2566
01:11:23.591 --> 01:11:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Almost exactly the same headphones I used to have the same but it doesn't sound</v>

2567
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 3>the same reading and they're bluetooth now.</v>

2568
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 3>So you just have these awesome headphones.</v>

2569
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:32.010
<v Speaker 3>You can answer calls on them.</v>

2570
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:32.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's great.</v>

2571
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:33.770
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

2572
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 3>And you guys are tech savvy.</v>

2573
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.610
<v Speaker 3>He's a Lebron,</v>

2574
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2575
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>he's doing like the beats,</v>

2576
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 3>wireless,</v>

2577
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 3>things like that working out.</v>

2578
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:43.980
<v Speaker 3>So if you're running though,</v>

2579
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.200
<v Speaker 3>that means you're like I run with a shuffle,</v>

2580
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2581
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>

2582
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 3>But that's not bluetooth.</v>

2583
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Now you can't do it with a shuffle,</v>

2584
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:51.790
<v Speaker 3>but you mean you can.</v>

2585
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm running through the streets,</v>

2586
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 3>but the IPOD shuffle,</v>

2587
01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2588
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Those little tiny ones with the clip on those dope.</v>

2589
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Just put them right on your waistband and go,</v>

2590
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2591
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 3>you can't use the wireless now for that.</v>

2592
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:04.980
<v Speaker 3>See what you need is a fucking phone and a fanny pack.</v>

2593
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's scared of Goddamn fanny packs.</v>

2594
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 3>It's the way to go.</v>

2595
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:09.360
<v Speaker 3>You slipped out,</v>

2596
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:10.440
<v Speaker 3>sucker right in there,</v>

2597
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 3>clip it down and go run and do whatever they have.</v>

2598
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 3>You're running with your phone?</v>

2599
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:15.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2600
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I run with my phone.</v>

2601
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.741
<v Speaker 3>That makes me nervous.</v>

2602
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't really run though.</v>

2603
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 3>They had to use for like running type stuff.</v>

2604
01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I do everything on a treadmill or on a.</v>

2605
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.610
<v Speaker 3>not even a treadmill.</v>

2606
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Usually elliptical machine.</v>

2607
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.440
<v Speaker 3>You're not running through the streets like a maniac.</v>

2608
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I do plenty of pounding with my joint hitting things.</v>

2609
01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to do extra pounding for a budget.</v>

2610
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I think I've already taken chances with my joints from kickboxing.</v>

2611
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:36.301
<v Speaker 3>Fuck with it.</v>

2612
01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:37.410
<v Speaker 3>With all that other stuff.</v>

2613
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2614
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.800
<v Speaker 3>I just stopped getting nervous up running with my phone.</v>

2615
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:41.641
<v Speaker 3>They have those cases.</v>

2616
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I have one that your phone goes in and it just goes on your own and those are</v>

2617
01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:47.400
<v Speaker 3>good and you don't even feel like you have it on there.</v>

2618
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2619
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.511
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the.</v>

2620
01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't have the plus though.</v>

2621
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:50.334
<v Speaker 3>You have the six.</v>

2622
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I went back down to the six.</v>

2623
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:52.703
<v Speaker 3>You have a blessed.</v>

2624
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.013
<v Speaker 3>Do you like it?</v>

2625
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:54.913
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2626
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I got the six and I feel like I should have gotten a bigger.</v>

2627
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.380
<v Speaker 3>What's better?</v>

2628
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 3>The battery life is tremendous.</v>

2629
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:01.290
<v Speaker 3>It's so great.</v>

2630
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 3>The battery's good for like couple of days.</v>

2631
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.850
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

2632
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:06.421
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2633
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 3>like I can listen to music.</v>

2634
01:13:07.711 --> 01:13:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I believe I bring it to when I do shows,</v>

2635
01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I have a bluetooth hooked up to this little speaker.</v>

2636
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I set the speaker up in the green room.</v>

2637
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.300
<v Speaker 3>I play music with it and then I get onstage.</v>

2638
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 3>I record all my sets with it and I go to shows with that,</v>

2639
01:13:19.321 --> 01:13:20.041
<v Speaker 3>play in the music,</v>

2640
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:21.220
<v Speaker 3>all that and pictures.</v>

2641
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:22.343
<v Speaker 3>No braylee,</v>

2642
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.213
<v Speaker 3>no problems.</v>

2643
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 3>The battery does go on.</v>

2644
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:24.571
<v Speaker 3>The sixth one.</v>

2645
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:25.610
<v Speaker 3>You're listening to the last supper.</v>

2646
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Watching stuff goes.</v>

2647
01:13:27.391 --> 01:13:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean the six is essentially the same batteries.</v>

2648
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.233
<v Speaker 3>A five,</v>

2649
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.900
<v Speaker 3>the five s it's the same battery.</v>

2650
01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.491
<v Speaker 3>It is this.</v>

2651
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>This basically the same battery life but a larger screen.</v>

2653
01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of counters.</v>

2654
01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 3>It might be a slightly larger battery,</v>

2655
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 3>but a larger screen.</v>

2656
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.520
<v Speaker 3>I always buy the wrong stuff to do.</v>

2657
01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:41.354
<v Speaker 3>You could</v>

2658
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.920
<v Speaker 3>get a new one,</v>

2659
01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.753
<v Speaker 3>give it away,</v>

2660
01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:45.060
<v Speaker 3>give it to somebody,</v>

2661
01:13:45.061 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 3>to somebody.</v>

2662
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 3>Give it to your kid.</v>

2663
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:47.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2665
01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.613
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>

2666
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.430
<v Speaker 3>first world problem.</v>

2667
01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I always find things twice.</v>

2668
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm never like think things through.</v>

2669
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I had to make the right purpose.</v>

2670
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I have a podcast phone for the studio that's a Samsung Galaxy s five and there's</v>

2671
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.640
<v Speaker 3>parts of that that I liked better than the iphone.</v>

2672
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:06.900
<v Speaker 3>A little bit smaller.</v>

2673
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 3>It's five inches instead of a.</v>

2674
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.820
<v Speaker 3>is this just because you're friends with Newell Brands?</v>

2675
01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Like five point five now?</v>

2676
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say anything that gets Neal Brennan in trouble,</v>

2677
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but he might not always use the phone all the time.</v>

2678
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

2679
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>What I like about this,</v>

2680
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.913
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2681
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung is this little bad boy right here.</v>

2682
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>This thing would it clips in place before you can drop it in the toilet.</v>

2683
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking waterproof.</v>

2684
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It water resistant,</v>

2685
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking thing and go under water and be fine.</v>

2686
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if this bitch goes underwater,</v>

2687
01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.173
<v Speaker 1>it's a dead man.</v>

2688
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing scarier than like having a glass of water next to your phone on</v>

2689
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>the counter and it's got a heartbeat detector right there.</v>

2690
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>You put your finger over there and it shows you your heartbeat to see if you're</v>

2691
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>in love.</v>

2692
01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2693
01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:52.301
<v Speaker 1>it's very important.</v>

2694
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:53.134
<v Speaker 1>It's a mood ring,</v>

2695
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>which you can do with apps and now the Apps,</v>

2696
01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 1>the way you put your finger over the,</v>

2697
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it actually measures.</v>

2698
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 1>They have an app on the iphone where it measures the,</v>

2699
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:08.011
<v Speaker 1>uses the flash from the camera and it pulses on your finger and actually</v>

2700
01:15:08.441 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 1>measures the,</v>

2701
01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:09.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2702
01:15:09.811 --> 01:15:14.170
<v Speaker 1>the heartbeats from reading with the Camera Lens and reading your,</v>

2703
01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2704
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2705
01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the light on your finger.</v>

2706
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2707
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Easy,</v>

2708
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2709
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.941
<v Speaker 1>He's a great world.</v>

2710
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 1>We live in.</v>

2711
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.800
<v Speaker 1>What I like about this though,</v>

2712
01:15:20.801 --> 01:15:23.080
<v Speaker 1>there's two things that I like about the Samsung first,</v>

2713
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>the big one is you could take the fucking battery out and put a new one in.</v>

2714
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So if your battery runs dry extra in your bank,</v>

2715
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you put a separate battery pack and you have a full charge instantly.</v>

2716
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Then also I like,</v>

2717
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you can add memory,</v>

2718
01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>you could stick a little memory card in there and you get an extra 128 gigs.</v>

2719
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:41.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2720
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:42.184
<v Speaker 1>But you don't,</v>

2721
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't seem as cool.</v>

2722
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Were you trying to impress Tom Pop?</v>

2723
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everybody I think.</v>

2724
01:15:48.581 --> 01:15:49.414
<v Speaker 1>Well we,</v>

2725
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no perfect phone is what I'm saying.</v>

2726
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.880
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of this that I love seeing the two phone numbers.</v>

2727
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.863
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2728
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:56.991
<v Speaker 1>This is the uh,</v>

2729
01:15:56.991 --> 01:15:57.850
<v Speaker 1>the studio phone.</v>

2730
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

2731
01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2732
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.823
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

2733
01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.253
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2734
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.643
<v Speaker 1>this is better.</v>

2735
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.760
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2736
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2737
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>This is a better operating system.</v>

2738
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.250
<v Speaker 1>The iphone operating system is clearly better.</v>

2739
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2740
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And the iphone camera is a little better too,</v>

2741
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty God damn good.</v>

2742
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean the difference between the galaxy operating system and the iphone and the</v>

2743
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.840
<v Speaker 1>camera and the camera.</v>

2744
01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And this is.</v>

2745
01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of splitting hairs.</v>

2746
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:23.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2747
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.421
<v Speaker 1>It feels the same.</v>

2748
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:26.254
<v Speaker 1>Brian Disagree.</v>

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you fucked with the SRO?</v>

2750
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Apple if you fucked with the galaxy s five.</v>

2751
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2752
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard a lot of complaints about the Svi,</v>

2753
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 1>especially with the a thumbprint sensors</v>

2754
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>sensor is dog shit.</v>

2758
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It's dog shit.</v>

2817
01:17:51.311 --> 01:17:51.671

01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:53.020

2827
01:18:00.661 --> 01:18:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I only use one thumb on this fucking piece of shit.</v>

2828
01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.590
<v Speaker 4>I opened my laptop at home</v>

2829
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.713
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>

2830
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:11.230
<v Speaker 6>there's my wifi and then there's the printer Wifi and it just goes to the</v>

2831
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:12.830
<v Speaker 6>printer Wifi.</v>

2832
01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.780
<v Speaker 6>I opened it up and I go to and it's just that having to go</v>

2833
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.650
<v Speaker 4>change it from the printer to the thing every time.</v>

2834
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Just forget that me,</v>

2835
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.223
<v Speaker 4>I might move.</v>

2836
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.160
<v Speaker 4>You should kill someone.</v>

2837
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.020
<v Speaker 4>I literally physically with the table like Oh,</v>

2838
01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:31.093
<v Speaker 4>anger.</v>

2839
01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.460
<v Speaker 4>But I mean the idea of even having a fingerprint sensor on your phone was so</v>

2840
01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:36.060
<v Speaker 4>sexy.</v>

2841
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Just a little while ago.</v>

2842
01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:38.430
<v Speaker 4>They came out with that.</v>

2843
01:18:38.431 --> 01:18:38.880
<v Speaker 4>With the.</v>

2844
01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Was this the first one?</v>

2845
01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:42.300
<v Speaker 4>I had the fingerprint sensor with the iphone or the last five?</v>

2846
01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:43.523
<v Speaker 4>Five.</v>

2847
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Five.</v>

2848
01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Five.</v>

2849
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 4>Like the upgraded five?</v>

2850
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2851
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:48.420
<v Speaker 4>I'd love the fingerprint sensor.</v>

2852
01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:51.900
<v Speaker 4>It is general that cops can force you to use the fingerprint sensor,</v>

2853
01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:54.450
<v Speaker 4>but they can't force you to enter in your,</v>

2854
01:18:54.451 --> 01:18:55.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2855
01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:55.973
<v Speaker 4>your code.</v>

2856
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2857
01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.810
<v Speaker 4>So have you ever get addressed,</v>

2858
01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.830
<v Speaker 4>arrested,</v>

2859
01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:00.330
<v Speaker 4>delete all of your fingerprints?</v>

2860
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:01.270
<v Speaker 6>I have a great tip.</v>

2861
01:19:01.271 --> 01:19:03.460
<v Speaker 6>I just found out that it's really scary.</v>

2862
01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:05.050
<v Speaker 6>Is that turn off?</v>

2863
01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.580
<v Speaker 6>Turn off this thing,</v>

2864
01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:06.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2865
01:19:06.761 --> 01:19:09.970
<v Speaker 6>like if you have your phone up and you go up like that,</v>

2866
01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 6>you can have like that quick menu shit.</v>

2867
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.210
<v Speaker 6>Like you lose your phone,</v>

2868
01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.140
<v Speaker 6>somebody picks it up,</v>

2869
01:19:14.141 --> 01:19:16.930
<v Speaker 6>they put it in airplane mode so you can't find your phone and they steal your</v>

2870
01:19:16.931 --> 01:19:17.261
<v Speaker 6>phone.</v>

2871
01:19:17.261 --> 01:19:21.580
<v Speaker 6>So there was no way for the find your phone app to find you.</v>

2872
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.180
<v Speaker 6>So you need to turn off this swipe up Mineo uh,</v>

2873
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.160
<v Speaker 6>because that's what they do.</v>

2874
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:28.750
<v Speaker 6>Like if you leave a phone in a taxi,</v>

2875
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.610
<v Speaker 6>the taxi guy goes up.</v>

2876
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.823
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2877
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>now he knows.</v>

2878
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Now that you're sharing this information with the terrorists.</v>

2879
01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

2880
01:19:37.661 --> 01:19:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

2881
01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

2882
01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:40.000
<v Speaker 4>that does make sense though.</v>

2883
01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:40.834
<v Speaker 4>They can't use the phone,</v>

2884
01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.330
<v Speaker 4>your phone because people have gotten their asses kicked from that.</v>

2885
01:19:43.331 --> 01:19:44.164
<v Speaker 4>Find your phone,</v>

2886
01:19:44.410 --> 01:19:44.960
<v Speaker 4>will you,</v>

2887
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.290
<v Speaker 4>you know someone stole your phone.</v>

2888
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.021
<v Speaker 4>You Ding Dong.</v>

2889
01:19:47.021 --> 01:19:47.411
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

2890
01:19:47.411 --> 01:19:48.244
<v Speaker 4>You have my phone.</v>

2891
01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:49.503
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

2892
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I got to find your phone APP.</v>

2893
01:19:52.031 --> 01:19:54.490
<v Speaker 4>You fuckhead they could only find the address.</v>

2894
01:19:54.491 --> 01:19:56.020
<v Speaker 4>They can't find like what room it's in.</v>

2895
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.180
<v Speaker 4>You have to tear someone's Goddamn House.</v>

2896
01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Go through the whole hotel.</v>

2897
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.760
<v Speaker 4>How accurate is it?</v>

2898
01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.860
<v Speaker 4>It's not like one of those.</v>

2899
01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:02.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2900
01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty on homing devices.</v>

2901
01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:05.340
<v Speaker 4>How motivated you phone?</v>

2902
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Like what if it's an apartment building in.</v>

2903
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty accurate</v>

2904
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:08.531
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2905
01:20:08.531 --> 01:20:09.390
<v Speaker 3>because I own my house.</v>

2906
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I can see exactly what room I'm in.</v>

2907
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 3>If I look at myself,</v>

2908
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>it does it.</v>

2909
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>What does it show you?</v>

2910
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It shows me the outline of my house in Google maps and then it shows me what</v>

2911
01:20:18.211 --> 01:20:20.970
<v Speaker 3>room I'm in this room.</v>

2912
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:21.481
<v Speaker 3>Your phone,</v>

2913
01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:21.820
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2914
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:22.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2915
01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I'll use that.</v>

2916
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if I can't find my phone,</v>

2917
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll go on my laptop and make it play a sound and I'll find my phone like,</v>

2918
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2919
01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 3>underneath the couch or something like that.</v>

2920
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

2921
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 3>So I could play a sound even if it's off.</v>

2922
01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2923
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Even if the sound the ringer's off.</v>

2924
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:37.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2926
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 3>There's also another app I recommend called secret,</v>

2927
01:20:40.951 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>which is another one that I put on all my phones and my laptops and stuff and</v>

2928
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:44.701
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

2929
01:20:44.701 --> 01:20:47.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a program that's always running that does the same kind of thing,</v>

2930
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.320
<v Speaker 3>but you could also turn on your Webcam and take photos.</v>

2931
01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 3>So if somebody stole your laptop,</v>

2932
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.210
<v Speaker 3>they won't even know that you're just sitting at filming them,</v>

2933
01:20:54.211 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 3>getting their gps,</v>

2934
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:59.750
<v Speaker 3>get every single key type that they type in or your girlfriend can put that shit</v>

2935
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.511
<v Speaker 3>on your phone and catch,</v>

2936
01:21:00.511 --> 01:21:01.344
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2937
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:04.440
<v Speaker 3>it always comes back to bite Ya.</v>

2938
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 3>My.</v>

2939
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I did the find your phone.</v>

2940
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:12.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like my friends or something to see where my daughter was and it's not that</v>

2941
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:13.050
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

2942
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 3>It's always like it said she was in a black neighborhood and that's just not.</v>

2943
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:16.741
<v Speaker 3>It can't be.</v>

2944
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:17.574
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2945
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.230
<v Speaker 3>That's just bad technology.</v>

2946
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I made no sense.</v>

2947
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Tell me,</v>

2948
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.023
<v Speaker 3>you were at school,</v>

2949
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:28.263
<v Speaker 3>you were at school.</v>

2950
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.410
<v Speaker 3>It's way more accurate if you're connected to a wifi network.</v>

2951
01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Like if she's not connected to a wifi network and it has to try to guess where</v>

2952
01:21:35.101 --> 01:21:35.934
<v Speaker 3>it's where it is,</v>

2953
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work on airplane mode.</v>

2954
01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:39.114
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2955
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:40.520
<v Speaker 3>That's weak.</v>

2956
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 3>They need to change that or they need to make it.</v>

2958
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:43.350
<v Speaker 3>So your thumbprint.</v>

2959
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.780
<v Speaker 3>If it's locked that menu.</v>

2960
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I love that swiping up thing.</v>

2961
01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:48.540
<v Speaker 3>They'll use the flashlight.</v>

2962
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I use the flashlight all the time.</v>

2963
01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I'm turning off that up swipe thing.</v>

2964
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2965
01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.250
<v Speaker 3>That's why it bumped things.</v>

2966
01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:53.791
<v Speaker 3>Pretty Dope.</v>

2967
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder if you could turn it off.</v>

2968
01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:57.300
<v Speaker 3>You know from the lock screen,</v>

2969
01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 3>like if it's on a lock screen,</v>

2970
01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I like to use a camera from that or just</v>

2971
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.443
<v Speaker 3>alarm.</v>

2972
01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2973
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.730
<v Speaker 3>there's things I can't do two steps.</v>

2974
01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:09.420
<v Speaker 3>God dammit can't handle that.</v>

2975
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 3>It's very busy.</v>

2976
01:22:10.651 --> 01:22:11.770
<v Speaker 3>You have a little day.</v>

2977
01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Take a little bit about.</v>

2978
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just things are constantly improving.</v>

2979
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly innovating and adding to them.</v>

2980
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:20.480
<v Speaker 3>And that sound thing that you see on that walk,</v>

2981
01:22:20.481 --> 01:22:20.760
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2982
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.120
<v Speaker 3>You'd be a silly person to buy that stupid $1,200 dollar walkman.</v>

2983
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2984
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Because that's going to be in your phone soon.</v>

2985
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:27.703
<v Speaker 3>That sort of.</v>

2986
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I know they're working on that.</v>

2987
01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:32.640
<v Speaker 3>They're working on improvements or I've read something about the digital cell</v>

2988
01:22:32.641 --> 01:22:36.420
<v Speaker 3>phones working on improvements of sound quality in anticipation of these types</v>

2989
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:37.254
<v Speaker 3>of devices.</v>

2990
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.200
<v Speaker 3>You know what I want them to do?</v>

2991
01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you use apple pay?</v>

2992
01:22:40.231 --> 01:22:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you use that brain wave?</v>

2993
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:42.163
<v Speaker 3>The phone.</v>

2994
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:43.420
<v Speaker 3>He's waving the phone and it pays.</v>

2995
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I want them to fix the a toll system at lax.</v>

2996
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 3>You ever get in the car after a Gig or whatever and then you like,</v>

2997
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:55.440
<v Speaker 3>there's that line and nobody has the thing and find the card and it just takes</v>

2998
01:22:55.441 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 3>me to get out of there.</v>

2999
01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me there's not going to be an APP and a waving of the phones.</v>

3000
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:02.610
<v Speaker 3>It's going to solve this problem.</v>

3001
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.400
<v Speaker 3>We should be out of here immediately.</v>

3002
01:23:04.401 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I remember when the fast pass in</v>

3003
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.890
<v Speaker 4>New York pass through and you could just drive through.</v>

3004
01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to pay the tolls.</v>

3005
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

3006
01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.340
<v Speaker 4>So excited.</v>

3007
01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 4>You just had to drive.</v>

3008
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 4>The main light went on.</v>

3009
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 4>You went right through.</v>

3010
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:20.970
<v Speaker 4>It saves so much fucking time and traffic's so much time because traffic in New</v>

3011
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.460
<v Speaker 4>York on toll booths used to be insanity.</v>

3012
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3013
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to fucking eat his shotgun.</v>

3014

3028
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't even pay my bills.</v>

3029
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Somebody else pays Mongo.</v>

3030
01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:55.933
<v Speaker 4>I don't even feel it.</v>

3031
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:59.170
<v Speaker 4>You have a business guy trying to get one of those.</v>

3032
01:23:59.250 --> 01:23:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Is it great?</v>

3033
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.491
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3034
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:01.780
<v Speaker 4>I just met a guy yesterday.</v>

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Well my guys,</v>

3036
01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 4>a good friend that I've had for a long time.</v>

3037
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:05.731
<v Speaker 4>You want to know the dude?</v>

3038
01:24:05.731 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 4>This guy knows he's worked with other good friends.</v>

3039
01:24:08.471 --> 01:24:09.304
<v Speaker 4>That helps.</v>

3040
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:10.503
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3041
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.120
<v Speaker 4>but it does make your life that much better.</v>

3042
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:13.361
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3043
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 4>most certainly does.</v>

3044
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:15.131
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3045
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 4>it's for everything too.</v>

3046
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to buy a house,</v>

3047
01:24:17.981 --> 01:24:19.270
<v Speaker 4>if you want to buy a car,</v>

3048
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:20.400
<v Speaker 4>if you need take,</v>

3049
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 4>take care of your bills.</v>

3050
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 4>They took care of everything.</v>

3051
01:24:22.721 --> 01:24:26.620
<v Speaker 4>They give you an itemized monthly report every week on your phone or every month</v>

3052
01:24:26.621 --> 01:24:28.930
<v Speaker 4>and finances and you don't have to worry.</v>

3053
01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:29.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to think about anything.</v>

3054
01:24:29.921 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

3055
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 4>We just downstairs a lot of time involved in being a human being.</v>

3056
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:37.330
<v Speaker 4>That takes away from work that you could be doing.</v>

3057
01:24:37.331 --> 01:24:39.160
<v Speaker 4>The ache actually makes you more money.</v>

3058
01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3059
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:40.211
<v Speaker 4>So when people say,</v>

3060
01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3061
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3062
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:43.240
<v Speaker 4>you're giving away x amount of percent of your income.</v>

3063
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3064
01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 4>but I'm making more money because I'm thinking more and I'm doing more sit in</v>

3065
01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:49.030
<v Speaker 4>front of my fucking computer.</v>

3066
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:50.800
<v Speaker 4>Paying bills for hours every night,</v>

3067
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:52.810
<v Speaker 4>writing checks,</v>

3068
01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.160
<v Speaker 4>track,</v>

3069
01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:53.741
<v Speaker 4>keep track.</v>

3070
01:24:53.741 --> 01:24:56.600
<v Speaker 4>And remember balancing a checkbook locked up.</v>

3071
01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Fuck John Ledger Ledger.</v>

3072
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.263
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3073
01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:03.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3074
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:03.881
<v Speaker 4>I'm so.</v>

3075
01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 4>I feel like so tapped out for time.</v>

3076
01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3077
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 4>I need a staff.</v>

3078
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:09.190
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3079
01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:09.581
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

3080
01:25:09.581 --> 01:25:14.060
<v Speaker 4>this seems like good for a spot where you're a comic and you have a family too.</v>

3081
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And so there's a lot of stuff.</v>

3082
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.690
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

3083
01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I have too many things going on for that.</v>

3084
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3085
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:20.171
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3086
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:21.004
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it.</v>

3087
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm broke.</v>

3088
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:24.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3089
01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:25.540
<v Speaker 4>listen.</v>

3090
01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Well that has happened to,</v>

3091
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:27.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3092
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 4>there have been guys that have been unscrupulous.</v>

3093
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 4>I remember there was a um,</v>

3094
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:35.560
<v Speaker 4>there was an issue way back in the day where there was an agent that was</v>

3095
01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 4>stealing money from a bunch of,</v>

3096
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 4>like big name clients,</v>

3097
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 4>like Lenny Clarke got hit stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from him and</v>

3098
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

3099
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3100
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:45.040
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

3101
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3102
01:25:45.221 --> 01:25:49.210
<v Speaker 4>There was an agency that was going on that was doing that for pe.</v>

3103
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:49.751
<v Speaker 4>I forget.</v>

3104
01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to ask lenny next time I see him.</v>

3105
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3106
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:55.630
<v Speaker 4>But it was devastating for a lot of these guys who'd lost just hundreds of</v>

3107
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:56.351
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars.</v>

3108
01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Somebody just Dane Cook's brother.</v>

3109
01:25:58.390 --> 01:26:00.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3110
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:01.421
<v Speaker 4>That was bad.</v>

3111
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:02.620
<v Speaker 4>That was really brutal.</v>

3112
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.493
<v Speaker 4>In jail.</v>

3113
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3114
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Imagine your brother is in jail for robbing you and they have never recovered</v>

3115
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>millions of that money.</v>

3116
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3117
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:12.950
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot that was owed to the irs to.</v>

3118
01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot o to the irs,</v>

3119
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also missing.</v>

3120
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.920
<v Speaker 1>One of his brothers stole money from him and went on a drive across the country</v>

3121
01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 1>and they don't know what the fuck he did when he was driving.</v>

3122
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 1>He could've stopped at banks and got security boxes under assumed names.</v>

3123
01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3124
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much is involved in getting a security box at a bank,</v>

3125
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but there might be shank.</v>

3126
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:35.371
<v Speaker 1>It's very deep.</v>

3127
01:26:35.371 --> 01:26:40.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean there might be fucking coffee cans somewhere under fence posts with a</v>

3128
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.563
<v Speaker 1>million dollars rolled up in it.</v>

3129
01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna find it.</v>

3130
01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3131
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen what a million dollars looks like in a bag of $100 bills?</v>

3132
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:49.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not as much as you would think it is.</v>

3133
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.091
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it.</v>

3134
01:26:50.091 --> 01:26:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a suitcase,</v>

3135
01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 1>like a small bag do is just dig a fucking hole.</v>

3136
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You throw that shit in there.</v>

3137
01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 1>We just got to be able to triangulate it on a gps and oh shit.</v>

3138
01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Actually get there and there's an apartment building where the spot was.</v>

3139
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.053
<v Speaker 1>Whereas</v>

3140
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>20 years in the big house,</v>

3141
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the big house,</v>

3142
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.000
<v Speaker 1>that's an awful story.</v>

3143
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:18.860
<v Speaker 1>What's fucked up because it was his brother too,</v>

3144
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and it was any found out after his parents passed.</v>

3145
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.390
<v Speaker 1>It was brutal.</v>

3146
01:27:23.391 --> 01:27:24.020
<v Speaker 1>He also,</v>

3147
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a half brother,</v>

3148
01:27:25.161 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 1>which he should be really careful of those little Fox brothers rather than</v>

3149
01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to pretend the brother.</v>

3150
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the other half lives?</v>

3151
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3152
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they have you fuck.</v>

3153
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.330
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3154
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 1>his brother apparently,</v>

3155
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.051

3175
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 1>So he started asking questions.</v>

3176
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:27:58.281 --> 01:27:59.091
<v Speaker 1>super nervous,</v>

3185

<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

3188
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and then he started to get it investigated.</v>

3189
01:28:03.171 --> 01:28:04.090
<v Speaker 1>And when you've got an investigator,</v>

3190
01:28:04.091 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 1>he realized his brother just fucking dealing.</v>

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:16.310
<v Speaker 1>he had work.</v>

3198
01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 1>He had money that was in plastic bags that was frozen in tomato sauce.</v>

3225
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3250
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.100
<v Speaker 4>I know people that don't even have managers,</v>

3251
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.210
<v Speaker 4>they just have an agent and they just do everything through their agent and have</v>

3252
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.360
<v Speaker 4>agents take care of everything.</v>

3253
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:45.571
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3254
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:46.860
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3255
01:29:46.861 --> 01:29:47.240
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3256
01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:47.451
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3257
01:29:47.451 --> 01:29:48.271
<v Speaker 4>like I'm saving money.</v>

3258
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:48.511
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3259
01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:48.871
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3260
01:29:48.871 --> 01:29:49.261
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

3261
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:51.330
<v Speaker 4>but you have to think about more stuff that way.</v>

3262
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3263
01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the.</v>

3264
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.450
<v Speaker 4>I know that's really,</v>

3265
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:55.284
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

3266
01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 4>It sucks up so much of your brain power just to have to go and do that stuff.</v>

3267
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.871
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

3268
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:04.140
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you think too much in the financial sense,</v>

3269
01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:05.280
<v Speaker 4>like how much am I making?</v>

3270
01:30:05.281 --> 01:30:06.270
<v Speaker 4>How much more can I make?</v>

3271
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.320
<v Speaker 4>I can get this out of them.</v>

3272
01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:07.711
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3273
01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:10.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to ask for that and hopefully I'll get like less.</v>

3274
01:30:10.951 --> 01:30:11.551
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3275
01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:12.450
<v Speaker 4>all overshoot,</v>

3276
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.160
<v Speaker 4>but if you,</v>

3277
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.510
<v Speaker 4>if you have all that kind of thinking going on in your head,</v>

3278
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that's contrary to creative thinking.</v>

3279
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 4>I think creative thinking is like non selfish,</v>

3280
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:23.090
<v Speaker 4>non aware.</v>

3281
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>

3282
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 4>when I think like creatively I'm empty.</v>

3283
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:28.410
<v Speaker 4>When I think it might sit in front of my computer.</v>

3284
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm not thinking about myself at all.</v>

3285
01:30:30.031 --> 01:30:31.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about the idea.</v>

3286
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm not thinking,</v>

3287
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

3288
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:34.200
<v Speaker 4>how much money can this idea make me?</v>

3289
01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3290
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.341
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3343
01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:09.550
<v Speaker 4>society and our educational system unavailable to us without such drugs.</v>

3344
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.230
<v Speaker 4>Carl motherfucking Sagan.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3446
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:42.260
<v Speaker 4>just an idea comes.</v>

3447
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3448
01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 4>And it just gets out of my head like in these big bursts and I feel like.</v>

3449
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:47.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3450
01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:50.530
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like you gotta you just gotTa capture those moments,</v>

3451
01:34:50.531 --> 01:34:50.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3452
01:34:50.681 --> 01:34:51.400
<v Speaker 4>you gotta figure.</v>

3453
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think it's very important for comics to be able to type.</v>

3454
01:34:54.191 --> 01:34:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a lot of comics can't they pack and poke and you miss out on them</v>

3455
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 4>ideas because you can't write.</v>

3456
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Can't grab them out of the air quicker now.</v>

3457
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3458
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever write longhand?</v>

3459
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3460
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.413
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do,</v>

3461
01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:08.170
<v Speaker 4>but when I write like it's like all this shit,</v>

3462
01:35:08.171 --> 01:35:12.340
<v Speaker 4>like during shows and stuff or have an idea that I don't want to forget their</v>

3463
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 4>most of what it is.</v>

3464
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:17.380
<v Speaker 4>It's just like really quick cliff notes or um,</v>

3465
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 4>when I have a,</v>

3466
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.110
<v Speaker 4>my notebook that I use for shows,</v>

3467
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 4>I just write the same things down over and over again.</v>

3468
01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at my notebook,</v>

3469
01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:28.440
<v Speaker 4>I'll look like a crazy person because I'm,</v>

3470
01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:32.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to remember the order and make sure that I get the key punch</v>

3471
01:35:32.041 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 4>lines,</v>

3472
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 4>especially on new stuff.</v>

3473
01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like the shining page after page of the same stuff.</v>

3474
01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:40.940
<v Speaker 4>It's weird to use notes on your iphone.</v>

3475
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3476
01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:42.460

3477
01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.100
<v Speaker 4>What is it called?</v>

3478
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:45.380
<v Speaker 4>Mine's called Bunny.</v>

3479
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3480
01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:46.180
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3481
01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 4>it's just notes,</v>

3482
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:47.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3483
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:49.160
<v Speaker 4>just this little notepad thing.</v>

3484
01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Like I've got one here that I had to write yesterday,</v>

3485
01:35:51.970 --> 01:35:55.840
<v Speaker 4>but racial profiling and yeah,</v>

3486
01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of them,</v>

3487
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:57.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3488
01:35:57.190 --> 01:35:58.880
<v Speaker 4>these are all things that are just written down.</v>

3489
01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:58.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3490
01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.813
<v Speaker 4>they're all random.</v>

3491
01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Put them all in one file.</v>

3492
01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:01.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3493
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 4>do I put them all under funny and it's a very low percentage of what actually</v>

3494
01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:06.440
<v Speaker 4>gets turned into a joke.</v>

3495
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3496
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 4>But it's like you gotta throw a lot of shit up against the wall.</v>

3497
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Do you record your sets?</v>

3498
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:11.150

<v Speaker 4>I record,</v>

3501
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I used to use this voice memos thing that comes with the iphone,</v>

3502
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.020
<v Speaker 4>but I found that it crashed a couple of times.</v>

3503
01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.040
<v Speaker 4>Fucked me and it's not good when you're listened to it and go over stuff.</v>

3504
01:36:22.041 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I'll use this one.</v>

3505

01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:15.000
<v Speaker 1>They take that sawdust and they compress it and the natural sugars just in</v>

3730
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 1>compressing it,</v>

3731
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:17.720
<v Speaker 1>make these things stick together and,</v>

3732
01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 1>and the pellets and you could take the pellets.</v>

3733
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 1>You kinda break them in your hand.</v>

3734
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:21.480
<v Speaker 1>They're not like,</v>

3735
01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a hard piece of wood,</v>

3736
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but it is a hardwood.</v>

3737
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you take these pellets,</v>

3738
01:43:26.491 --> 01:43:29.260
<v Speaker 1>he put them into this bucket and it's super efficient.</v>

3739
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Just like a small box,</v>

3740
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3741
01:43:32.171 --> 01:43:37.171
<v Speaker 1>like maybe two foot square of these will last for fucking hours and hours of</v>

3742
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:38.770
<v Speaker 1>cooking really.</v>

3743
01:43:38.771 --> 01:43:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And it regulates the temperature perfectly and you can grill on it.</v>

3744
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It works as a smoker.</v>

3745
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:47.940
<v Speaker 1>You can slow cook food on it and you could load every time you grill.</v>

3746
01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3747
01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:49.391
<v Speaker 1>it's loaded.</v>

3748
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It's loaded for like out.</v>

3749
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:53.870
<v Speaker 1>It's loaded for hours and hours of cooking and then when you want more you just</v>

3750
01:43:53.871 --> 01:43:54.704
<v Speaker 1>pour some more</v>

3751
01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:55.321
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

3752
01:43:55.321 --> 01:43:56.470
<v Speaker 3>So you put a state guidelines.</v>

3753
01:43:56.471 --> 01:43:57.304
<v Speaker 3>If you heat it up,</v>

3754
01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.590
<v Speaker 3>shut it off and you turn it back on again and it takes a couple minutes.</v>

3755
01:44:01.591 --> 01:44:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It kicks on and heats up really quickly.</v>

3756
01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Tastes delicious.</v>

3757
01:44:05.071 --> 01:44:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I love cooking.</v>

3758
01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>They have an app now that you can just tell you how,</v>

3759
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.100
<v Speaker 3>what your,</v>

3760
01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.060
<v Speaker 3>your temperature is.</v>

3761
01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Do it from your phone.</v>

3762
01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.730
<v Speaker 3>They also have other thing that you plug into your,</v>

3763
01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.631
<v Speaker 3>into the meat,</v>

3764
01:44:15.631 --> 01:44:19.050
<v Speaker 3>like a meat thermometer and it registers on the thing so you could tell exactly</v>

3765
01:44:19.051 --> 01:44:20.850
<v Speaker 3>what temperature your food is when it's done.</v>

3766
01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3767
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Green mountain girls is the best.</v>

3768
01:44:22.890 --> 01:44:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

3769
01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It's all gas at the Papa House.</v>

3770
01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Use Gas grills festival doesn't taste as good.</v>

3771
01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I generally,</v>

3772
01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I like it</v>

3773
01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:33.060
<v Speaker 1>to grill on lump charcoal,</v>

3774
01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to slow cook things and smoke things on the,</v>

3775
01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.570
<v Speaker 1>on the Green Mountain Grill.</v>

3776
01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 3>What's really not good as the,</v>

3777
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:41.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3778
01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 3>the lid of my grill is the paint spin.</v>

3779
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:44.663
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

3780
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:46.620
<v Speaker 3>this thing just happened to me.</v>

3781
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that for a couple of years.</v>

3782
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Not that the black stuff would fall on your chicken and your don't know if it's</v>

3783
01:44:53.491 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 3>just a grind or you don't know.</v>

3784
01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Let's check into that for like two years before Green Mountain girl sent me one.</v>

3785
01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you need to get a better grip?</v>

3786
01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's get new grill.</v>

3787
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:01.471
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

3788
01:45:01.471 --> 01:45:02.660
<v Speaker 3>You guys should get groups together.</v>

3789
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:04.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3790
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:06.263
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

3791
01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what a big green egg is?</v>

3792
01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3793
01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that's like a ceramic grill.</v>

3794
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:12.541
<v Speaker 1>It's got like,</v>

3795
01:45:12.541 --> 01:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>it's really heavy and the ceramic,</v>

3796
01:45:14.161 --> 01:45:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's made as ceramic,</v>

3797
01:45:15.571 --> 01:45:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it keeps in the heat and a lot of people like smoke things and cook things that</v>

3798
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I use it mostly to grill,</v>

3799
01:45:21.090 --> 01:45:22.260
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have a big green egg.</v>

3800
01:45:22.261 --> 01:45:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I have a better one.</v>

3801
01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:24.160
<v Speaker 1>It's called a Kamado.</v>

3802
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really beautiful.</v>

3803
01:45:25.021 --> 01:45:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's big beautiful Japanese thing with blue tiles on it.</v>

3804
01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:29.370
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3805
01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I use that for grilling real stakes on it.</v>

3806
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:33.720
<v Speaker 1>But anything that I want to slow cook,</v>

3807
01:45:33.721 --> 01:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>like the other day I did a roast on the green mountain grill.</v>

3808
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Lovely.</v>

3809
01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:38.740
<v Speaker 3>That sounds good.</v>

3810
01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:39.041
<v Speaker 3>Photos.</v>

3811
01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Always lovely as I'm eating lean pockets.</v>

3812
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I did my first Moose roast the other day.</v>

3813
01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Where did you get shot?</v>

3814
01:45:48.251 --> 01:45:48.880
<v Speaker 3>That bitch.</v>

3815
01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Where the fuck it is right there.</v>

3816
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I got it in studio city.</v>

3817
01:45:54.601 --> 01:45:57.160
<v Speaker 3>It was talking shit about him at the winter.</v>

3818
01:45:57.230 --> 01:45:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Drive talking shit about Mexicans.</v>

3819
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:00.163
<v Speaker 3>Take it out.</v>

3820
01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:01.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3821
01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I shot it in Canada.</v>

3822
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

3823
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Moose hunting is like,</v>

3824
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:06.480
<v Speaker 1>like the top of the hunting.</v>

3825
01:46:06.690 --> 01:46:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Well it's delicious meat and you can get a moose and it'll last you.</v>

3826
01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have 400 pounds of Moose meat in my freezer.</v>

3827
01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:14.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3828
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Give or take a couple of pounds.</v>

3829
01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 3>His face right there.</v>

3830
01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:18.021
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3831
01:46:18.021 --> 01:46:18.560
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3832
01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.071
<v Speaker 3>That's his head,</v>

3833
01:46:19.071 --> 01:46:19.904
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3834
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:20.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3835
01:46:20.131 --> 01:46:20.340
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

3836
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.540
<v Speaker 1>was the moose fellow.</v>

3837
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:24.643
<v Speaker 1>He looks.</v>

3838
01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He's really lean right now.</v>

3839
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Books for 400 pounds.</v>

3840
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:33.340
<v Speaker 1>So it was a 900 pound animal.</v>

3841
01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Debone it and skin it and cut all the meat out.</v>

3842
01:46:36.361 --> 01:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of meat.</v>

3843
01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like 400 meals.</v>

3844
01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it really gave me or no,</v>

3845
01:46:41.911 --> 01:46:42.660
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

3846
01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:43.493
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even.</v>

3847
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:44.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3848
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Moose is like a very unique flavor.</v>

3849
01:46:47.130 --> 01:46:47.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3850
01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and even deer,</v>

3851
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:54.000
<v Speaker 1>good percentage of like diy or like what makes it gave me is the preparation.</v>

3852
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's how people,</v>

3853
01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:56.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3854
01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 1>take care of the meat.</v>

3855
01:46:57.470 --> 01:47:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Like glands are really important.</v>

3856
01:47:00.031 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 1>You avoid like they have these things called tarsal glands that like a down near</v>

3857
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 1>their legs and when they're in heat,</v>

3858
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.160
<v Speaker 1>which is most of the time when people hunt them what it's called,</v>

3859
01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:09.023
<v Speaker 1>the Rut.</v>

3860
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3861
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that's when hunting season is legal in a lot of states.</v>

3862
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:15.600
<v Speaker 1>If you get that stuff on the meat,</v>

3863
01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

3864
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it'll fuck with the taste of the meat.</v>

3865
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:18.391
<v Speaker 1>I get strong.</v>

3866
01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:18.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3867
01:47:18.661 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>

3868
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:19.711
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

3869
01:47:19.711 --> 01:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3870
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:25.070
<v Speaker 1>if it decomposes or if you let it sit in the sun too long while you're gutting</v>

3871
01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3872
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not good to me.</v>

3873
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You can go bad if the organs get too hot while you're.</v>

3874
01:47:30.090 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 1>While you're taking care of it.</v>

3875
01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different variables like the fat itself.</v>

3876
01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You got to trim the fat off of a dearest guide through all this.</v>

3877
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:40.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Steve Rinella,</v>

3878
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 1>he has a show called mediator,</v>

3881
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:49.020
<v Speaker 1>He took me on my first hunt and then I started going hunting with a bunch of</v>

3882
01:47:49.021 --> 01:47:52.530
<v Speaker 1>different people ever since then for the last two years,</v>

3883
01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.690
<v Speaker 1>which just get excited about.</v>

3884
01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:54.860
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3885
01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:57.140
<v Speaker 6>I was looking up because fog rock</v>

3886
01:47:58.670 --> 01:47:59.331
<v Speaker 6>has been.</v>

3887
01:47:59.331 --> 01:48:03.560
<v Speaker 6>The band has been overturned here in Los Angeles and I was just looking to see</v>

3888
01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:05.660
<v Speaker 6>what restaurants have it and one of my favorite restaurants,</v>

3889
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.480
<v Speaker 6>they announced that they carry it.</v>

3890
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Do animal this.</v>

3891
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a place right down the street here,</v>

3892
01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:13.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3893
01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Like in the next town over.</v>

3894
01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>It's called brandywine is fucking amazing.</v>

3895
01:48:17.801 --> 01:48:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It's on Ventura Boulevard.</v>

3896
01:48:19.181 --> 01:48:20.700
<v Speaker 1>They have the best Fagua.</v>

3897
01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3898
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And people who don't like,</v>

3899
01:48:22.601 --> 01:48:23.470
<v Speaker 1>fuck Fagua Oh,</v>

3900
01:48:23.471 --> 01:48:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>

3901
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Why would you eat duck liver?</v>

3902
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3903
01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.300
<v Speaker 1>why would you duck</v>

3904
01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.570
<v Speaker 1>asshole here?</v>

3905
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Overfeeding those ducks is that worst and shoot him in the fucking face because</v>

3906
01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:38.880
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going to happen to cutting his head off and pluck and all his</v>

3907
01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:39.580
<v Speaker 1>feathers out.</v>

3908
01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:41.380
<v Speaker 6>What's the humane way that they,</v>

3909
01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:42.910
<v Speaker 6>I guess now are doing.</v>

3910
01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.620
<v Speaker 6>Is it just like a,</v>

3911
01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate about whether or not it's humane to create fog and in</v>

3912
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the all objectively speaking,</v>

3913
01:48:51.561 --> 01:48:55.670
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of fucked up that you take this duck and you stick his mouth into a</v>

3914
01:48:55.671 --> 01:48:58.580
<v Speaker 1>tube and then you force feed them and that's what makes their liver swell.</v>

3915
01:48:58.940 --> 01:48:59.773
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3916
01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the reality is when you go to these places where they have these farms,</v>

3917
01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:06.710
<v Speaker 1>when it's time for the ducks to feed,</v>

3918
01:49:06.711 --> 01:49:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they all get close to that feeder.</v>

3919
01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.300
<v Speaker 1>They want that food,</v>

3920
01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:11.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3921
01:49:11.841 --> 01:49:15.320
<v Speaker 1>they probably don't want you to grab them roughly and stick their neck on it,</v>

3922
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:20.120
<v Speaker 1>but the the best way to do it is to not force feed them the best way to do it,</v>

3923
01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:22.160
<v Speaker 1>as to give them an abundance of food,</v>

3924
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:26.300
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get a smaller liver than if you just pour it down their</v>

3925
01:49:26.301 --> 01:49:26.960
<v Speaker 1>throat.</v>

3926
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.793
<v Speaker 1>I've never had it.</v>

3927
01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.120
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have the same.</v>

3928
01:49:29.150 --> 01:49:31.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't have gag reflexes like we do.</v>

3929
01:49:31.401 --> 01:49:31.731
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3930
01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:32.564
<v Speaker 1>It's not like.</v>

3931
01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3932
01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they don't like being grabbed and have their mouse stuck into a tube,</v>

3933
01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:38.870
<v Speaker 1>but they also don't like being killed now.</v>

3934
01:49:38.871 --> 01:49:43.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no humane if there's no nice way to kill and eat meat.</v>

3935
01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Well is a humane way to treat them while they're alive and that's where the</v>

3936
01:49:46.281 --> 01:49:47.114
<v Speaker 1>debate live.</v>

3937
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:51.580
<v Speaker 1>But when the animal rights people passed that legislation,</v>

3938
01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:56.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean you kinda realized like the agenda of like Peta and animal rights people,</v>

3939
01:49:56.591 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't even want you eating eggs.</v>

3940
01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you know pete on their website has eggs listed to as a chicken's period?</v>

3941
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want to eat a chicken?</v>

3942
01:50:05.670 --> 01:50:06.100

<v Speaker 1>it's so hilarious.</v>

3948
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:10.743
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>

3949
01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you this from personal experience because I have chickens.</v>

3950
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:15.970

<v Speaker 1>That was kind of interesting.</v>

4045
01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:32.243
<v Speaker 1>It was delicious.</v>

4046
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:32.761
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty good.</v>

4047
01:52:32.761 --> 01:52:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4048
01:52:32.851 --> 01:52:37.500
<v Speaker 1>You like sear it on a frying pan and then you cook it over like 400 degree</v>

4049
01:52:37.501 --> 01:52:38.130
<v Speaker 1>temperature for,</v>

4057
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>California to appeal ruling overturning fog band.</v>

4058
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:48.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4059
01:52:48.501 --> 01:52:49.530

01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I am upset.</v>

4062
01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:55.943
<v Speaker 1>What are they saying?</v>

4063
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:57.280
<v Speaker 1>What are they saying?</v>

4064
01:52:57.281 --> 01:52:58.520
<v Speaker 1>A little scroll up.</v>

4065
01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.880
<v Speaker 1>What is this dummy setting?</v>

4066
01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 1>California California's attorney general on Wednesday filed.</v>

4067
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:07.961
<v Speaker 1>Notice that her office Twat will appeal of federal judges decision that</v>

4068
01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:10.010
<v Speaker 1>overturned the states.</v>

4069
01:53:10.011 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Two year ban on sales of fog was a delicacy made from fatty duck and geese</v>

4070
01:53:14.661 --> 01:53:15.170
<v Speaker 1>liver,</v>

4071
01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 1>California outlawed fog was sales and production in 2004,</v>

4072
01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but for really abandoned place take,</v>

4073
01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:25.640
<v Speaker 1>take place until 2012 proponents of the band say,</v>

4074
01:53:25.641 --> 01:53:28.160
<v Speaker 1>force feeding of ducks and geese to enlarge their livers,</v>

4075
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 1>amount to animal cruelty.</v>

4076
01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Critics of the band say it infringes upon culinary freedom.</v>

4077
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Effectively turning chefs into criminals.</v>

4078
01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:37.513
<v Speaker 1>Silly,</v>

4079
01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:38.061
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>

4080
01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:38.451
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>

4081
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:39.284
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

4082
01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this questionable ruling.</v>

4083
01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:48.080
<v Speaker 1>California has the right to prevent the commerce in such a cruel and inhumane</v>

4084
01:53:48.081 --> 01:53:48.914
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

4085
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 1>All meat products are cruel,</v>

4086
01:53:51.231 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 1>inhumane.</v>

4087
01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to go through every fucking single taco bell and take out</v>

4088
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:57.500
<v Speaker 1>all their beef,</v>

4089
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:58.520
<v Speaker 1>all the pork,</v>

4090
01:53:58.530 --> 01:53:59.600
<v Speaker 1>all their chicken,</v>

4091
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.190
<v Speaker 1>every burger king,</v>

4092
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 1>every Mcdonald's,</v>

4093
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>every KFC.</v>

4094
01:54:03.321 --> 01:54:08.321
<v Speaker 1>That is all animals that are treated far more cruel than these expensive duck</v>

4095
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and geese that.</v>

4096
01:54:11.190 --> 01:54:11.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

4097
01:54:11.771 --> 01:54:13.580
<v Speaker 1>they treat those betters factory.</v>

4098
01:54:13.650 --> 01:54:15.650
<v Speaker 1>All they're doing is feeding them a lot of,</v>

4099
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:17.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of grain.</v>

4100
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.930
<v Speaker 1>That's all they're doing.</v>

4101
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

4102
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4103
01:54:19.551 --> 01:54:24.551
<v Speaker 1>this idea that this is like a uniquely cruel thing and then if you ban this,</v>

4104
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that you see are not as bad.</v>

4105
01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:27.711
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4106
01:54:27.711 --> 01:54:29.690
<v Speaker 1>All the other things you see are way worse.</v>

4107
01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4108
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 1>they cut chickens,</v>

4109
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 1>beaks off when they're babies so that they don't peck each other's eyeballs off</v>

4110
01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:37.520
<v Speaker 1>because they're in such close quarters,</v>

4111
01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 1>stuffed into these little cages.</v>

4112
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.340
<v Speaker 1>That's all legal.</v>

4113
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 1>If they want to make something,</v>

4114
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.180
<v Speaker 1>what they should do is have everything free range.</v>

4115
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.021
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be free.</v>

4116
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Range pork should be free.</v>

4117
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Range chicken should be free.</v>

4118
01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Range beef should be free range.</v>

4119
01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You should have an allotted amount of land that you have to own for a certain</v>

4120
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:54.651
<v Speaker 1>amount of chickens,</v>

4121
01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:55.700
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of cows,</v>

4122
01:54:55.701 --> 01:54:56.534
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of beef,</v>

4123
01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.560
<v Speaker 1>but then you're going to have problems with coyotes because I have.</v>

4124
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I have a coyote,</v>

4125
01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I've had two chickens get killed by coyotes and one by my dog.</v>

4126
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So fucking man,</v>

4127
01:55:05.511 --> 01:55:05.800
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4128
01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 1>it looked.</v>

4129
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:06.820
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

4130
01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They find a way to get to them and if you have a big farm,</v>

4131
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:14.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to have sheep dogs that run around or some sort of dog that</v>

4132
01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 1>keeps the coyotes away.</v>

4133
01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:16.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4134
01:55:16.311 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to change agriculture.</v>

4135
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You have to change lives to it at that level,</v>

4136
01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.613
<v Speaker 1>that mass.</v>

4137
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:25.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to stop animal cruelty when it comes to livestock.</v>

4138
01:55:25.071 --> 01:55:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't do that,</v>

4139
01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.110
<v Speaker 1>then they're hypocritical.</v>

4140
01:55:27.111 --> 01:55:27.950
<v Speaker 1>This is silliness.</v>

4141
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 1>This is so many food.</v>

4142
01:55:29.451 --> 01:55:29.631
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4143
01:55:29.631 --> 01:55:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4144
01:55:29.991 --> 01:55:32.990
<v Speaker 1>The only force feeding them in such a small scale compared to.</v>

4145
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's delicious.</v>

4146
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

4147
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:36.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Talking to the real people.</v>

4212
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:09.564
<v Speaker 2>It was fine.</v>

4213
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 2>It was trying to do a comedy show with celebrities that weren't funny</v>

4214
01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.830
<v Speaker 2>staring into the eyes of Donald Trump or gloria,</v>

4215
01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:20.570
<v Speaker 2>stefan.</v>

4216
01:57:20.570 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4217
01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:23.940
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get some funny conversation going.</v>

4218
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.451
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

4219
01:57:24.451 --> 01:57:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I could talk to regular people about their relationships all night and day.</v>

4220
01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:30.690
<v Speaker 2>What was and have fun and interesting.</v>

4221
01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.321
<v Speaker 2>What was the bay?</v>

4222
01:57:31.321 --> 01:57:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

4223
01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:32.693
<v Speaker 2>I never saw it.</v>

4224
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:33.181
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

4225
01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:33.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4226
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4227
01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>it was a good core idea of Seinfeld's that when married couples get in fights,</v>

4228
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the fights will last forever because you know,</v>

4229
01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you both,</v>

4230
01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.190
<v Speaker 2>you're not really giving in and solving the problem.</v>

4231
01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:47.760
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of hunker down.</v>

4232
01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.230
<v Speaker 2>But if you have a friend,</v>

4233
01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you can happened with him.</v>

4234
01:57:50.701 --> 01:57:50.910
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4235
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:54.330
<v Speaker 2>him and his wife were in a fight and he had a friend over and he said,</v>

4236
01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Jerry said to him,</v>

4237
01:57:55.590 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 2>will you please listen to both sides and you tell us who's right and who's</v>

4238
01:57:58.861 --> 01:57:59.340
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

4239
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.130
<v Speaker 2>and the friend listen to and it says you were right and she's wrong,</v>

4240
01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:02.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4241
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And he thought this was a funny thing for a show for married couples.</v>

4242
01:58:05.881 --> 01:58:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Have there you have these fights at last,</v>

4243
01:58:06.991 --> 01:58:11.991
<v Speaker 2>their whole marriage have a marriage ref weigh in and say whether it's right or</v>

4244
01:58:13.231 --> 01:58:14.730
<v Speaker 2>wrong and uh,</v>

4245
01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 2>it's at its core,</v>

4246
01:58:16.831 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like a pretty good idea.</v>

4247
01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:19.440
<v Speaker 2>But then there's so many moving.</v>

4248
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.890
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

4249
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:20.760
<v Speaker 2>part reality.</v>

4250
01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:21.960
<v Speaker 2>There was a talk show.</v>

4251
01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Then you had three celebrities weighing in and giving their opinion on it.</v>

4252
01:58:25.621 --> 01:58:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And then it just became too many moving parts.</v>

4253
01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Celebrities are goofy idea.</v>

4254
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4255
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 4>Because especially like a lot of celebrities will pretend they have an opinion</v>

4256
01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:39.640
<v Speaker 4>that's different than they really have just in order to be like,</v>

4257
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 4>to get Brownie points sort of sound like it's the right thing to say.</v>

4258
01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:44.531
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4259
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Or just to</v>

4260
01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:46.430
<v Speaker 2>make noise on TV,</v>

4261
01:58:46.431 --> 01:58:48.020
<v Speaker 2>just to be saying something.</v>

4262
01:58:48.021 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 2>And then it became a booking nightmare because the,</v>

4263
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it went through Jerry's Rolodex at first it was like all these really famous</v>

4264
01:58:56.150 --> 01:59:00.800
<v Speaker 2>fund people that he knew like how Baldwin and Larry David and Madonna and all</v>

4265
01:59:00.801 --> 01:59:01.634
<v Speaker 2>these crazy people.</v>

4266
01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.460
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

4267
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.550
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4268
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:07.040
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going to just keep asking friends and stuff.</v>

4269
01:59:07.041 --> 01:59:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And then the next year it was like the level of went to Helen.</v>

4270
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:11.973
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

4271
01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:12.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4272
01:59:12.531 --> 01:59:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't get those kinds of.</v>

4273
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:16.340
<v Speaker 2>The network wanted Madonna every week and you know,</v>

4274
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you're getting some road comic or something like I'm in.</v>

4275
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:24.270
<v Speaker 4>That part became Kinda wiggy yeah.</v>

4276
01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 4>Counting on celebrity guests.</v>

4277
01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:28.510
<v Speaker 4>It's rough.</v>

4278
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Like celebrity apprentice.</v>

4279
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:30.970
<v Speaker 4>How long can they do that?</v>

4280
01:59:30.971 --> 01:59:31.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4281
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:32.710
<v Speaker 4>they're totally out of celebrities,</v>

4282
01:59:32.711 --> 01:59:33.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4283

4286
01:59:35.771 --> 01:59:40.000
<v Speaker 4>The other night I've looked at the billboard on Laurel and I don't know who any</v>

4287
01:59:40.001 --> 01:59:40.834

4288
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:45.460
<v Speaker 4>They offered that shit to me when I was,</v>

4289
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 4>when we were rebooting fear factor.</v>

01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:54.330
<v Speaker 4>And then I,</v>

4298
01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:54.690
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

4299
01:59:54.690 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 4>I talked to my wife and I'm like,</v>

4300
01:59:55.781 --> 01:59:57.330
<v Speaker 4>it might be fun to be in New York for what?</v>

4301
01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I can fucking just go to New York.</v>

4302
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be on this stupid fucking show and have him say yo fired.</v>

4303
02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:04.563
<v Speaker 4>Is the money,</v>

4304
02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 4>is the money so good.</v>

4305
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 4>That's why they get these people.</v>

4306
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:08.370
<v Speaker 4>They offer good money.</v>

4307
02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:09.000
<v Speaker 4>It is good.</v>

4308
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 4>It was a good chunk of change.</v>

4309
02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:11.351
<v Speaker 4>It was real money.</v>

4310
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:12.190
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of surprised.</v>

4311
02:00:12.970 --> 02:00:13.500
<v Speaker 4>It has.</v>

4312
02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:14.740
<v Speaker 4>It's been around forever.</v>

4313
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:17.800
<v Speaker 4>You have for two months they were going to give you like a real fucking,</v>

4314
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 4>a big slice,</v>

4315
02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:21.510
<v Speaker 4>a nice slice hat.</v>

4316
02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:22.361
<v Speaker 4>That's the only way.</v>

4317
02:00:22.361 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

4318
02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4319
02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.320
<v Speaker 4>it's still not worth not worth it because you're going to be stuck there and</v>

4320
02:00:27.330 --> 02:00:28.360
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to do that.</v>

4321
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:32.260
<v Speaker 4>But for people that are trying to like really like I know Penn Jillette,</v>

4322
02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.570
<v Speaker 4>he found that when he did it,</v>

4323
02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:35.920
<v Speaker 4>like all these people,</v>

4324
02:00:35.921 --> 02:00:39.310
<v Speaker 4>like they got more people to the show at the Rio really.</v>

4325
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:39.791
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4326
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:40.900
<v Speaker 4>they have a weekly show.</v>

4327
02:00:40.901 --> 02:00:41.860
<v Speaker 4>They're there every week.</v>

4328
02:00:41.861 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Penn and teller at the Rio in Vegas every week,</v>

4329
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:48.190
<v Speaker 4>every week and he kind of has to do things outside of that in order to alert</v>

4330
02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:52.000
<v Speaker 4>people that are there and he said it was very effective for that.</v>

4331
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4332
02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

4333
02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's just a personal thing,</v>

4334
02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:59.731
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't sit and look at Donald trump and I just fired jetson that big</v>

4335
02:01:01.991 --> 02:01:02.840
<v Speaker 4>face and that</v>

4336
02:01:04.530 --> 02:01:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>

4337
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.280
<v Speaker 4>but the marriage with was.</v>

4338
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.150
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

4339
02:01:07.150 --> 02:01:07.871
<v Speaker 4>it was okay.</v>

4340
02:01:07.871 --> 02:01:08.770
<v Speaker 4>It was just chaos.</v>

4341
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:11.560
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy producer and it's crazy producer.</v>

4342
02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 4>Those are great.</v>

4343
02:01:13.290 --> 02:01:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Wishes are great or not so stupid ideas that you have to listen to.</v>

4344
02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:21.670
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy fighting with the network and all this and saying,</v>

4345
02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:21.940
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:22.660
<v Speaker 4>what did the network?</v>

4347
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.090
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be like this nice little.</v>

4348
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I show Jerry wanted to do this little kid who's going to be like a Sunday night</v>

02:01:32.641 --> 02:01:33.474
<v Speaker 2>that's all it was.</v>

4352
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:38.750
<v Speaker 2>And then Leno's primetime tanked and they called Jerry and they were like,</v>

4360
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 2>when they had the final ceremonies for the Olympics,</v>

4361
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.210
<v Speaker 2>they cut it off.</v>

4362
02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Someone was in like mid singing made Canadian song and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is not what you told us.</v>

4368
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>This is not the best comedy thing of all time.</v>

4369
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And they really came after it too much,</v>

4370
02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:26.290
<v Speaker 2>way too much.</v>

4371
02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:29.520
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even know we were doing it.</v>

4372
02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:30.850
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what it was yet.</v>

4373
02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4374
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>you got to let those things grow.</v>

4375
02:02:32.501 --> 02:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4376
02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

4377
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:35.050
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about with jokes,</v>

4378
02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:35.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4379
02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.270

4380
02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:40.233
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

4381
02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.650
<v Speaker 2>It was so annoying.</v>

4382
02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I would watch the Olympics and be like,</v>

4383
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.910
<v Speaker 2>well I can't watch enough of these promos.</v>

4385
02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Letterman did a thing,</v>

4386
02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:50.620
<v Speaker 2>one of his top tens.</v>

4387
02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.011
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

4388
02:02:51.011 --> 02:02:51.561
<v Speaker 2>that was the year,</v>

4389
02:02:51.561 --> 02:02:52.420
<v Speaker 2>like someone went off,</v>

4390
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.220

4392
02:02:56.951 --> 02:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

4393
02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and it was like the top 10 things that he thought right before he crashed or</v>

4394
02:03:00.551 --> 02:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

4395
02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And one was no more marriage prep promos or something.</v>

4396
02:03:05.490 --> 02:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Did someone die?</v>

4397
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:07.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4398
02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was the dead guy.</v>

4399
02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4400
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't have done a top 10 off the dead guy.</v>

4401
02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.890
<v Speaker 2>He might've maybe depending on where his life was at at that moment.</v>

4402
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4403
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

4404
02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>

4405
02:03:17.110 --> 02:03:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4406
02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of get swept into those things and just,</v>

4407
02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>it was fun to have a show for a couple of years.</v>

4408
02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to do something else now?</v>

4409
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing that for?</v>

4410
02:03:25.151 --> 02:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

4411
02:03:25.930 --> 02:03:26.763
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

4412
02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:27.753
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

4413
02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm acting on the nick.</v>

4414
02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of episodes coming against the nick.</v>

4415
02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Nick is soderbergh's new show with Clive Owen.</v>

4416
02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>It's about a hospital in,</v>

4417
02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4418
02:03:36.970 --> 02:03:40.000
<v Speaker 2>in New York in 1910 and uh,</v>

4419
02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

4420
02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Is it a comedy or is it a drama?</v>

4421
02:03:44.031 --> 02:03:45.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a drama and uh,</v>

4422
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>he's Clive Owen's May.</v>

4423
02:03:47.630 --> 02:03:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

4424
02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:48.651
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

4425
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:49.431
<v Speaker 2>really well done.</v>

4426
02:03:49.431 --> 02:03:50.030
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

4427
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>

4428
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4429
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:52.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

4430
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Modern medicine had to start somewhere and soderbergh does it,</v>

4431
02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:56.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4432
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:58.070
<v Speaker 2>do a lot of stuff with soderbergh.</v>

4433
02:03:58.310 --> 02:04:02.720
<v Speaker 2>That really looks to me like that scene in that movie.</v>

4434
02:04:02.721 --> 02:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>The wolf man,</v>

4435
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:05.360
<v Speaker 2>the most recent one with.</v>

4436

<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is his name?</v>

4437
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:07.663

<v Speaker 3>That's pretty dope.</v>

4600
02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:24.970
<v Speaker 3>The last one we just were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>let's use it.</v>

4607
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's make it like show business like we made.</v>

4608
02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:32.410
<v Speaker 3>We blew the whole thing out.</v>

4609
02:08:33.330 --> 02:08:33.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4610
02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:35.230

4612
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:37.600
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a game show.</v>

4613
02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 3>It was called freaked out.</v>

4614
02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:39.790

4616
02:08:40.631 --> 02:08:40.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4617
02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:42.190
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like literally,</v>

4618
02:08:42.191 --> 02:08:44.600
<v Speaker 3>like it's all bright and white.</v>

4619
02:08:44.610 --> 02:08:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Mike and yeah,</v>

4620
02:08:46.331 --> 02:08:46.810
<v Speaker 3>we just made.</v>

02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:48.040
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to make like films,</v>

4622
02:08:48.041 --> 02:08:49.270
<v Speaker 3>like be creative with it.</v>

4623
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Netflix is amazing.</v>

4624
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Now I have my first special on Netflix in 2005.</v>

4625
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4626
02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.650
<v Speaker 3>That was my first video.</v>

4627
02:08:56.651 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Special.</v>

4628
02:08:57.610 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4629
02:08:58.090 --> 02:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

4630
02:08:58.650 --> 02:08:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4631
02:08:58.950 --> 02:09:03.670
<v Speaker 3>and that was the beginning of like the whole Internet for download.</v>

4632
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

4633
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Nobody really had the kind of broadband to get shit like instantaneously back</v>

4634
02:09:08.531 --> 02:09:13.531
<v Speaker 3>then it was really gratifying to dial up and 2005 or they had really shitty</v>

4635
02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:15.190
<v Speaker 3>cable or something like that.</v>

4636
02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:20.940
<v Speaker 3>But now Netflix has something like 70 million download or somebody million</v>

4637
02:09:20.981 --> 02:09:21.814
<v Speaker 3>customers.</v>

4638
02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4639
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.870
<v Speaker 3>it's big.</v>

4640
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So think about that.</v>

4641
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:26.590
<v Speaker 3>70 million people's spending seven bucks a month.</v>

4642
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:30.280
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're making shows because they have so much cash.</v>

4643
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:31.690
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking insane.</v>

4644
02:09:31.691 --> 02:09:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Money in sync about that every month.</v>

4645
02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:35.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4646
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that's they are there.</v>

4647
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:37.340
<v Speaker 3>They have a lot of cats.</v>

4648
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we make some shifts?</v>

4649
02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:39.791
<v Speaker 3>How much can that be?</v>

4650
02:09:39.791 --> 02:09:40.624
<v Speaker 3>A million an episode.</v>

4651
02:09:40.690 --> 02:09:41.291
<v Speaker 3>Not a big deal.</v>

4652
02:09:41.291 --> 02:09:42.880
<v Speaker 3>They have to have deals though too,</v>

4653
02:09:42.881 --> 02:09:44.890
<v Speaker 3>with like a cable providers and shit.</v>

4654
02:09:44.891 --> 02:09:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Remember they were throttling down there.</v>

4655
02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Netflix takes on $400,</v>

4656
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 3>million dollars in new debt to fund original content and European expansion.</v>

4657
02:09:54.490 --> 02:09:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4658
02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:57.423
<v Speaker 3>I'll make it back.</v>

4659
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4660
02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:01.780
<v Speaker 3>They'll make that shit back in a month.</v>

4661
02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I have a great idea for a Netflix special or movie.</v>

4662
02:10:05.261 --> 02:10:06.094
<v Speaker 3>Don't say it.</v>

4663
02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Someone will steal that shit.</v>

4664
02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:08.771
<v Speaker 3>You can't say,</v>

4665
02:10:08.771 --> 02:10:09.670
<v Speaker 3>I have a great idea.</v>

4666
02:10:11.330 --> 02:10:12.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I'm ever gonna do it.</v>

4667
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say,</v>

4668
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:13.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4669
02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:14.170
<v Speaker 3>don't give it.</v>

4670
02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Someone else will do it.</v>

4671
02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Just tell us when the shut this motherfucker down and the notes.</v>

4672
02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:22.870
<v Speaker 3>You have a lot of great ideas.</v>

4673
02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:23.111
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

4674
02:10:23.111 --> 02:10:24.100
<v Speaker 3>You're just lazy.</v>

4675
02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:24.970
<v Speaker 3>This is a funny idea.</v>

4676
02:10:24.971 --> 02:10:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really going to do this,</v>

4677
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:28.370
<v Speaker 3>but don't tell anybody man.</v>

4678
02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:29.441
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>

4679
02:10:29.441 --> 02:10:30.274
<v Speaker 3>Crazy?</v>

4680
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.751
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4681
02:10:31.751 --> 02:10:32.260
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

4682
02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:32.591
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4683
02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:34.430
<v Speaker 3>so people have got rid of their cable.</v>

4684
02:10:34.431 --> 02:10:34.761
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4685
02:10:34.761 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 3>And most people,</v>

4686
02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:37.033
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

4687
02:10:37.150 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of new.</v>

4688
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Every year there's more and more people that are getting rid of their cable.</v>

4689
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:41.700
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my friends don't have cable.</v>

4690
02:10:41.770 --> 02:10:43.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a.</v>

4691
02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:47.640
<v Speaker 6>One of the biggest things though is I'm somebody that likes to watch TV.</v>

4692
02:10:47.641 --> 02:10:48.510
<v Speaker 6>When I go to bed,</v>

4693
02:10:48.511 --> 02:10:51.600
<v Speaker 6>I like to have the TV on when I'm sleeping with Netflix.</v>

4694
02:10:51.601 --> 02:10:53.340
<v Speaker 6>Every time watch you watch something.</v>

4695
02:10:53.341 --> 02:10:55.610
<v Speaker 6>It says like this window pops up after the shows,</v>

4696
02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:56.670
<v Speaker 6>like are you still watching?</v>

4697
02:10:56.671 --> 02:10:57.690
<v Speaker 6>And then just turns off.</v>

4698
02:10:57.691 --> 02:10:59.250
<v Speaker 6>Then halfway through you have to like wake up,</v>

4699
02:10:59.490 --> 02:11:00.720
<v Speaker 6>turn on the TV again,</v>

4700
02:11:00.721 --> 02:11:01.680
<v Speaker 6>or hit play.</v>

4701
02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:05.520
<v Speaker 6>I just want to make a video or a movie that's like 12 hours long.</v>

4702
02:11:05.521 --> 02:11:05.880
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

4703
02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:08.770
<v Speaker 6>for people that just want to sleep and have their tv on</v>

4704
02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:10.773
<v Speaker 3>the good news,</v>

4705
02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.390
<v Speaker 3>the good news is no one's going to steal that.</v>

4706
02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.660
<v Speaker 3>That's a good idea to you.</v>

4707
02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever.</v>

4708
02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Do you do watch TV when you go to bed?</v>

4709
02:11:20.081 --> 02:11:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Like do you keep the shear off?</v>

4710
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I felt like a normal fucking bedroom.</v>

4711
02:11:24.581 --> 02:11:25.840
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you Brian?</v>

4712
02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:26.950
<v Speaker 3>But you know a lot of people that do that,</v>

4713
02:11:26.951 --> 02:11:27.191
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4714
02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:29.040
<v Speaker 3>You just go to Dr. Doctor.</v>

4715
02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4716
02:11:29.690 --> 02:11:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Get your brain examined.</v>

4717
02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.770
<v Speaker 3>The something wrong there.</v>

4718
02:11:32.771 --> 02:11:34.210
<v Speaker 3>You know there's something wrong with you.</v>

4719
02:11:34.211 --> 02:11:36.490
<v Speaker 3>She probably got a mouse size to live alone.</v>

4720
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:37.630
<v Speaker 3>You live alone.</v>

4721
02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think there's a lot of people that watch TV with like have to have the</v>

4722
02:11:41.081 --> 02:11:42.970
<v Speaker 3>TV on when they sleep and they want a 12.</v>

4723
02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Our netflix show to Jello in waistband.</v>

4724
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Just a great idea.</v>

4725
02:11:47.150 --> 02:11:47.501
<v Speaker 3>Sleeping,</v>

4726
02:11:47.501 --> 02:11:48.370
<v Speaker 3>not watching it.</v>

4727
02:11:48.450 --> 02:11:48.671
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4728
02:11:48.671 --> 02:11:49.504
<v Speaker 3>you should pitch that.</v>

4729
02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:50.980
<v Speaker 3>You should set up a meeting</v>

4730
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:55.960
<v Speaker 3>so they have another thing on netflix where it just goes to the next episode.</v>

4731
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 3>After awhile it's A.</v>

4732
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:58.870
<v Speaker 3>It's has this window pops up.</v>

4733
02:11:58.871 --> 02:11:59.141
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4734
02:11:59.141 --> 02:12:01.570
<v Speaker 3>are you still watching because it doesn't want you to do that.</v>

4735
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want you to waste with.</v>

4736
02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:08.320
<v Speaker 3>So maybe have a really small low rez video that's just like a normal movie</v>

4737
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:13.780
<v Speaker 3>soundtrack and know they're not going to do that to watch while you're falling</v>

4738
02:12:13.781 --> 02:12:16.600
<v Speaker 3>asleep and then the watcher while they're halfway awake and it's you and your</v>

4739
02:12:16.601 --> 02:12:17.940
<v Speaker 3>underwear playing with your feet.</v>

4740
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:19.450
<v Speaker 3>And boy this like,</v>

4741
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:20.830
<v Speaker 3>shut this off.</v>

4742
02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest hit for people who are asleep.</v>

4743
02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:24.023
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>

4744
02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:24.910
<v Speaker 3>No Man.</v>

4745
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:25.361
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

4746
02:12:25.361 --> 02:12:26.800
<v Speaker 3>No one thinks that's a good idea.</v>

4747
02:12:26.801 --> 02:12:27.634
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

4748
02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say.</v>

4749
02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.140
<v Speaker 3>No one I'll show you guys know what it will be.</v>

4750
02:12:32.141 --> 02:12:34.330
<v Speaker 3>The number one watched the movie on Netflix.</v>

4751
02:12:34.331 --> 02:12:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Just for people that want to go.</v>

4752
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It will be the number one wash for idiots.</v>

4753
02:12:39.970 --> 02:12:41.200
<v Speaker 3>People with head wounds,</v>

4754
02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.780
<v Speaker 3>people missing people.</v>

4755
02:12:46.050 --> 02:12:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>

4756
02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:48.280
<v Speaker 3>traditional deficiencies,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the can't see straight.</v>

4758
02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:51.460
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to work a remote,</v>

4759
02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.170
<v Speaker 3>can't find their glasses.</v>

4760
02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.000
<v Speaker 3>It streams and more eggs all around the country.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can you give us a preview without giving away the story?</v>

4784
02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

4788
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:21.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a theme.</v>

4789
02:13:21.190 --> 02:13:22.023
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4790
02:13:22.110 --> 02:13:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4791
02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I know my story though was about,</v>

4792
02:13:25.241 --> 02:13:26.074
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4793
02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.430
<v Speaker 3>when I was in high school,</v>

4794
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:27.911
<v Speaker 3>how I would,</v>

4795
02:13:27.911 --> 02:13:28.744
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4796
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I would sneak out of my house to go to my girlfriend's house.</v>

4797
02:13:31.951 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

4798
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 4>would come in for curfew and then sneak out and uh,</v>

4799
02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.720
<v Speaker 4>I had this whole system and I would sneak out and they get pushed my car into</v>

4800
02:13:39.721 --> 02:13:40.171
<v Speaker 4>the woods.</v>

4801
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:41.004
<v Speaker 4>And then yeah,</v>

4802
02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:44.460
<v Speaker 4>put your car into the woods and then start out and then Hyde Park it in the</v>

4803
02:13:44.461 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 4>woods by her house.</v>

4804
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4805
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 4>they live it out to her house and then push it into the woods so nobody could</v>

4806
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 4>hear it and not in the woods and hide in the bushes.</v>

4807
02:13:56.670 --> 02:14:00.440
<v Speaker 4>It was all about saying goodnight to my family and then going on and get going</v>

4808
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:00.810
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4809
02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:01.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4810
02:14:01.650 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 4>do do,</v>

4811
02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

4812
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:03.290
<v Speaker 4>It's A.</v>

4813
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a funnier story than the preview.</v>

4814
02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:07.470
<v Speaker 4>But Ari has a great show.</v>

4815
02:14:07.570 --> 02:14:11.820
<v Speaker 4>It was the point in time after at midnight already was on Conan last night.</v>

4816
02:14:11.821 --> 02:14:12.654
<v Speaker 4>Killed it.</v>

4817
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Killed it.</v>

4818
02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:14.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just stand up.</v>

4819
02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:15.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4820
02:14:15.341 --> 02:14:18.360
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gives a shit about Conan on CBS store or tvs or whatever the fuck.</v>

4821
02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 4>But it's such a good place to go do stand up.</v>

4822
02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:22.650
<v Speaker 4>The audiences are great.</v>

4823
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:23.940
<v Speaker 4>They do a good show.</v>

4824
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird.</v>

4825
02:14:24.841 --> 02:14:26.670
<v Speaker 4>It's just because no one's watching.</v>

4826
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.110
<v Speaker 4>It's just right.</v>

4827
02:14:28.190 --> 02:14:29.560
<v Speaker 4>What are the numbers like?</v>

4828
02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.110
<v Speaker 4>It's better than George Lopez.</v>

4829
02:14:31.111 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 4>Like $800,000.</v>

4830
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Judge Lopez show was on after it.</v>

4831
02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4832
02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:36.280
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do that.</v>

4833
02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Conan first and George Lopez accurately.</v>

4834
02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 4>It's below a million.</v>

4835
02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:41.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4836
02:14:41.701 --> 02:14:43.870
<v Speaker 4>they tried to do that thing that,</v>

4837
02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4838
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4839
02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:46.350
<v Speaker 4>late night thing on tbs,</v>

4840
02:14:46.351 --> 02:14:47.101
<v Speaker 4>they try to do it,</v>

4841
02:14:47.101 --> 02:14:48.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's like people are addicted to that.</v>

4842
02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 4>NBC,</v>

4843
02:14:49.801 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 4>CBS,</v>

4844
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.500
<v Speaker 4>sort of back and forth.</v>

4845
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:55.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what tbs is on your tv?</v>

4846
02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:56.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't even,</v>

4847
02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't either.</v>

4848
02:14:56.770 --> 02:14:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Never see it.</v>

4849
02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.740
<v Speaker 4>I could not tell you what the number.</v>

4850
02:14:58.741 --> 02:15:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like Sitcom reruns.</v>

4851
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:02.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what I think of when I think tbs.</v>

4852
02:15:02.521 --> 02:15:03.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's be,</v>

4853
02:15:03.190 --> 02:15:06.550
<v Speaker 4>I guess they have their own shows to cooperstown.</v>

4854
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:08.103
<v Speaker 4>Cooperstown.</v>

4855
02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4856
02:15:08.970 --> 02:15:10.380
<v Speaker 4>But that was an ABC show.</v>

4857
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:12.210
<v Speaker 4>It was cougar town was,</v>

4858

02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:17.850
<v Speaker 4>The problem is like whenever I like baseball and whenever there's the playoffs I</v>

4861
02:15:17.851 --> 02:15:18.301
<v Speaker 4>was going,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just there's so many channels now.</v>

4867
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:27.541
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

4868
02:15:27.541 --> 02:15:30.740
<v Speaker 4>And with things like Netflix essentially with Netflix is,</v>

4869
02:15:30.741 --> 02:15:31.290
<v Speaker 4>is uh,</v>

4870
02:15:31.290 --> 02:15:36.290
<v Speaker 4>is like a production company that's like a bridge to the Internet and the</v>

4871
02:15:36.631 --> 02:15:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Internet is where it's at.</v>

4872
02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is the future for all this stuff.</v>

4873
02:15:40.230 --> 02:15:40.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4874
02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:41.170
<v Speaker 4>all of it.</v>

4875
02:15:41.170 --> 02:15:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4876
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Probably with Netflix is though.</v>

4877
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.950
<v Speaker 4>This is a problem,</v>

4878
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:46.590
<v Speaker 4>you can't download it and keep it on your computer.</v>

4879
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't watch a netflix movie a on a plane.</v>

4880
02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:51.373
<v Speaker 4>That's stupid.</v>

4881
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:52.223
<v Speaker 4>That is a bummer.</v>

4882
02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:55.100
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't want you stealing and then take a pirate.</v>

4883
02:15:55.170 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 4>A stream it.</v>

4884
02:15:56.490 --> 02:16:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Why not do it like on when you rent a movie on itunes like you get once you play</v>

4885
02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:04.800
<v Speaker 4>it terminates in 24 hours.</v>

4886
02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:05.881
<v Speaker 4>Why did they do that?</v>

4887
02:16:05.881 --> 02:16:06.714
<v Speaker 4>Netflix?</v>

4888
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Well they should,</v>

4889
02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:10.740
<v Speaker 4>but I think and when you download something on Itunes,</v>

4890
02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:13.980
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a physical copy that you could copy and play.</v>

4891
02:16:13.981 --> 02:16:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Like it only appears in the APP.</v>

4892
02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4893
02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not like in a file somewhere.</v>

4894
02:16:18.241 --> 02:16:19.110
<v Speaker 4>We could find it.</v>

4895
02:16:19.150 --> 02:16:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Now it comes up on your ipad.</v>

4896
02:16:22.130 --> 02:16:23.670
<v Speaker 4>Your that Netflix.</v>

4897
02:16:23.671 --> 02:16:23.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4898
02:16:23.911 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 4>They should do that because that's annoying that you can't get something in</v>

4899
02:16:26.650 --> 02:16:27.510
<v Speaker 4>watching a plane.</v>

4900
02:16:27.511 --> 02:16:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I think that's whack.</v>

4901
02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:29.300
<v Speaker 4>Whack.</v>

4902
02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 4>And it's when you go back</v>

4903
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.813
<v Speaker 1>into piracy,</v>

4904
02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

4905
02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:33.993
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

4906
02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>they're going to arrest people.</v>

4907
02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 1>They put those pirate bay guys and they just fucking.</v>

4908
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 1>There's some new ruling.</v>

4909
02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Got passed on the Pirate Bay guys.</v>

4910
02:16:41.831 --> 02:16:42.664
<v Speaker 1>They're fucked.</v>

4911
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4912
02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4913
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:46.660
<v Speaker 1>They just actually rereleased pirate bay today,</v>

4914
02:16:46.661 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

4915
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what pirate bay is,</v>

4916
02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:49.690
<v Speaker 1>a new version of pirate bay.</v>

4917
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Bay is a site that allows you to find an access bit torrent files pretty</v>

4918
02:16:55.841 --> 02:16:56.420
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

4919
02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:59.580
<v Speaker 1>So like if Tom Papa is selling his,</v>

4920
02:16:59.590 --> 02:16:59.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4921
02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>his special online,</v>

4922
02:17:01.691 --> 02:17:04.060
<v Speaker 1>like if you do the Louis ck $5 thing,</v>

4923
02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>they would just bit torrent the shit out of it and people just,</v>

4924
02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4925
02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>somebody would buy it for five bucks,</v>

4926
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:10.090
<v Speaker 1>throw it up on bit torrent.</v>

4927
02:17:10.091 --> 02:17:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of people download it for free.</v>

4928
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Like movies.</v>

4929
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:14.141
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movies,</v>

4930
02:17:14.141 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>like the Sony Hack,</v>

4931
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 1>they released a lot of movies,</v>

4932
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:20.230
<v Speaker 1>some movies that aren't even done yet.</v>

4933
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:23.500
<v Speaker 1>She got files and just fucking throw my line.</v>

4934
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:24.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

4935
02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:25.480
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

4936
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I use it for illegal books and pdfs.</v>

4937
02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's legal reasons for pirate bay.</v>

4938
02:17:30.161 --> 02:17:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>

4939
02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:31.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4940
02:17:31.211 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4941
02:17:31.450 --> 02:17:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you could definitely get some stuff that's illegal.</v>

4942
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if you wanted to share things,</v>

4943
02:17:35.411 --> 02:17:38.620
<v Speaker 1>like say if you had a book and you decided you were going to release it for free</v>

4944
02:17:38.621 --> 02:17:40.240
<v Speaker 1>as a pdf with a lot of people do,</v>

4945
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you could just upload it and then people can get it anytime they want.</v>

4946
02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's like one of the arguments about what file sharing actually is.</v>

4947
02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says it's just piracy and guys like,</v>

4948
02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:54.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4949
02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Kim Dot com,</v>

4950
02:17:55.721 --> 02:17:57.640
<v Speaker 1>that dude from he lives in New Zealand.</v>

4951
02:17:57.641 --> 02:17:58.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they,</v>

4952
02:17:58.331 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

4953
02:17:58.750 --> 02:18:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they are fucking that guy hard.</v>

4954
02:18:00.401 --> 02:18:01.720
<v Speaker 1>They took all of his money.</v>

4955
02:18:01.721 --> 02:18:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He's going bankrupt.</v>

4956
02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:04.240
<v Speaker 1>They mean it's,</v>

4957
02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

4958
02:18:05.171 --> 02:18:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's because He created a mega upload and mega upload was a place where a</v>

4959
02:18:09.791 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 1>lot of people downloaded,</v>

4960
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4961
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:15.070
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote stolen or illegal files.</v>

4962
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Was it stolen?</v>

4963
02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:18.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4964
02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want your big show and read by all these criminals?</v>

4965
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:21.550
<v Speaker 1>What do you shot?</v>

4966
02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:22.070
<v Speaker 1>So alert.</v>

4967
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Stay away from the Pirate Bay website is we've gotten reports.</v>

4968
02:18:24.491 --> 02:18:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It has been seized indirectly by the FBI and his logging Ip.</v>

4969
02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Mr White,</v>

4970
02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I legally use it only for pdfs and you're going to.</v>

4971
02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Bay is an FBI honeypot,</v>

4972
02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:39.610
<v Speaker 1>a disconcertingly plausible conspiracy theory.</v>

4973
02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:40.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4974
02:18:40.451 --> 02:18:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that's totally plausible and it's from motherboard.com of taken me back.</v>

4975
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Motherboard.vice.com.</v>
