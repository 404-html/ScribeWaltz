191
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

192
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.723

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 2>w so mission thing or you,</v>

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>whoever wins.</v>

195
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I'm not a wrestler.</v>

196
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>So Bobby's like Bobby used to wrestle too,</v>

197
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>

198
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the referee and yeah,</v>

199
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>

200
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>whoever gets the first person down submit whatever they win,</v>

201
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.040

203
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get a Jujitsu guy down,</v>

204
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean Jack Shit.</v>

205
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.371
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

206
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>That's when the game starts.</v>

207
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.901
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

208
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.141
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

209
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.321
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>You know guys all about what you call he pawn slam a guy.</v>

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>It was just a,</v>

213
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess whoever gets someone in a hold that they can't get out of her,</v>

214
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>something undefined.</v>

215
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Undefined victories.</v>

216
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Cause there they're just no punching or kicking.</v>

218
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:43.154
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>

219
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

221
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 2>him working for me is not like sweeping the floor or whatever.</v>

222
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Him working for me is getting to fuck really hot chicks to great gig.</v>

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.341
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

252
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:19.731

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 3>And then he comes at me and he's small,</v>

258
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 3>but then he just like grabbed my arm or something gets me down and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then I can't get out of it.</v>

262
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>And then he just puts all of his mind into this hole and I'm just sitting there</v>

263
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 3>and I can't get out of it.</v>

264
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.523
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

265
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.161

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.164

269
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 3>And I was sitting there thinking,</v>

270
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.021
<v Speaker 3>fuck dude,</v>

271
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 3>I remember I told Joe that I was going to do this shit.</v>

272
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Like people have that glamorous idea that they're going to go and have an MMA</v>

273
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

274
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I would never discourage anybody from being an MMA fighter.</v>

275
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I think you live and you die if you want to be a bull rider.</v>

276
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 3>If you want to ride motocross,</v>

277
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 3>if you want to drive Formula One,</v>

278
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.244
<v Speaker 3>race cars,</v>

279
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 3>all those things are dangerous.</v>

280
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 3>All those things are awesome.</v>

281
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

282

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

286
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

287
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.600

289
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:15.651
<v Speaker 3>I did it for free.</v>

290
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 3>There was no money involved in it.</v>

291
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

292
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I had no insurance.</v>

293
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I had no health insurance.</v>

294
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.980

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 3>really low sugar,</v>

343
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 3>and you'll hear that shit within a few months.</v>

344
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

345
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 3>you just met him right now.</v>

346
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

347
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 3>credit credit's going to do it.</v>

348
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

349
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

350
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when I made my money.</v>

351
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I naturally,</v>

352
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I just don't trust people.</v>

353
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 3>So I made the room naturally before or I just always,</v>

354
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:55.484
<v Speaker 3>I just don't trust people.</v>

355
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>So I</v>

356
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 2>just made the rookie mistake.</v>

357
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>You've heard the expression before,</v>

358
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 2>don't hire your friends and family.</v>

359
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 2>And I hired all,</v>

360
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>only my friends and family and I was like,</v>

361
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362

369
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:14.491

388
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>how come I do have all this money and I hired all these guys and I'm overpaying</v>

394
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:50.431
<v Speaker 2>no more Asians.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Very racist.</v>

398
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Shins are very hard workers as long as you're not your family.</v>

399
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

402
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

403
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.153
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to,</v>

404
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.061
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

405
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:03.241
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

406
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 2>it's very racist and I was like,</v>

407
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

408
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.050
<v Speaker 2>because you want to,</v>

409
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I want to try something different.</v>

410
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I already wrote the yellow train and we get on a white shirt.</v>

411
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

412
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.421
<v Speaker 2>so I hired,</v>

413
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I hired people that are not friends I'm friendly with,</v>

414
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but they're not my homeys.</v>

415
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

416
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 2>and then there they were hired for specifically what their job was like.</v>

417
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>If you're a trainer then that's what I,</v>

422
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.031
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

423
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 2>friended all of them.</v>

436
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

437
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>which it is most of the time.</v>

626
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

634
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.493

635
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.000

639
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like those students are all movies.</v>

646
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

647
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

648
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.433
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

649
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.730
<v Speaker 2>What you need is someone who's a Dietitian,</v>

650
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 2>someone is going to be that you can hire like a professional chef.</v>

651
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Kevin James used to have this guy who worked for him.</v>

652
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It was fantastic.</v>

653
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 2>He had this guy working for him all day,</v>

654
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

655
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 2>The guy would cook all these meals and he would leave pre prepared,</v>

656
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 2>like really healthy meals in his refrigerator.</v>

657
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Then he hired some woman to do it after that.</v>

658
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:47.661
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

659
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>So I did that for a little bit.</v>

660
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I've got this,</v>

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.801
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm talking about.</v>

664
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

665
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the name of the service,</v>

666
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 2>but they deliver the meal every day.</v>

667
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.943
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of those.</v>

668
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Susan's healthy gourmet is one that I used for awhile.</v>

669
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.083
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

670
00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.451

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 2>first of all was miserable.</v>

675
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 2>The meal started to stack up in the,</v>

676
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.750
<v Speaker 2>in the refrigerator.</v>

677
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

678
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

679
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.980

00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:09.270

683
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm on this program.</v>

684
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

685
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 2>But then weren't really eating it,</v>

686
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 2>but then I'd look at it or I'd look or I'd eat it and go,</v>

687
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:14.601
<v Speaker 2>oh cool,</v>

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I ate good today.</v>

690
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And then like at three in the morning,</v>

691
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 2>still go out and get the Burrito.</v>

692
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

693
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>so the thing I'm doing now,</v>

694
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 2>which I already can see,</v>

695
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

696
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible and everyone says it doesn't work,</v>

697
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm sort of like stuck in this weird thing is I,</v>

698

00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:41.480
<v Speaker 2>diets aren't going to work.</v>

702
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

703
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

704
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 2>This has to be a lifestyle change,</v>

705
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

706
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't like go for three months eating salads and then be like,</v>

707
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

708
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I got my weight down,</v>

709
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I got my cholesterol down,</v>

710
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I got my diabetes down.</v>

711
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And then going back to it,</v>

712
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to have.</v>

713
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

714
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.010
<v Speaker 2>but I love food.</v>

715
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.093
<v Speaker 2>I love eating.</v>

716
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And so the thing I'm doing now,</v>

717
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.933
<v Speaker 2>which I put,</v>

718
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 2>didn't put too much research into his chewing and spitting.</v>

719
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.553
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

720
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I know guys who did that with meat.</v>

721
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 2>There's some MMA fighters.</v>

722
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Like Diego Sanchez was doing that for awhile.</v>

723
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.101
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't eat meat.</v>

724
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>He would just chew it up.</v>

725
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible for your head.</v>

726
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:12.891
<v Speaker 2>It isn't really,</v>

727
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible for you because first of all so you get like,</v>

728
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:17.114
<v Speaker 2>so I'll,</v>

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll order like three entrees,</v>

730
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll get spaghetti fried chicken,</v>

731
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 2>steak,</v>

732
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.701
<v Speaker 2>I'll get pie,</v>

733
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll order everything.</v>

734
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just like Roman Times gluttony to the Max.</v>

735
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:28.814
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

736
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.570
<v Speaker 2>And I'll have like the worst is if it's at a nice restaurant cause then they</v>

737
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:33.404
<v Speaker 2>don't have the,</v>

738
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 2>they have like cloth Napkins and I'm like,</v>

739
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:37.310
<v Speaker 2>can you bring some more of those paper Napkins?</v>

740
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.260
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting there and I'm like are,</v>

741
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just chewing everything,</v>

742
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 2>getting all the flavor out of it.</v>

743
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm spitting it,</v>

744
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 2>which the mouth,</v>

745
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:48.500
<v Speaker 2>as soon as it starts chewing and making saliva,</v>

746
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>the stomach starts making acid</v>

747
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 3>to prepare for the food coop to come down.</v>

748
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

749
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 3>But if the food never comes down,</v>

750
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 3>there's just like acid in your stomach,</v>

751
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.270
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

752
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.600
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

753
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 3>and also when you eat,</v>

754
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.770
<v Speaker 3>all the sugar already goes into your,</v>

755
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 3>like before it hits your stomach,</v>

756
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:03.020
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

757
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm eating all this food.</v>

759
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.850

760
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and then putting it like on the plate and then the dude's comes sooner.</v>

761
00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Is there,</v>

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 3>is there something wrong with the meal?</v>

763
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:14.881

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Technology.</v>

819
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>

820
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 3>my Japanese business partner,</v>

821
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I work with this company.</v>

822
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Good smile.</v>

823
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not legal in America yet,</v>

824
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 3>but he has,</v>

825
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.701
<v Speaker 3>he smokes,</v>

826
00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:48.151
<v Speaker 3>he drinks,</v>

827
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:48.984
<v Speaker 3>he eats all this shit.</v>

828
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what this process is called.</v>

829
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 3>You might have heard of it but he wants a month.</v>

830
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 3>This is like real rich guy shit.</v>

831
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.490
<v Speaker 3>He gets all like a lot of his blood taken out and then they do shit to it.</v>

832
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Like they make it into super blood and then he puts it back into them and then</v>

833
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 3>all everything goes down.</v>

834
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

835
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

836
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

837
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:07.291
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

838
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.124
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

839
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.523
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

840
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 3>it's not FDA,</v>

841
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.600
<v Speaker 3>whatever test it is not in America yet.</v>

842
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.770
<v Speaker 3>And so I do this thing called Regena Kane and I have done today actually on my</v>

843
00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>shoulder had been bothering me.</v>

844
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.280
<v Speaker 3>They take,</v>

845
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:25.281
<v Speaker 3>they take your blood out and they spin it in a centrifuge and apply heat to it.</v>

846
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.290
<v Speaker 3>And so your blood thinks like it has a fever and it creates this anti</v>

847
00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory response and creates this like yellow serum on and they extract the</v>

848
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 3>yellow serum out of your blood and then they inject it directly in areas where</v>

849
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 3>you have inflammation.</v>

850
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh really good for a injuries.</v>

851
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.141
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

852
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like when you do it like I did it today,</v>

853
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:43.201
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

854
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you just feel great.</v>

855
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.093
<v Speaker 3>Like go gray right now.</v>

856
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Dana White told me about it cause he has a inner ear infection,</v>

857
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

858
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 1>an issue rather called [inaudible] disease and it's from um,</v>

859
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 1>he got beat up one time when he was young but a bunch of guys and is,</v>

860
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 1>he gets this tonight,</v>

861
00:20:56.441 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like ringing in his ear and it fucks with his balance and shit and it's all</v>

862
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:01.084
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

863
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Well they figured out a way to inject this,</v>

864
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

865
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 1>this serum made out of your blood and it totally cured it for him.</v>

866
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.240
<v Speaker 1>He went through surgeries,</v>

867
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.550
<v Speaker 1>he was on medication,</v>

868
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 1>he did a bunch of shit that really fucked with them.</v>

869
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>But this stuff instead of fucking with them,</v>

870
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it uses your own blood and it made him feel fantastic.</v>

871
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And he used to have to go to Germany for it and I was going to fly to Germany.</v>

872
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:21.694
<v Speaker 1>You go do this.</v>

873
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But then they started opening these places around.</v>

874
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Now they have one lifespan medicine in Santa Monica.</v>

875
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I did this morning.</v>

876
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what I'm talking about,</v>

877
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:27.431
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

878
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

879
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I get the whole like,</v>

880
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you need to suffer to like,</v>

881
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

883
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's for injuries.</v>

884
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.011
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

885
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:33.641
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

886
00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>do you have any injuries you could use as an excuse to get this?</v>

887
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like the way technology's going now.</v>

888
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

889
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you're covered in tattoos,</v>

890
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.771
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

891
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:42.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

892
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 1>in five years they're going to have some ray that just gets rid of all your</v>

893
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:45.011
<v Speaker 1>clarity.</v>

894
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Do they have lasers?</v>

895
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I drag them out.</v>

896
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not good right now,</v>

897
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but what's painful?</v>

898
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 1>But it will get in and they'll make it so it's not,</v>

899
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have everything.</v>

901
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

902
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

904
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 1>do I need to like really switch my eating habits?</v>

905
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Are they gonna make like a,</v>

906
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

907
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 1>some oculus rift fake hamburger where I'm like,</v>

908
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.691
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

909
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious and not,</v>

910
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

912
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>This is my take on it.</v>

913
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I think gluttony and eating like lots of delicious food is fun,</v>

914
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:09.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

915
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But feeling like shit is not fun.</v>

916
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And what I like to do is have cheat days.</v>

917
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.540
<v Speaker 1>What I like to do is I really like,</v>

918
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.890
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've eaten today so far.</v>

919
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.871
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

920
00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 1>a blended juice drink,</v>

921
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>which was like celery,</v>

922
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>ginger,</v>

923
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.873
<v Speaker 1>carrot,</v>

924
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 1>a cucumber.</v>

925
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:27.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember all the,</v>

926
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>a Cayenne pepper,</v>

927
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Oregano oil,</v>

928
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 1>lemon,</v>

929
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

930
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic for you.</v>

931
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:36.071
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

932
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I had for breakfast.</v>

933
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing I,</v>

934
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I it this morning is today unshaved Pussy Lips,</v>

935
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 1>slight hint of urinary tract infection that's I have today.</v>

936
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And I feel great.</v>

937
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're going to feel great and a couple of hours once the</v>

938
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:52.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking infection kicks in,</v>

939
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

940
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but I got an iron stomach.</v>

941
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go to fucking in and out Burger man.</v>

942
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.851
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck ups.</v>

943
00:22:57.851 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I had Popeye's chicken last night,</v>

944
00:22:59.441 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

945
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And so because you ate that,</v>

946
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 1>that's why you gotta hit this weird ginger drink.</v>

947
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I eat primarily healthy.</v>

948
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

949
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Primarily healthy.</v>

950
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

951
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>But then occasionally I go off the rails.</v>

952
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

953
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.010
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time my body's getting healthy food.</v>

954
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

955
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the key because you feel better,</v>

956
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:14.480
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

957
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and you will feel better.</v>

958
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:16.234
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

959
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.961
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better.</v>

960
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>You'll have more energy.</v>

961
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I drink these blended Kale shakes in the morning and making myself,</v>

962
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I throw Kale,</v>

963
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:23.280
<v Speaker 1>tastes like shit.</v>

964
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:23.531
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

965
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

966
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>don't you use the spinach?</v>

967
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 1>You can do that too,</v>

968
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>but I like Kale.</v>

969
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

970
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a superfood or spinach.</v>

971
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>A superfood too.</v>

972
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.543
<v Speaker 1>They're all good,</v>

973
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>but I failed to hit up kills hip or and fucking strong.</v>

974
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

975
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.530
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lot of nutrients in it.</v>

976
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:36.364
<v Speaker 1>It's really good for you.</v>

977
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:36.821
<v Speaker 1>What's better?</v>

978
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:37.654
<v Speaker 1>Kale or spinach?</v>

979
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Probably with the,</v>

980
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 1>probably Kale because it's a little darker.</v>

981
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>A little green.</v>

982
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.543
<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>

983
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Like dark green leafy vegetables.</v>

984
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>They have fido nutrients</v>

985
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of vitamins and stuff and you'd get something out of them.</v>

986
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.113
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

987
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.111
<v Speaker 3>when I eat,</v>

988
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

989
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a bowl like this.</v>

990
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

991

994
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Like a big fucking salad bowl that you would give to like a family.</v>

999
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I drink that shit myself with four cloves of garlic.</v>

1000
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I throw a whole apple in there.</v>

1001
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.221
<v Speaker 3>Ginger,</v>

1002
00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:11.790

1004
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 3>a thumb size chunk of ginger.</v>

1005
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just everybody else who tastes it goes,</v>

1006
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you drinking?</v>

1007
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.770

<v Speaker 3>I throw that shit down and it's like rocket fuel.</v>

1009
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.393
<v Speaker 3>I feel great.</v>

1010
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 3>I feel fucking fantastic.</v>

1011
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 3>It's better than coffee.</v>

1012
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I have like a Tereso Bacon Burger.</v>

1013
00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.090
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 3>You got rid of that gluten and then I feel supercharged to take a nap.</v>

1019
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:38.931
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1020
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:39.690

1021
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1022
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1023
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I think you're enjoying your success and you're enjoying your wealth and your</v>

1024
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 3>joint pleasure.</v>

1025
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.570

1026
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.381
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>

1027
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things about artists is artists are very indulgent.</v>

1028
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting that about my comedian friends and you know,</v>

1031
00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Self destructive,</v>

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:22.881
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1053
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:23.714
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1054
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.360
<v Speaker 3>my problem with the Internet is I,</v>

1055
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 3>I always think it's like the wild west when it's actually not,</v>

1056
00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:30.600
<v Speaker 3>so almost everything I put up on youtube or,</v>

1057
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.480
<v Speaker 3>or a Vimeo gets flagged.</v>

1058
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I just put up a new episode of my show DVDs and they got flag.</v>

1059
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 3>So it gets flagged for what?</v>

1060
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Just there's nakedness,</v>

1061
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 3>nakedness or whatever.</v>

1062

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1063
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I think in the,</v>

1064
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 3>so you took a,</v>

1065

1070
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 3>It's that anybody can go on there and change it.</v>

1071
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Now they could say Dave's a fag or whatever and it'll,</v>

1072
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:52.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1076
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 3>You made a Wikipedia out of it.</v>

1077
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.633
<v Speaker 3>We used to do that.</v>

1078
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 3>We used their technology and we just was like,</v>

1079
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 3>if some,</v>

1358
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>well first of all talk about Instagram.</v>

1359
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I went on years and like someone found their high school drawing art like Oh</v>

1360
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1367
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you were pretty good and yet all you like went crazy with the detail.</v>

1368
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I see a young guy with like lots of detailed like that motherfuckers,</v>

1369
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 3>a lot of energy that's usually from like ray,</v>

1370
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 3>especially in the subject matter,</v>

1371
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 3>like the rage growing every fucking hair on the Werewolf's face whenever the</v>

1372
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 3>teeth with the glistening with the fucking blood and whatever.</v>

00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1378
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.510

1380
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:03.760
<v Speaker 3>From what I saw.</v>

1381
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 3>And how old were you when you do that?</v>

1382
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in high school?</v>

1383
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Probably 15 or 16 that's what I'm saying.</v>

1384
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you stopped at some point,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1391
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for the dude because he was,</v>

1392
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:18.350
<v Speaker 3>it was clearly a Dork.</v>

1393
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1394

<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1398
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 3>He had this way of talking about shit where he just killed all your dreams.</v>

1399
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I taught like I would draw all like Conan the barbarian and Ninjas and that's an</v>

1400
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:36.610
<v Speaker 3>werewolves and I would draw shit that I would like to teach bullshit teenage boy</v>

1401
00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:36.950
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1402
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1403
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I would do,</v>

1404
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I did a whole series.</v>

1405
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.411
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

1406
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:40.191
<v Speaker 3>That's a little red riding.</v>

1407
00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:41.500
<v Speaker 3>I did a whole series of,</v>

1408
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1409
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 3>like little kid stories that went wrong.</v>

1410
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.840
<v Speaker 3>The three little pigs is a werewolf.</v>

1411
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Fucking just attacks the pigs.</v>

1412
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I had Humpty Dumpty,</v>

1413
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:50.361
<v Speaker 3>I pulled that one up.</v>

1414
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:50.751
<v Speaker 3>Eventually.</v>

1415
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Humpty dumpty with the ax.</v>

1416
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.753
<v Speaker 3>You're an artist.</v>

1417
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 3>You're an artist.</v>

1418
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1419
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Well I certainly was.</v>

1420
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was going to do for a living until I started fighting.</v>

1421
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started fighting I became completely obsessed with that cause it</v>

1422
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 3>was so primal and so much different than anything else I'd ever done.</v>

1423
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.020
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1424
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 3>see we have the same story up until then,</v>

1425
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 3>or even up until then,</v>

1426
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 3>because in high school I drew like that too,</v>

1427
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 3>like crazy detail or whatever.</v>

1428
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 3>And then I started fighting too and I loved it and I,</v>

1429
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 3>and then I started fighting all the time,</v>

1430
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 3>except I never won 90% of the fights.</v>

1431
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I get my ass.</v>

1432
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.183
<v Speaker 3>I still love it.</v>

1433
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.611
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1434
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:22.791
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1435

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1438
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of anger.</v>

1439
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do that.</v>

1440
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.001
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1441

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:30.500

1445
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.221

<v Speaker 3>the most important one for me.</v>

1450
00:34:39.031 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 3>It was this dude,</v>

1451
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.200
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't even like fighting.</v>

1452
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like he was this kid,</v>

1453
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 3>like they bust these,</v>

1454
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:45.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1455
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.000
<v Speaker 3>these black kids and from bad neighborhoods,</v>

1456
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Newton south high.</v>

1457
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.840
<v Speaker 3>And there was this one kid and me and him,</v>

1458
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:53.270
<v Speaker 3>we still look at each other like in the hallway and like,</v>

1459
00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:53.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1460
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 3>he would stare at me and I would stare him that nothing really happened.</v>

1461
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 3>But then one day we were in the locker room together and I was passing him.</v>

1462
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.100
<v Speaker 3>He looked at me and uh,</v>

1463
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what was said,</v>

1464
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 3>but I remember the dude grabbed me and hip toss me down to the ground,</v>

1465
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 3>throw me on my back and held me down and he was thinking about punching me.</v>

1466
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.920
<v Speaker 3>He was like holding me,</v>

1467
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.753
<v Speaker 3>my like,</v>

1468
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and just held me and then let me up.</v>

1469
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I was totally humiliated,</v>

1470
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.151
<v Speaker 3>totally humiliated.</v>

1471
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:18.620
<v Speaker 3>He said the n word with the Er?</v>

1472
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1473
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.521
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1474
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:19.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1475
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:19.941
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1476
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:20.121
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1477
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:21.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see anything of Kimmy.</v>

1478
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I think I said like what the fuck you know,</v>

1479
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>or something like when he was home,</v>

1480
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.213
<v Speaker 3>but I realized,</v>

1481
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:25.950
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1482
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to wrestle.</v>

1483
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 3>I think I was probably 14 I was like,</v>

1484
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:29.041
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

1485
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1486
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 3>I need to learn how to read.</v>

1487
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:32.290
<v Speaker 3>This is humiliating feeling you like I,</v>

1488
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to ever feel that it was terrible.</v>

1489
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I had never had taken like a couple of karate classes then,</v>

1490
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1491
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 1>know grappling whatsoever.</v>

1492
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.451
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1493
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 1>So at the same time I joined the wrestling team and I started getting really</v>

1494
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>serious about taekwondo at the very same time.</v>

1495
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It was because of that dude.</v>

1496
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I owe him.</v>

1497
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:48.270
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1498
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.630
<v Speaker 1>he made me who I became like for real because he humiliated the shit out of me.</v>

1499
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1500
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.360
<v Speaker 2>like that changed your course down that path.</v>

1501
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:58.460
<v Speaker 2>But if that never happened and you stuck with the art,</v>

1502
00:35:58.461 --> 00:35:59.294
<v Speaker 2>I mean that looks,</v>

1503
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean that looks pretty good.</v>

1504
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1505
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed art.</v>

1506
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.701
<v Speaker 1>I still do.</v>

1507
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:03.331
<v Speaker 1>I still draw.</v>

1508
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:03.661
<v Speaker 1>I was draw,</v>

1509
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:03.871
<v Speaker 1>draw,</v>

1510
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:04.640
<v Speaker 1>draw like that.</v>

1511
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1512
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I could still do it like that.</v>

1513
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean do electronic crosshatching and all that stuff.</v>

1514
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1515
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I love cross hatching.</v>

1516
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

1518
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I love deep.</v>

1519
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I like to do um,</v>

1520
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>like pencil and then ballpoint pen over the pencil.</v>

1521
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 1>That's like my favorite style of,</v>

1522
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I have some other stuff that I'll put up that I did like that I want to check it</v>

1523
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:19.640
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1524
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Cause like technical pens,</v>

1525
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I always found to be like a little too permanent.</v>

1526
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I like seeing,</v>

1527
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>like though I feel like with a ballpoint pen you could sorta almost barely touch</v>

1528
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the paper and the image just starts to slowly come out.</v>

1529
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Do this with your kids.</v>

1530
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Ballpoint pen drawn bananas.</v>

1531
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that sensation of a ballpoint pen on a banana is like the best thing.</v>

1532
00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.320
<v Speaker 2>And then like the next day when the,</v>

1533
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.183
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1534
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.300
<v Speaker 2>the banana peel dries up,</v>

1535
00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.260
<v Speaker 2>the drawing looks different.</v>

1536
00:36:44.261 --> 00:36:45.190
<v Speaker 2>My kids love art.</v>

1537
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun thing.</v>

1539
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.780
<v Speaker 2>But my progression was,</v>

1540
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.640
<v Speaker 2>was the same thing.</v>

1541
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Everything in high school was this shit like crosshatching pen,</v>

1542
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.033
<v Speaker 2>pencil,</v>

1543
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.480
<v Speaker 2>prisma colors.</v>

1544
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.441
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1545
00:36:56.441 --> 00:36:57.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1546
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1547
00:36:57.401 --> 00:36:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I discovered spray paint,</v>

1548
00:36:58.571 --> 00:36:59.830
<v Speaker 2>which was like the fucking,</v>

1549
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.780
<v Speaker 2>like the best thing ever.</v>

1550
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:02.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1551
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.591
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1552
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I discovered the Matrix,</v>

1553
00:37:03.611 --> 00:37:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:04.721
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1555
00:37:04.721 --> 00:37:05.554
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1556
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1557
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:07.960
<v Speaker 2>acrylic and oil paint.</v>

1558
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.370
<v Speaker 2>But what I discovered now after painting and drawing for years is that</v>

1559
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.130
<v Speaker 2>all those things I just said,</v>

1560
00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:16.120
<v Speaker 2>spray paint oil,</v>

1561
00:37:16.121 --> 00:37:19.090
<v Speaker 2>acrylic is you just even pencils.</v>

1562
00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you draw something,</v>

1563
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you create something and if you don't like it,</v>

1564
00:37:22.631 --> 00:37:23.321
<v Speaker 2>you just paint over it,</v>

1565
00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:24.154
<v Speaker 2>you just erase it.</v>

1566
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:24.941
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1567
00:37:24.941 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1568
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.070
<v Speaker 2>the new thing that like,</v>

1569
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.993
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1570
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.583
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

1571
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.240
<v Speaker 2>like alchemy or like painting with,</v>

1572
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.830
<v Speaker 2>with magic is the watercolor.</v>

1573
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.933
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1574
00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like the medium in art that has like,</v>

1575
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1576
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say like the least amount of respect because it's like,</v>

1577
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:39.671
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1578
00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:40.151
<v Speaker 2>watercolor,</v>

1579
00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:41.350
<v Speaker 2>you think of like old ladies,</v>

1580
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:41.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:42.940
<v Speaker 2>on some ways that,</v>

1582
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1583
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but like this whole book that I did is all watercolors.</v>

1584
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like 300 pages of watercolors.</v>

1585
00:37:49.001 --> 00:37:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1586
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:50.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1587
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pretty well respected artists now.</v>

1588
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I should be able to get this thing published.</v>

1589
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have to like self publish it and I don't want to self publish it.</v>

1590
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:58.780
<v Speaker 2>That's like in the same way,</v>

1591
00:37:58.781 --> 00:38:00.700
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to put up my own,</v>

1592
00:38:00.701 --> 00:38:01.534
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1593
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 2>what do you call like of um,</v>

1594
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1595
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to start my own youtube or whatever.</v>

1596
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I just would rather to do the art and have like a respected publication,</v>

1597
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.503
<v Speaker 2>put it out.</v>

1598
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.900
<v Speaker 2>So I turned the book in and start this book bidding war with all the published,</v>

1599
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.020
<v Speaker 2>all the cool artsy publishers don't want to put it out.</v>

1600
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.801
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1601
00:38:17.801 --> 00:38:18.634
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

1602
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you got to take these four pages out.</v>

1603
00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:21.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1604
00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:23.110
<v Speaker 2>our legal team looked at it and you know,</v>

1605
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:24.370
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's obscenity laws.</v>

1606
00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't put an ar 15 in a girl's butthole.</v>

1607
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.983
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

1608
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.033
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

1609
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1611
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1612
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:32.711
<v Speaker 2>it's art.</v>

1613
00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:33.730
<v Speaker 2>And I thought like,</v>

1614
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.660
<v Speaker 2>we lived in America,</v>

1615
00:38:34.661 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I thought you do whatever,</v>

1616
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1617
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 2>and I keep,</v>

1618
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1619
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess I keep pushing things and finding out that you can't do them,</v>

1620
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.853
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

1621
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.311
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1622
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 2>you just can't do it in their forum.</v>

1623
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:44.711
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1624
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

1625
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.173
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

1626
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.261
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

1627
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1628
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 2>we might get sued.</v>

1629
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1630
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>well by who?</v>

1631
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1632
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It's always like this preemptive like this imaginary fear and I go,</v>

1633
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 2>we need people like you out there.</v>

1634
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I go look like,</v>

1635
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and I was excited cause I was like,</v>

1636
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 2>oh these are like the publishers that I like,</v>

1637
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I would love to work with you.</v>

1638
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

1639
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 2>oh so I,</v>

1640
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1641
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I put the book out myself and it's like we sold it out like the special edition</v>

1642
00:39:10.241 --> 00:39:11.074
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

1643
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get it to that David show.com but it's,</v>

1644
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 2>we made so much money on it,</v>

1645
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

1646
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say this like I'm bragging,</v>

1647
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I didn't even want to make that money.</v>

1648
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1649
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I would rather someone else to make that money.</v>

1650
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to put it out.</v>

1651
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's like they wouldn't do it.</v>

1652
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 2>So you had to do it yourself.</v>

1653
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1654
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of,</v>

1655
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 2>I bring that up because I'd rather just,</v>

1656
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to just do a video on and throw it up on Youtube.</v>

1657
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:34.511
<v Speaker 2>That's so easy.</v>

1658
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking find,</v>

1659
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:36.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1660
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like I just want to make shit and just put it out there,</v>

1661
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but everything I do gets taken down.</v>

1662
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 2>So I just gotta you know,</v>

1663
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just you are,</v>

1664
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>you are an unusual guy and an unusual,</v>

1665
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.720
<v Speaker 2>an unusual situation and you want it to be free.</v>

1666
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 2>You want to be free to express yourself.</v>

1667
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.001
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1668
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:53.030
<v Speaker 2>someone could say like,</v>

1669
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck him and he's this and he's that and he's arrogant and he's this.</v>

1670
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:56.921
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1671
00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:57.161
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1672
00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:57.581
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1673
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:58.391
<v Speaker 2>you're being free.</v>

1674
00:39:58.391 --> 00:39:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You're not worried.</v>

1675
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not being a fake.</v>

1676
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.130
<v Speaker 2>You are actually doing things that you're interested in.</v>

1677
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot of ways this isn't,</v>

1678
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 2>we is a real problem that we have in society with needing someone to publish</v>

1679
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 2>your stuff.</v>

1680
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Because if you need someone to publish your stuffed and they're going to have to</v>

1681
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 2>approve it and then you're not going to get the original vision of the artist or</v>

1682
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.870
<v Speaker 2>the writer or whatever,</v>

1683
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a bunch of other people's in pink opinions of what you</v>

1684
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 2>should broadcast when you should publish.</v>

1685
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:22.691
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

1686
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:25.230
<v Speaker 2>can I ask you this because you are like,</v>

1687
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 2>since I first did your show,</v>

1688
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I think the first time I ever did you show,</v>

1689
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been on TV.</v>

1690
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 2>And since I've been on,</v>

1691
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1692
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1693
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 2>you have like a long career in TV,</v>

1694
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you fear factor or the UFC stuff.</v>

1695
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been on TV twice now.</v>

1696
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I did Anthony Bourdain shows,</v>

1697
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 2>parts unknown and I did,</v>

1698
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:42.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1699
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I do the news for Hbo,</v>

1700
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 2>for Vice Hbo and both shows that I've been on one Emmy's and like,</v>

1701
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything I do doesn't have to be guns in buttholes.</v>

1702
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.781
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1703
00:40:54.781 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1704
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I can work,</v>

1705
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:56.663
<v Speaker 2>they can do with it.</v>

1706
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.461
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1707
00:40:57.461 --> 00:40:57.761
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1708
00:40:57.761 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>do do comedy but don't cuss.</v>

1709
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.513
<v Speaker 2>And then I could do it.</v>

1710
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.653
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1711
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.930
<v Speaker 2>so the two times I did TV,</v>

1712
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:05.764
<v Speaker 2>like it's like,</v>

1713
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1714
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.341
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>

1715
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:06.971
<v Speaker 2>those shows you won,</v>

1716
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>won,</v>

1717
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:07.841
<v Speaker 2>won Emmy's.</v>

1718
00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And so the floodgates sort of open in like,</v>

1719
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:13.710
<v Speaker 2>now I have all these people interested in doing shows with me and,</v>

1720
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.583
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

1721
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 2>do you ever have this experience?</v>

1722
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.231
<v Speaker 2>Because then,</v>

1723
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:16.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1724
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:16.761
<v Speaker 2>you know a lot,</v>

1725
00:41:16.761 --> 00:41:18.430
<v Speaker 2>a lot of rich people and whatever.</v>

1726
00:41:18.431 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I sit in board rooms with like CEOs and people that run these companies and</v>

1727
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 2>they're billionaires and they run the world.</v>

1728
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 2>They have way more money than me.</v>

1729
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>They have way more power,</v>

1730
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:29.021
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>

1731
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:29.854
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1732
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>And they're still not free men.</v>

1733
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.900
<v Speaker 2>They're the answer to,</v>

1734
00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:34.870

1744
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:43.970

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.033
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1748
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>

1749
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 3>you have all the money in the world yet you still have to answer to</v>

1750
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 3>shareholders.</v>

1751
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Like your business partners,</v>

1752
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.611
<v Speaker 3>your wife.</v>

1753
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1754
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 3>I made a conscious decision not to get married.</v>

1755
00:41:58.521 --> 00:41:59.354
<v Speaker 3>I don't have kids.</v>

1756
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't work for anybody.</v>

1757
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like,</v>

1758
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1759
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 3>it would be so easy for me to just sign this deal and do this TV show.</v>

1760
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.124
<v Speaker 3>But then they're like,</v>

1761
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 3>but then you can't have Han dynasty on your team that don't ever let anybody</v>

1762
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 3>take you from doing what you're doing.</v>

1763
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.281
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1764
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 3>no one says,</v>

1765
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 3>well the nice thing is no one says you can't do it.</v>

1766
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.701
<v Speaker 3>They just go,</v>

1767
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be on our team,</v>

1768
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 3>then you can't do this shit.</v>

1769
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this Hong Dynasty saying you can't do it.</v>

1770
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.401
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1771
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard that one,</v>

1772
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 3>but I don't projects before with have told me to take down my website,</v>

1773
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.550
<v Speaker 3>take down your message board,</v>

1774
00:42:27.551 --> 00:42:27.890

<v Speaker 3>Like fuck you.</v>

1776
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1777
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking out shit because if you want me to do that,</v>

1778
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:32.990
<v Speaker 3>you want me to compromise myself.</v>

1779
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 3>That's going to start there and it's going to end up with me wearing a fucking</v>

1780
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:36.891
<v Speaker 3>suit,</v>

1781
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 3>sitting behind a desk,</v>

1782
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>talking to some idiot about his sitcom that I could give two fucks about what</v>

1783
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1784
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's a weird thing cause it's like I didn't give a shit.</v>

1785
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Then when I was poor,</v>

1786
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a shit when I was rich.</v>

1787
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>

1788
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 3>what now I'm going to have a boss.</v>

1789
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Like it's weird,</v>

1790
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 3>like you don't have to do that.</v>

1791
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Just do things that you're doing now.</v>

1792
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm saying that I know,</v>

1793
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:56.980
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I'm saying Joel,</v>

1794
00:42:56.981 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 3>like I don't want like,</v>

1795
00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.230
<v Speaker 3>well what's a bet?</v>

1796
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it this way.</v>

1797
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefit of you doing something on television other than vice,</v>

1798
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.350
<v Speaker 3>which is an awesome show and Anthony Bourdain show,</v>

1799
00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:07.184
<v Speaker 3>which is an awesome,</v>

1800
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 3>things like that is great,</v>

1801
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 3>but what's the benefit of you doing a television?</v>

1802
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:12.021
<v Speaker 3>Do you need more money?</v>

1803
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:13.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what to do with money.</v>

1804
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just like to do projects.</v>

1805
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just for me like I dunno,</v>

1806
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I just film this pilot where just,</v>

1807
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:21.951
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1808
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.671
<v Speaker 3>it's not for the money.</v>

1809
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't even have to pay me anything.</v>

1810
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:28.100
<v Speaker 3>But it's like I get to fly somewhere and I get to like,</v>

1811
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 3>like doing a show like this.</v>

1812
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.960
<v Speaker 3>We can say anything we want or we could talk about like,</v>

1813
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.111
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1814
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:34.790

1815
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:36.830
<v Speaker 3>but this is like making it happen.</v>

1818
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 3>but you could do that.</v>

1819
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.471
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1820
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:41.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the thing with the publishing,</v>

1821
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.300
<v Speaker 3>it's so much easier for like when I showed up on board,</v>

1876
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like a weird feeling to go to like a Denzel movie or Liam Neeson movie and</v>

1877
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting there and you're like,</v>

1878
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:15.894
<v Speaker 3>this is shitty,</v>

1879
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>

1880
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 3>it's so much money behind it.</v>

1881
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 3>How did it even get made?</v>

1882
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.821
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1883
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Or you're sitting in an editing room and,</v>

1884
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 3>and that you're putting in,</v>

1885
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 3>you're working on the show and you're like,</v>

1886
00:45:26.011 --> 00:45:26.401
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1887
00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 3>that ports are really funny.</v>

1888
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:27.900
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1889
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 3>that's never going to be on TV.</v>

1890
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1891
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Because everyone in this room agrees.</v>

1892
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the funniest thing.</v>

1893
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 3>It'll never be on TV.</v>

1894
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1895
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Because of a coasts soap commercial is going to pull their ads if you do that,</v>

1896
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.370
<v Speaker 3>that's half the best shit I've ever said on fear factor.</v>

1897
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.243
<v Speaker 3>Never made it to the air.</v>

1898
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1899
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Cause I would fuck with the contestants and save ridiculous shit.</v>

1900
00:45:46.341 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Like to see that wasn't going to be on the air.</v>

1901
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see that.</v>

1902
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 3>But you got to understand that that's not what they're trying to do.</v>

1903
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:52.561
<v Speaker 3>Their,</v>

1904
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 3>their business is not the business of artistic expression.</v>

1905
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1906
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Businesses,</v>

1907
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 3>the business of making money.</v>

1908
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 3>What's the best way to optimize our chance to make making money?</v>

1909
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 3>You got to get a real cookie cutter bullshit television show,</v>

1910
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:02.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1911
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.123
<v Speaker 3>You know these,</v>

1912
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.270
<v Speaker 3>but they're saying there's,</v>

1913
00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 3>then there's no audience for a fear factor type show where Joe Fox with the</v>

1914
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.360
<v Speaker 3>contestants there is,</v>

1915
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that forum.</v>

1916
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.750
<v Speaker 3>That forum has already been established.</v>

1917
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 3>It's already locked down.</v>

1918
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 3>It's already censored.</v>

1919
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.270
<v Speaker 3>But what you're doing on the,</v>

1920
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet is a wild wet,</v>

1921
00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 3>like this podcast,</v>

1922
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 3>it has no boss.</v>

1923
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no one to tell us what we can talk about.</v>

1924
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>We can do whatever we want.</v>

1925
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1926
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's because it's on the Internet.</v>

1927
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 3>You could do that same sort of thing and running to what I do,</v>

1928
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:29.221
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

1929
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:30.054
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

1930
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.721
<v Speaker 3>you're on.</v>

1931
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1932
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1933
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 3>whatever the network UFC is on.</v>

1934
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:34.531
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>

1935
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 3>anytime you do TV stuff,</v>

1936
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.361
<v Speaker 3>do they ever go,</v>

1937
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

1938
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I've had a few talks about some fucking crazy shit on your last show.</v>

1939
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 3>You've got to take that episode down.</v>

1940
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1941
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:42.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1942
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.013
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1943
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:43.853
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>

1944
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 3>I bet we've,</v>

1945
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 3>there's been a few issues,</v>

1946
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 3>but I can justify the things that I've talked about.</v>

1947
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:47.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1948
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:48.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1949
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just going off on a rail you love.</v>

1950
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 3>You'll see what I'm saying.</v>

1951
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:52.771
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1952
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1953
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I've never met anyone who like knows so much and it just couldn't recall that if</v>

1954
00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:58.530
<v Speaker 3>they at one point like Dana white or whoever said,</v>

1955
00:46:58.531 --> 00:46:59.364
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

1956
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1957
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:01.290
<v Speaker 3>you're like part of UFC.</v>

1958
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Like you've been doing it forever.</v>

1959
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 3>You're podcast is just,</v>

1960
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I quit.</v>

1961
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I quit the UFC.</v>

1962
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 3>You would like that in one second.</v>

1963
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:07.891
<v Speaker 3>One second.</v>

1964
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:08.401
<v Speaker 3>You didn't say.</v>

1965
00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I love it so much that I can,</v>

1966
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I've come close a couple of times.</v>

1967
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1968
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1969
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1970
00:47:12.141 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1971
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.343
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>

1972
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.771
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1973
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:14.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm never,</v>

1974
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll never change what I do in stand up and I'll never change what I do with the</v>

1975
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:17.881
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

1976
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe that if I did that,</v>

1977
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I would be a miserable fuck if I decided.</v>

1978
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:23.430
<v Speaker 3>I believe that too.</v>

1979
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to censor the podcast and now I'm not going to have people like David</v>

1980
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:27.030
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1981
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking loose cannon.</v>

1982
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about Jackie Chan finger banging people.</v>

1983
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:30.821
<v Speaker 3>He's got an ar,</v>

1984
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 3>15 is up scores,</v>

1985
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:32.554
<v Speaker 3>girl's butthole.</v>

1986
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:33.701
<v Speaker 3>If I did that,</v>

1987
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:33.911
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1988
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I would fuck myself over.</v>

1989
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:38.670
<v Speaker 3>And plus I started doing this thing that I'd like as much as doing the UFC or</v>

1990
00:47:38.671 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 3>started doing these fight companion podcast where we sit down and we watched the</v>

1991
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:42.851
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

1992
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>We put the fight up on there and we drink and you smoke weed and we watched the</v>

1993
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 3>fight to just talk while the fights are going on.</v>

1994
00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the most fun recordings and we broadcast it.</v>

1995
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 3>You're probably having more fun doing that.</v>

1996
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 3>She gets hundreds of thousands of downloads.</v>

1997
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:56.821
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1998
00:47:56.821 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 3>See these crazy.</v>

1999
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I liked doing that almost as much as I like being there,</v>

2000
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 3>almost being there as the best.</v>

2001
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:03.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2002
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't get me wrong,</v>

2003
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I love my show and talking about everything.</v>

2004
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2005
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 3>fucking Jackie Chan,</v>

2006
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 3>like finger blasting and whatever.</v>

2007
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:13.260
<v Speaker 3>But I love getting access to fucking go to,</v>

2008
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 3>to the North Pole in and interviewing like the Norwegian army general and</v>

2009
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:18.401
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

2010
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:18.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2011
00:48:18.611 --> 00:48:19.600
<v Speaker 3>I liked that and stuff too.</v>

2012
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.823
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2013
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.023
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2014
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 3>anytime I'm putting this,</v>

2015
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.801
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2016
00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:24.131

2066
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:37.270

2067
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.450
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the funniest standup years later we could still watch repeats.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's funny as shit.</v>

2069
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.243
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

2070
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 3>the blind white racist,</v>

2071
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:48.910
<v Speaker 3>who was a black guy is still one of the greatest sketches of all the race</v>

2072
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:53.911
<v Speaker 3>trading Chinese taking the Wu Tang clan and brilliant,</v>

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 3>They started telling him he couldn't say nigger.</v>

2077
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.430
<v Speaker 3>They started telling him to stop saying it and he was like,</v>

2078
00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:01.720
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

2079
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.441
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

2080
00:50:02.441 --> 00:50:05.660
<v Speaker 3>we can get more money from advertisement if you stop saying this or you stop</v>

2081
00:50:05.661 --> 00:50:06.940
<v Speaker 3>saying that or don't do this or do it.</v>

2082
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's when he went crazy or maybe went sane and decided,</v>

2083
00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:11.471
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2084

<v Speaker 3>I got some money and they had a $50 million offer to fucking renew and this and</v>

2085
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:16.871
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2086
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:17.591
<v Speaker 3>And he just said,</v>

2087
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:18.161
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

2088
00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:19.150
<v Speaker 3>He went to Africa,</v>

2089
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 3>tried to relax and find himself and came back and he quit the fucking show and</v>

2090
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 3>he quit the show because they were turning him into something else,</v>

2091
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2092
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to take this</v>

2093
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 1>uncensored,</v>

2094
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 1>brilliant artistic mind and make him a commodity.</v>

2095
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2096
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:34.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens,</v>

2097
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2098
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>

2099
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 1>But that's their business.</v>

2100
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2101
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.993
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

2102
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like being alone with a wolf and the wolf eats you when it's hungry.</v>

2103
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's a fucking Wolf,</v>

2104
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2105
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's what they do.</v>

2106
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't be upset at a wolf for eating you.</v>

2107
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2108
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 1>that's their nature.</v>

2109
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And the nature of people that run these,</v>

2110
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 1>these production studios and networks,</v>

2112
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>They just make money and the way to make money.</v>

2113
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>How much money can you get from Toyota will Toyota,</v>

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>x more if you cut out this and don't do that,</v>

2119
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.410

2120
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll sign on for three years.</v>

2121
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:11.090

2122
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the way that shit works.</v>

2123
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:12.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2124
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's just about my nose.</v>

2125
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2126
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2127
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2128
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
00:51:15.441 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I've worked every job,</v>

2130
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I've worked in advertising,</v>

2131
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:18.441
<v Speaker 2>I've worked,</v>

2132
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I've done all that shit.</v>

2133
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>

2134
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 2>when I made the fuck you money,</v>

2135
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I sat down and I have five guys that work with me know,</v>

2136
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 2>and had a meeting and I said the point of what we do,</v>

2137
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's never been in the specialty now,</v>

2138
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 2>is to not make money.</v>

2139
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.681
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2140
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I know I could sit here and talk to you about like,</v>

2141
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 2>should you turn into subscription base or ads and listen to that.</v>

2142
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 2>We've never had ads on my show because I don't have to.</v>

2143
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.433
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2144
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 2>it would be nice if we made stuff that did make money,</v>

2145
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>but that is never,</v>

2146
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2147

<v Speaker 2>the last three years.</v>

2148
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Like everything I do just like hemorrhages and bleeds and money,</v>

2149
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.003
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2150
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I can sell one painting and make that money back in one day.</v>

2151
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:52.941
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2152
00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:53.774
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

2153
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.580
<v Speaker 2>people who have had this discussion before when the,</v>

2154

2158
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 2>this was what I would do.</v>

2159
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's like in this country and I don't want to go on a diatribe about greed</v>

2160
00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:08.631
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

2161
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like when is it enough?</v>

2162
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Like when is it like,</v>

2163
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.340
<v Speaker 2>so you got to show,</v>

2164
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2165
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 2>that like the Chappelle show and he wants to say,</v>

2166
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 2>nigger,</v>

2167
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.301
<v Speaker 2>just let them say it.</v>

2168
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Like he feels good.</v>

2169
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>He's allowed to say it.</v>

2170
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2171
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like they are not Chappelle,</v>

2172
00:52:22.991 --> 00:52:23.191
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2173
00:52:23.191 --> 00:52:27.030
<v Speaker 1>right when you have people that are not creative people or not,</v>

2174
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.510
<v Speaker 1>they're certainly not responsible for his creative vision and they started</v>

2175
00:52:30.511 --> 00:52:32.580
<v Speaker 1>interfering with it and trying to monetize it.</v>

2176
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2177
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.840
<v Speaker 1>That's when it becomes a problem when it isn't a problem is when you roll is the</v>

2178
00:52:36.841 --> 00:52:38.460
<v Speaker 1>artist is in complete control.</v>

2179
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Like a podcast,</v>

2180
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.030
<v Speaker 1>like your DVD,</v>

2181
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:41.881
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>

2182
00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:45.270
<v Speaker 1>or like Han dynasty or any of this other shit you do like all of your paintings,</v>

2183
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.770
<v Speaker 1>no one's standing over you and go,</v>

2184
00:52:46.771 --> 00:52:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Dave stopped painting tits.</v>

2185
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You know you're painting vagina,</v>

2186
00:52:49.831 --> 00:52:50.081
<v Speaker 1>you're poor,</v>

2187
00:52:50.081 --> 00:52:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you're making women objects,</v>

2188
00:52:51.451 --> 00:52:52.111
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this,</v>

2189
00:52:52.111 --> 00:52:52.944
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that.</v>

2190
00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:53.221
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2191
00:52:53.221 --> 00:52:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2192
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you can't be you.</v>

2193
00:52:55.261 --> 00:52:56.100
<v Speaker 1>If that's happening,</v>

2194
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2195
00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe some people are going to criticize you and maybe you'll take that</v>

2196
00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:02.970
<v Speaker 1>criticism to heart and it'll change your opinion about things,</v>

2197
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.920
<v Speaker 1>which is totally honest and fine.</v>

2198
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 1>If someone says,</v>

2199
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.301
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2200
00:53:06.301 --> 00:53:06.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2201
00:53:06.451 --> 00:53:06.991
<v Speaker 1>hey Dave,</v>

2202
00:53:06.991 --> 00:53:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of you painting,</v>

2203
00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:08.341
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2204
00:53:08.341 --> 00:53:08.491
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2205
00:53:08.491 --> 00:53:08.880
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2206
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2207
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:09.541
<v Speaker 1>And then you go,</v>

2208
00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you know what know?</v>

2209
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.551
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda fun.</v>

2210
00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to feel bad,</v>

2211
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:12.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2212
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to express myself.</v>

2213
00:53:14.071 --> 00:53:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I wasn't looking at it from their point of view.</v>

2214
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you can sort of alter your point of view.</v>

2215
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2216
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it's something negative about that.</v>

2217
00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:21.240
<v Speaker 1>It's part of developing,</v>

2218
00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:21.841
<v Speaker 1>maturing,</v>

2219
00:53:21.841 --> 00:53:22.441
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>

2220
00:53:22.441 --> 00:53:24.510
<v Speaker 1>taking in all sorts of different influences.</v>

2221
00:53:24.511 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of being human being,</v>

2222
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2223
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 2>But there's a big difference between that and doing it only for money.</v>

2224
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens when you get attached to a network and it's not their</v>

2225
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:33.030
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>

2226
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just what they do.</v>

2227
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's why like I've never,</v>

2228
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I've never talked to anybody about selling this thing.</v>

2229
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I would never sell this thing.</v>

2230
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 2>This is just,</v>

2231
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2232
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 2>we started this out,</v>

2233
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Brian and I go about the day that Howard's a hundred percent fuck everything up,</v>

2234
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:46.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2235
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:46.681
<v Speaker 2>They'd say,</v>

2236
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you gotta Stop Smoking Weed,</v>

2237
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2238
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>You guys got lit joints everywhere.</v>

2239
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.633
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

2240
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:51.151
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2241
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:51.601
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we,</v>

2242
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:52.434
<v Speaker 2>it's California.</v>

2243
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a medical marijuana license,</v>

2244
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:55.710
<v Speaker 2>so w and then who gives a fuck?</v>

2245
00:53:55.711 --> 00:53:56.011
<v Speaker 2>Anybody?</v>

2246
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 2>We have whiskey here all the time and we complains about that.</v>

2247
00:53:58.771 --> 00:53:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2248
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 2>what are we complaining about?</v>

2249
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 2>This w w th there's millions of people that smoke weed.</v>

2250
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 2>He told me that those people's money is not worth anything,</v>

2251
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2252
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 2>The we dollar is not real money,</v>

2253
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:08.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2254
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:13.470
<v Speaker 2>You've got to respect the fucking stoner dollar were people I pay taxes,</v>

2255
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:14.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2256
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking NRA,</v>

2257
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:16.500
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

2258
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.333
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2259
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a real problem when people try to take creative ideas and turn those</v>

2260
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 2>creative ideas into some sort of a complete monetary,</v>

2261
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:28.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2262
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.333
<v Speaker 2>venture.</v>

2263
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens when you get involved with a television show,</v>

2264
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2265
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just what it is.</v>

2266
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.320
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of compromise involved here.</v>

2267
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do that.</v>

2268
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:36.841
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem,</v>

2269
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:37.021
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2270
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:39.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I paint something,</v>

2271
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2272
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 2>some people will see it.</v>

2273
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 2>If I have it in an art gallery,</v>

2274
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to art galleries.</v>

2275
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like the spectrum of media is like this,</v>

2276
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:46.794
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2277
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like at the top is network television,</v>

2278
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.571
<v Speaker 2>like blockbuster,</v>

2279
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood movies.</v>

2280
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.000
<v Speaker 2>And then at video games,</v>

2281
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 2>or maybe video games is at the top and then it's like,</v>

2282
00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2283
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:57.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2284
00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:59.010
<v Speaker 2>music and then,</v>

2285
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2286
00:54:59.431 --> 00:54:59.941
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>

2287
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 2>comic books.</v>

2288
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.800
<v Speaker 2>And at the very bottom is art,</v>

2289
00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:02.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2290
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 2>So at the very top,</v>

2291
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 2>there's the most censorship,</v>

2292
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 2>there's the most like people with their people involved.</v>

2293
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:08.694
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2294
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:09.991
<v Speaker 2>you can't say this,</v>

2295
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:10.461
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

2296
00:55:10.461 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Dolphin Tale two,</v>

2297
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2298
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And at the very bottom is art where I can paint any,</v>

2299
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.350
<v Speaker 2>anything and no one cares.</v>

2300
00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's not literal,</v>

2301
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:20.971
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2302
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2303
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a direct connection to the art,</v>

2304
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2305
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.800
<v Speaker 2>You have your hands on the brush,</v>

2306
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2307
00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:27.330
<v Speaker 2>You're standing in front of the canvas,</v>

2308
00:55:27.331 --> 00:55:29.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no one there and it's alone in your warehouse,</v>

2309
00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 2>a solitary sport.</v>

2310
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:34.850
<v Speaker 2>No one's involved sort of like jerking off a lot of cross hatching and,</v>

2311
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and you draw this thing and it means whatever it means to whoever is,</v>

2312
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 2>to me it means this to you.</v>

2313
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 2>It means that it's like,</v>

2314
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2315
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 2>there's very little chances of you becoming like a fucking billionaire drawing</v>

2316
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:49.711
<v Speaker 2>comic books,</v>

2317
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:50.490
<v Speaker 2>but you know it,</v>

2318
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 2>you get to say,</v>

2319
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.880
<v Speaker 2>what dollar can you put on freedom like that.</v>

2320
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:59.330
<v Speaker 2>But now because this weird anomaly of where I did make like all this money doing</v>

2321
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

2322
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 2>the floodgates have opened for me to do all types of entertainment.</v>

2323
00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>And not to sound too like</v>

2324
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>artsy or whatever.</v>

2325
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.371
<v Speaker 2>I look at,</v>

2326
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 2>everything I do is art.</v>

2327
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:10.800
<v Speaker 2>I look at my podcast,</v>

2328
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 2>my TV stuff.</v>

2329
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I bring that level of expression and freedom to it.</v>

2330
00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:18.930
<v Speaker 2>And then it just is not translating well with the higher ups,</v>

2331
00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:19.411
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2332
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.244
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2333
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2334
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.800
<v Speaker 2>you could do whatever you want over here,</v>

2335
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's no higher ops pro.</v>

2336
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I know there isn't can all suck you down.</v>

2337
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no higher ups man.</v>

2339
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean this all comes down to other people in forensic influencing your,</v>

2340
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.670
<v Speaker 1>your creative vision.</v>

2341
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.030
<v Speaker 1>And you can't ever let that happen because you create a vision is what makes you</v>

2342
00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:42.540
<v Speaker 1>unique.</v>

2343
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:42.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2344
00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:45.570
<v Speaker 1>when I talked about being an artist or wanting to be an artist in high school</v>

2345
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.250
<v Speaker 1>and having this bad art teacher,</v>

2346
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2347
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I honestly do feel bad for the dude because he was really frumpy and he had a</v>

2348
00:56:52.051 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Speaker 1>gut and it's,</v>

2349
00:56:52.901 --> 00:56:54.870
<v Speaker 1>his fucking posture was bad.</v>

2350
00:56:54.871 --> 00:56:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And he just was a guy who just had no hope.</v>

2351
00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And what he said to me,</v>

2352
00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it was like I would draw this stuff and he was like,</v>

2353
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to do like you,</v>

2354
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to draw things that you don't want to draw.</v>

2355
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:05.761
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2356
00:57:05.761 --> 00:57:06.530
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2357
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.871
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2358
00:57:06.871 --> 00:57:08.280
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to have to make a living.</v>

2359
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to have to make a living,</v>

2360
00:57:09.601 --> 00:57:10.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe going to work for,</v>

2361
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2362
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.001
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>

2363
00:57:12.001 --> 00:57:12.834
<v Speaker 1>the example to use,</v>

2364
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to draw a babies for a,</v>

2365
00:57:15.591 --> 00:57:15.801
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2366
00:57:15.801 --> 00:57:17.280
<v Speaker 1>a diaper commercial.</v>

2367
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:17.821
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2368
00:57:17.821 --> 00:57:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but I want to be a comic book artist.</v>

2369
00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:20.071
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2370
00:57:20.071 --> 00:57:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

2371
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 1>may not make it as a convertible car.</v>

2372
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:22.501
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

2373
00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck this.</v>

2374
00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So my senior year I didn't even take art.</v>

2375
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the best artists in his class.</v>

2376
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.621
<v Speaker 1>There was me,</v>

2377
00:57:28.621 --> 00:57:29.450
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2378
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I think his name's John Devor.</v>

2379
00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He was really good.</v>

2380
00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And this Guy Kevin,</v>

2381
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:34.050
<v Speaker 1>who was also really good,</v>

2382
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:34.680
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2383
00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.550
<v Speaker 1>these three guys.</v>

2384
00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And we always used to draw the same style stuff.</v>

2385
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they became an artist.</v>

2386
00:57:38.461 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

2387
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:40.103
<v Speaker 1>Keep in touch with them.</v>

2388
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:40.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2389
00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:41.221
<v Speaker 1>it was high.</v>

2390
00:57:41.221 --> 00:57:42.054
<v Speaker 1>School was weird.</v>

2391
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

2392
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I was such a social misfit and high school.</v>

2393
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do a</v>

2394
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:48.090
<v Speaker 2>portfolio day where you have like a,</v>

2395
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 2>all your drawings and you go to like,</v>

2396
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2397
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.950
<v Speaker 2>like Disney or something and</v>

2398
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2399
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I never got that far with it.</v>

2400
00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even get to two as far as like applying to colleges.</v>

2401
00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:57.500
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>

2402
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.040
<v Speaker 2>when I got out of high school,</v>

2403
00:57:59.060 --> 00:57:59.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2404
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I went to art school for a year or two and then I dropped out and I was just</v>

2405
00:58:03.091 --> 00:58:03.630
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2406
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.280
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to make a living doing this?</v>

2407
00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:05.550
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2408
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 2>and I got all my best drawings and I went to,</v>

2409
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it was cal arts,</v>

2410
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:10.764
<v Speaker 2>it was like a,</v>

2411
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like a open call,</v>

2412
00:58:12.661 --> 00:58:12.991
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

2413
00:58:12.991 --> 00:58:15.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like every single animation studio,</v>

2414
00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:17.190
<v Speaker 2>every single advertising agency.</v>

2415
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.510
<v Speaker 2>And I got there and it's all these fucking kids with all their art and there's</v>

2416
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.350
<v Speaker 2>really long lines to talk to a guy that like has a pencil behind his ear and</v>

2417
00:58:25.351 --> 00:58:26.184

2419
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.070

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:55.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2445
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 2>he gives,</v>

2446
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:57.300
<v Speaker 2>he gives me his card and he goes,</v>

2447
00:58:57.301 --> 00:58:58.230
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking dope man.</v>

2448
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.150
<v Speaker 2>You should come to my office in Beverly Hills.</v>

2449
00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:03.060
<v Speaker 2>And I was like either 20 or 21.</v>

2450
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:03.894
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2451
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:04.883
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2452
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:05.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's the,</v>

2453
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.550
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the biggest advertising agencies in La.</v>

2454
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I show up there like with a tie on and everything.</v>

2455
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And as I walked down the hallway,</v>

2456
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:14.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like every movie poster.</v>

2457
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.953
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2458
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:17.243
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2459
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:18.203
<v Speaker 2>I made it.</v>

2460
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking like young and I'm going to make a living drawing.</v>

2461
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Like this is fucking crazy.</v>

2462
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.720
<v Speaker 2>So I think back then,</v>

2463
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it is now.</v>

2464
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.870
<v Speaker 2>They would have all these artists draw in.</v>

2465
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2466
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 2>the style I forgotten drew Struzan,</v>

2467
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 2>that's that star wars.</v>

2468
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:34.484
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2469
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>they got painted all the star wars.</v>

2470
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 2>These guys all draw that same style and you'd draw the movie poster and then</v>

2471
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.270
<v Speaker 2>they give that to the photographer and the photographer because you know,</v>

2472
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no art in movie posters now.</v>

2473
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2474
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.021
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2475
00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about fucking 20 years ago,</v>

2476
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sure it's different now.</v>

2477
00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 2>And it was a avalanche movie with Chris Dawn.</v>

2478
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2479
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:57.861
<v Speaker 2>Crystal.</v>

2480
00:59:57.861 --> 00:59:58.221
<v Speaker 2>Donald.</v>

2481
00:59:58.221 --> 00:59:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Crystal Donald,</v>

2482
00:59:59.061 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I think if the movie was called avalanche.</v>

2483
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2484
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I sat in the room and I was like,</v>

2485
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:03.471
<v Speaker 2>this is so cool.</v>

2486
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I get to see a movie before it came out,</v>

2487
01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2488
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.171
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2489
01:00:06.171 --> 01:00:07.760
<v Speaker 2>this movie fucking sucks.</v>

2490
01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm sitting there watching it with like six old guys with like</v>

2491
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes daily dangling out of their mouth.</v>

2492
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2493
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 2>all right guys,</v>

2494
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 2>we need avalanches.</v>

2495
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:18.920
<v Speaker 2>We need this and this and we need Chris O'donnell looking like this.</v>

2496
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2497
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

2498
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:21.171
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2499
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And I sit in a room and I draw Chris O'donnell and there's a poster,</v>

2500
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>vertical,</v>

2620
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not like hardcore,</v>

2624
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:53.821
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:54.654
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

2626
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:55.620

2627
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.453
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that.</v>

2628
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.360
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2629
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>you know what I,</v>

2630
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I've made at that young at that,</v>

2631
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2632
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2633
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 2>it's for me the saddest thing when I see young people that have already given,</v>

2634
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.410
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

2635
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.790
<v Speaker 2>that's the time you fight.</v>

2636
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the time that you should try and fail and try again.</v>

2637
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like when you get old you're like,</v>

2638
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 2>at least I tried.</v>

2639
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.633
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out,</v>

2640
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2641
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.330

<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

2643

<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

2660
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.450
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2661
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>it's really important that you try to figure out what is unique in your head and</v>

2662
01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that what is in your head,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to start my own publishing company.</v>

2668
01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:58.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm just going to do whatever I want,</v>

2669
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 2>knowing that it's not gonna make any money.</v>

2670
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.860
<v Speaker 2>And then what always happens is because it's so unique and whatever,</v>

2671
01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 2>it does make money.</v>

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.970
<v Speaker 1>my uncle's an artist.</v>

2731
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2732
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all just,</v>

2733
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:28.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2734
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it's in the family.</v>

2735
01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You know what I think about when I see that it's like,</v>

2736
01:05:31.081 --> 01:05:31.950
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen,</v>

2737
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.020
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound bad,</v>

2738
01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:35.400
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever seen Hitler's art?</v>

2739
01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:36.511
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2740
01:05:36.511 --> 01:05:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2741
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2742
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:37.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2743
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2744
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:38.903
<v Speaker 2>it's good,</v>

2745
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's very like you would think a guy that is a murderer and like his</v>

2746
01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:43.141
<v Speaker 2>murdered,</v>

2747
01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>like millions of people would have like a more hardcore,</v>

2748
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2749
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's great if you're six years,</v>

2750
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.010
<v Speaker 2>like first of all the thing Joe just show me,</v>

2751
01:05:50.011 --> 01:05:51.510
<v Speaker 2>look like a grown adult.</v>

2752
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It freaks me out.</v>

2753
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>The the mountains and the snow in the mountains</v>

2754
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.600
<v Speaker 2>when you're at that age,</v>

2755
01:05:57.601 --> 01:05:58.470
<v Speaker 2>like the tiger woods,</v>

2756
01:05:58.471 --> 01:05:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan,</v>

2757
01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.450
<v Speaker 2>like young person and like you're,</v>

2758
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.291
<v Speaker 2>you're learning,</v>

2759
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.550
<v Speaker 2>you're like Picasso or whatever.</v>

2760
01:06:02.551 --> 01:06:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Like you're learning,</v>

2761
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:04.441
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2762
01:06:04.441 --> 01:06:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm just technique techniques and just getting all that stuff down perspective.</v>

2763
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.920
<v Speaker 2>You get it down and you're like,</v>

2764
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:11.251
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2765
01:06:11.251 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I can paint a tree with all the highlights off the leaves and the dew drops in</v>

2766
01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.920
<v Speaker 2>and that's great.</v>

2767
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.300
<v Speaker 2>That's like the time to do that.</v>

2768
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.330
<v Speaker 2>But then at some point you have to be like,</v>

2769
01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:22.170
<v Speaker 2>what's inside me?</v>

2770
01:06:22.171 --> 01:06:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Is it really a landscape or do I want to paint some crazy shit and I,</v>

2771
01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2772
01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:27.180
<v Speaker 2>and so like she's great.</v>

2773
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:30.300
<v Speaker 2>She has the potential like everyone has the potential.</v>

2774
01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2775
01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.980
<v Speaker 2>But they get to a point,</v>

2776
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like you discovered fighting,</v>

2777
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>but if you never got into fighting,</v>

2778
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I think you would have been a great artist doing,</v>

2779
01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:37.860
<v Speaker 2>you know all your werewolves</v>

2780
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.000
<v Speaker 1>well why would have enjoyed it?</v>

2781
01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I still love comic book movies and I Love Comic Book Art.</v>

2782
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I love those like really glossy comic book magazines and stuff.</v>

2783
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:50.160
<v Speaker 2>So like when I see Hitler's are nicely like these landscapes and just shit,</v>

2784
01:06:50.161 --> 01:06:50.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm like dude,</v>

2785
01:06:50.911 --> 01:06:54.540
<v Speaker 2>if you like went as hardcore and your art as you did with killing people,</v>

2786
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.220
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you would have never become a,</v>

2787
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2788
01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>did you see the thing that was out recently about Hitler taking math like Hitler</v>

2789
01:07:00.441 --> 01:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>apparently was like really in the math sounds about right.</v>

2790
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Sounds about right.</v>

2791
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2792
01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>There was some screaming and he was on Meth,</v>

2793
01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the adult rent.</v>

2794
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>He was apparently a hypochondriac and he took a bunch of different medications.</v>

2795
01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>But one of them is he,</v>

2796
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:15.963
<v Speaker 1>he took math.</v>

2797
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2798
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2799
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Which totally makes sense.</v>

2800
01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2801
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

2802
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they say with math is that a completely corroded your</v>

2803
01:07:22.131 --> 01:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

2804
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Your judgment just goes out the window.</v>

2805
01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He just killed Jews.</v>

2806
01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.173
<v Speaker 1>Each kills</v>

2807
01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>those crazy speeches.</v>

2808
01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>He's probably meth to the tits.</v>

2809
01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2810
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Probably didn't have any nerves at all.</v>

2811
01:07:34.941 --> 01:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>That's why he was so intense and fucking hair flopping around furious anger in</v>

2812
01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>his eyes.</v>

2813
01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:39.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2814
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.680
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2815
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.513
<v Speaker 1>you watch one of his,</v>

2816
01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2817
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was on crystal meth and I crazy.</v>

2818
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.651
<v Speaker 1>What's that website?</v>

2819
01:07:45.651 --> 01:07:46.484
<v Speaker 1>Is that USA Today?</v>

2820
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2821
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:47.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2822
01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>according to a 47 page,</v>

2823
01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't read that bull.</v>

2824
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

2825
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2826
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Military dossier.</v>

2827
01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>He used to take bull semen,</v>

2828
01:07:54.801 --> 01:07:55.401
<v Speaker 1>morphine,</v>

2829
01:07:55.401 --> 01:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizers,</v>

2830
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>bull semen.</v>

2831
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2832
01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that did anything for him.</v>

2833
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>But the crystal Meth,</v>

2834
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>a pill that contain crystal meth and other drugs depending on Hitler's.</v>

2835
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a Kevorkian art?</v>

2836
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.223
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2837
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

2838
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:11.451
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

2839
01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2840

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2843
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but like makes you sort of rethink like his motivation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Looking at Kevorkian art.</v>

2850
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Pull up some of the more dark,</v>

2851

<v Speaker 2>you have to stand up,</v>

2901
01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:40.830
<v Speaker 2>stand up comedy every night.</v>

2902
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you think like art is like the best?</v>

2903
01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Like not for like uh,</v>

2904
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.040
<v Speaker 2>like monetizing reasons or fans or whatever.</v>

2905
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Just when I draw something and I expressed them and I don't have to like write</v>

2906

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.380
<v Speaker 2>it captures exactly what's going on.</v>

2910
01:09:58.650 --> 01:09:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that like the best feeling?</v>

2911
01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know what's going on in the Kevorkian Shit,</v>

2912
01:10:02.191 --> 01:10:03.710
<v Speaker 2>but that must guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it must have had so much shit that like that release of like painting shit like</v>

2914
01:10:07.741 --> 01:10:08.551
<v Speaker 2>that is just like,</v>

2915
01:10:08.551 --> 01:10:09.810
<v Speaker 2>it's so therapeutic to me.</v>

2916
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:10.441
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

2917
01:10:10.441 --> 01:10:13.440
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely something beautiful about creating something cause you know</v>

2918
01:10:13.441 --> 01:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that like it didn't exist before you put your attention to it.</v>

2919
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>You put your attention to that piece of paper or that piece of clay or whatever</v>

2920
01:10:20.491 --> 01:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you're creating and you,</v>

2921
01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you made something out of it and it existed because you put your attention to it</v>

2922
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>and whatever it is inside of you,</v>

2923
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2924
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:29.281
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

2925
01:10:29.281 --> 01:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Creativity is undefined,</v>

2926
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2927
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>you're God creating something out of nothing.</v>

2928
01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:34.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2929
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>like there's nothing here and you create it.</v>

2930
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And then like just not to harp on it or sound,</v>

2931
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2932
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just with the young people,</v>

2933
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:43.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2934
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:46.820
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm sure young people talk to you all the time and I don't,</v>

2935
01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sound delusional saying,</v>

2936
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:48.471
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2937
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:49.970
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for you or guys like Joe.</v>

2938
01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:54.860
<v Speaker 2>But the saddest thing is when you enslave yourself at such a young age and throw</v>

2939
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:56.120
<v Speaker 2>yourself into like,</v>

2940
01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:56.451
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2941
01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:58.370
<v Speaker 2>there's people that need to be parking meter cops,</v>

2942
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 2>there's people that need to be working at an ad agency,</v>

2943
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't need to be you.</v>

2944
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to be me,</v>

2945
01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but it needs to be the person who's listening to me that I'm saying it doesn't</v>

2946
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:06.771
<v Speaker 1>need to be you.</v>

2947
01:11:06.771 --> 01:11:07.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to be you.</v>

2948
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking people,</v>

2949
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2950
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2951
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And somebody will fall prey to that trap.</v>

2952
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:12.411
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2953
01:11:12.411 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>this is like my best advice on</v>

2954
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.611
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing.</v>

2955
01:11:14.611 --> 01:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2956
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2957
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>there's people that fall in that trap.</v>

2958
01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're young,</v>

2959
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.240
<v Speaker 2>you can fuck up and you'll still be young like and then try again.</v>

2960
01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I get,</v>

2961
01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2962
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have a lot of people that are like your fans.</v>

2963
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

2964
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you did it and I,</v>

2965
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 2>you're my idol and I worship you and this and that and so you did it.</v>

2966
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:32.100
<v Speaker 2>So that makes me feel like I can do it.</v>

2967
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.660
<v Speaker 2>And my whole thing with that is</v>

2968
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 2>like the whole like follow your dreams,</v>

2969
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 2>definitely follow your dreams.</v>

2970
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>You know like definitely go for it.</v>

2971
01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Like your dreams and everything.</v>

2972
01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>But like what gets my dick really hard,</v>

2973
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like when I'm at Ihub and the guy takes my pancake order and he's like,</v>

2974
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2975
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 2>we have three new different syrups for that.</v>

2976
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And like if you do this,</v>

2977
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a better combo.</v>

2978
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And he knows his job and he runs to get me the syrup and I'm like,</v>

2979
01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 2>this guy maybe doesn't want to be,</v>

2980
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I hope a waiter for his whole life,</v>

2981
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 2>but the time he's here,</v>

2982
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 2>he's passionate about it.</v>

2983
01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 2>He's bringing all of his energy to it.</v>

2984
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 2>And then if I hop waiters and ultimately what ends up doing,</v>

2985
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:09.660
<v Speaker 2>he's going to bring that,</v>

2986
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2987
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:10.883
<v Speaker 2>it's like just,</v>

2988
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.873
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2989
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Try to do,</v>

2990
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 2>not everyone's going to be the best artist.</v>

2991
01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone's going to be the best actor.</v>

2992
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Not every.</v>

2993
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:21.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like so when your dreams get crushed or you know,</v>

2994
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like be fucking awesome at your job even if it's not what you like wanted</v>

2995
01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:25.741
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

2996
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:26.574
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>

2997
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2998
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I think about chefs a lot now because I'm friends with a lot of celebrity chefs.</v>

2999
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>That's not a fucking that you're serving.</v>

3000
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:34.630
<v Speaker 2>You make food for people.</v>

3001
01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not a glamorous thing,</v>

3002
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:40.140
<v Speaker 2>which like my friends like David Chang and board and it's becoming more glam</v>

3003
01:12:40.141 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 2>because they took a shitty job where it's like,</v>

3004
01:12:42.631 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3005
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I got to stand on my feet and where these weird clog shoes all day and all</v>

3006
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:47.560
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3007
01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3008
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.650
<v Speaker 2>this is too salty and take it back.</v>

3009
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like a shitty job.</v>

3010
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:52.110
<v Speaker 2>You're like a servant.</v>

3011
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:56.010
<v Speaker 2>But they took that job and they made it glamorous.</v>

3012
01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:59.580
<v Speaker 2>They fucking brought their fucking rockstar passion energy to it.</v>

3013
01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 2>And now it's like,</v>

3014
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:01.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3015
01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I went to a chef convention,</v>

3016
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3017
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:03.241
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>

3018
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.220
<v Speaker 2>mad symposium in Copenhagen and I,</v>

3019
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's guys with like knife tattoos and weird facial piercings and I'm</v>

3020
01:13:11.161 --> 01:13:11.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3021
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 2>is this like a rockstar convention or something?</v>

3022
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And so there are artists.</v>

3023
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:15.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3024
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3025
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 2>and they brought that to that.</v>

3026
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:17.940
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm just like,</v>

3027
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 2>be fucking dope at your job,</v>

3028
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:20.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

3029
01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I think being a chef is being an artist.</v>

3030
01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:23.461
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3031
01:13:23.461 --> 01:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it's cuisine is a form of art and the different flavors that you can</v>

3032
01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:29.670
<v Speaker 2>definitely in someone's mouth,</v>

3033
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:30.360
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

3034
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.230
<v Speaker 2>there's an art to that.</v>

3035
01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Without it.</v>

3036
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I really learned that from Bordain watching a show and the passion that he has</v>

3037
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:38.450
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

3038
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 2>like eat,</v>

3039
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.020
<v Speaker 2>it's contagious.</v>

3040
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:40.520
<v Speaker 2>It makes you,</v>

3041
01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:40.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3042
01:13:40.781 --> 01:13:43.350
<v Speaker 2>guys like [inaudible] brought that to that brought to your attention.</v>

3043
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And so now it's like you meet kids that are like,</v>

3044
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a chef when I grow up.</v>

3045
01:13:46.861 --> 01:13:47.694
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that,</v>

3046
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 2>that really didn't exist before.</v>

3047
01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.244
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3048
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>everybody has something that they're really into.</v>

3049
01:13:53.281 --> 01:13:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Some people are really into riding horses.</v>

3050
01:13:55.081 --> 01:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't give a fuck about riding horses.</v>

3051
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Some people are really into,</v>

3052
01:13:58.890 --> 01:13:59.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3053
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>

3054
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3055
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's a matter of what your personality fits best with and trying to pursue</v>

3056
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3057
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the most insidious things where it happens to young kids is not just the</v>

3058
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 2>compromising early and falling into a slave</v>

3059
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.383
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

3060
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's being saddled with debt,</v>

3061
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3062
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Being saddled with debt right off the bat,</v>

3063
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that it happens so fucking often,</v>

3064
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:21.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3065
01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3066
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So often kids go to school and then they accrue fucking $300,000 in school debt</v>

3067
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>and then they get out and they're fucked.</v>

3068
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.100
<v Speaker 1>They're slaying.</v>

3069
01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>They almost did it to themselves.</v>

3070
01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3071
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3072
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.250
<v Speaker 2>like someone will tell them like,</v>

3073
01:14:34.251 --> 01:14:34.650
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3074
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.400
<v Speaker 2>college is in four years now it's more like five to six years.</v>

3075
01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.820
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be like a quarter mill in the hole when you get out and we're</v>

3076
01:14:40.821 --> 01:14:42.980
<v Speaker 2>not going to teach you anything here that's going to teach you how to make</v>

3077
01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:43.430
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

3078
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:46.280
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to know a lot about psychology,</v>

3079
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're doing something technologically paced by the time you get</v>

3080
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:51.610
<v Speaker 1>out years later.</v>

3081
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:52.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3082
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:54.610
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of these professors are like dinosaurs.</v>

3083
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 2>They're like teaching you some shit that's like irrelevant now.</v>

3084
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3085
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that for sure.</v>

3086
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's just also the idea of wanting to figure out what you want to do with</v>

3087
01:15:03.761 --> 01:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>your life and having to choose at 18 right?</v>

3088
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You're a baby when you're 18 years old,</v>

3089
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you're a baby,</v>

3090
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:09.241
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3091
01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:09.481
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3092
01:15:09.481 --> 01:15:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you've only been alive for 18 years.</v>

3093
01:15:11.951 --> 01:15:12.581
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

3094
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:15.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not even anything is your first and your,</v>

3095
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years is the first year you've been able to make your own</v>

3096
01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:18.660
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

3097
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3098
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden you have to choose the course of your life.</v>

3099
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got your parents harping,</v>

3100
01:15:23.231 --> 01:15:23.321
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3101
01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:23.950
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

3102
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you should be a Dr. David,</v>

3103
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 1>who should be a lawyer.</v>

3104
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

3105
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.301
<v Speaker 1>you should do this.</v>

3106
01:15:28.301 --> 01:15:29.430
<v Speaker 1>You should do that for the,</v>

3107
01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:31.150
<v Speaker 1>for the immigrant experience a little bit hard.</v>

3108
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean every,</v>

3109
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.570
<v Speaker 2>well everyone who was an American as an immigrant,</v>

3110
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.850
<v Speaker 2>so it's like that is that experience,</v>

3111
01:15:37.851 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 2>the guilt level for the Koreans.</v>

3112
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:44.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like I escaped from North Korea for you to stick a gun in a girl's butt</v>

3113
01:15:46.831 --> 01:15:47.664
<v Speaker 2>hole and like,</v>

3114
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3115
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:48.821
<v Speaker 2>they use that.</v>

3116
01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 2>They're like the tanks and the fucking bombs.</v>

3117
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I had to dodge for you to come here and do Hong Dynasty.</v>

3118
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Like did your family come from North Korea?</v>

3119
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3120
01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:57.634
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't say that.</v>

3121
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.660
<v Speaker 2>That's more dramatic.</v>

3122
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure someone,</v>

3123
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:00.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3124
01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:01.190
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3125
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 2>my dad was the fucking crazy escape story.</v>

3126
01:16:03.461 --> 01:16:04.271
<v Speaker 2>My mom has it too.</v>

3127
01:16:04.271 --> 01:16:05.104
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3128
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.071
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts,</v>

3129
01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:06.550
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3130
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:07.620
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3131
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:09.190
<v Speaker 2>since you brought up debt,</v>

3132
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 2>can I speak for it for one second?</v>

3133
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3134
01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:12.243
<v Speaker 2>but up debt,</v>

3135
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 2>being in debt or whatever.</v>

3136
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:16.200
<v Speaker 2>So I used to,</v>

3137
01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I used to do this show a thumbs up.</v>

3138
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I just did the fourth season a year ago.</v>

3139
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It's still not out yet.</v>

3140
01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>But what is it?</v>

3141
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just me hitchhiking across America is still not out.</v>

3142
01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:25.720
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3143
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3144
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it's three seasons of it are out on vice and then the fourth one is like still</v>

3145
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>being edited or whatever.</v>

3146
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:35.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole premise of the show is hitchhike from once point a to point B.</v>

3147
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3148
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and you can't spend money on any,</v>

3149
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:39.190
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3150
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just to show,</v>

3151
01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:41.801
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

3152
01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to have your life.</v>

3153
01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:43.481
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to travel.</v>

3154

3316
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3317
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 2>since I went to Rehab for gamble gambling and had my heart attack and all that</v>

3318
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:00.260
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

3319
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.250
<v Speaker 2>when did this happen?</v>

3320
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 2>35 so three years ago now,</v>

3321
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.510
<v Speaker 2>he went to Rehab for gambling.</v>

3322
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't stop man.</v>

3323
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3324
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3325
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 2>and what they had done with the limits,</v>

3326
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:10.891
<v Speaker 2>because in Vegas,</v>

3327
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:11.461
<v Speaker 2>like the most,</v>

3328
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you can bet on certain things.</v>

3329
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like 25,000 a hand on blackjack or whatever is,</v>

3330
01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:18.690
<v Speaker 2>they raised it for me because they knew how much money I was worth and I could</v>

3331
01:20:18.691 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 2>bet a quarter million a hand on project.</v>

3332
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 2>So it could go pretty quickly.</v>

3333
01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3334

3589
01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 2>if I interview a Norwegian general or something and he says something,</v>

3590
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 2>we fact check it.</v>

3679
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:14.791
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Michael Jordan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3693
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.660
<v Speaker 2>And so it was our third show of the day and my show is like chaotic.</v>

3694
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3695
01:29:45.091 --> 01:29:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you've been on and there's like six people talking over each other at the same</v>

3696
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3697
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying to tell the story and no one was opinion attention.</v>

3698
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And I don't listen.</v>

3699
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Like when this show ends,</v>

3700
01:29:53.071 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 2>do you listen to yourself?</v>

3701
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:54.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3702
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I never listened to myself.</v>

3703
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.720
<v Speaker 2>And that was the one time where I was like,</v>

3704
01:29:57.721 --> 01:29:57.901
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3705
01:29:57.901 --> 01:29:58.800
<v Speaker 2>these guys aren't listening.</v>

3706
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.090
<v Speaker 2>So I exaggerated a little eye every,</v>

3707
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.550
<v Speaker 2>all the bad shit that happened to me.</v>

3708
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:03.151
<v Speaker 2>I deserved it.</v>

3709
01:30:03.151 --> 01:30:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I never should have told the story the way I told it.</v>

3710
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I should've never like whatever.</v>

3711
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3712
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:10.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3713
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

3714
01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3715
01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:11.701
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3716
01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:12.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a rapist.</v>

3717
01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:13.460
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like,</v>

3718
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.621
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3719
01:30:13.621 --> 01:30:14.490

01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never like,</v>

3723
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 2>and then people started bumping me in with Terry Richardson.</v>

3724
01:30:20.161 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3725
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:24.060

3871
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you ever would.</v>

3872
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:49.620
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

3873
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.081
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

3874
01:33:50.081 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>

3875
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it could be wrong,</v>

3876
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:56.710
<v Speaker 2>but I listened to your explanation of it and I know what it's like when you're</v>

3877
01:33:56.711 --> 01:34:00.010
<v Speaker 2>doing a podcast because sometimes you just trying to be entertaining.</v>

3878
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I seen people exaggerate stories.</v>

3879
01:34:01.961 --> 01:34:02.321
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3880
01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3881
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been on podcasts before where people have told stories that I know what</v>

3882
01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 2>really happened and they're trying to make it better by adding a little to it.</v>

3883
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:10.840
<v Speaker 2>But the way you did it,</v>

3884
01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:11.910
<v Speaker 2>if you any crazy.</v>

3885
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3886
01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:14.890
<v Speaker 2>If you and me went through some crazy shit and like we were like,</v>

3887
01:34:14.891 --> 01:34:17.500
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it without getting in trouble.</v>

3888
01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Then we have to change some details and dance around and turn into a rape</v>

3889
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.813
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>

3890
01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.310
<v Speaker 2>But to the people that listen to it,</v>

3891
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I kind of see their point,</v>

3892
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:29.501
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3893
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:31.830
<v Speaker 2>when I went to 100% when I went back and heard it,</v>

3894
01:34:31.831 --> 01:34:32.664
<v Speaker 2>it sounds horrible.</v>

3895
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3896
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was like,</v>

3897
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.590
<v Speaker 2>everyone who like got down on me,</v>

3898
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

3899
01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 2>like I deserve like knowing who I am and then like hearing like that thing,</v>

3900
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:42.791
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3901
01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:43.271
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

3902
01:34:43.271 --> 01:34:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that sounds bad.</v>

3903
01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Like so,</v>

3904
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3905
01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:46.990
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

3906
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.651
<v Speaker 2>my defense,</v>

3907
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:49.000
<v Speaker 2>my delusional defense of like,</v>

3908
01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:49.901
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't do it.</v>

3909
01:34:49.901 --> 01:34:52.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like if I said anything,</v>

3910
01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it just sounds,</v>

3911
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 2>anytime anyone sounds tries to defend themselves,</v>

3912
01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:56.801
<v Speaker 2>it sounds horrible.</v>

3913
01:34:56.801 --> 01:34:57.111
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3914
01:34:57.111 --> 01:34:57.591
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3915
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3916
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3917
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand what you're saying.</v>

3918
01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3919
01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3920
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:03.350
<v Speaker 1>and I understand it from a point of someone who does podcasts too,</v>

3921
01:35:03.351 --> 01:35:07.940
<v Speaker 1>that you can say things sometimes that you don't mean it even you just trying to</v>

3922
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:12.970
<v Speaker 1>be fun or titillating or in your case trying to be really controversial to</v>

3923
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.550
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

3924
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>change the tone of the room.</v>

3925
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>You just fucked up.</v>

3926
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:17.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3927
01:35:17.811 --> 01:35:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Patrice O'Neal was talking about something once we was talking about people</v>

3928
01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>trying to be funny that sometimes people say like really offensive things,</v>

3929
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to be funny and it fails and they're a horrible person and</v>

3930
01:35:28.701 --> 01:35:28.911
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3931
01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:32.150
<v Speaker 1>but if they said something that wasn't offensive and funny and it,</v>

3932
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.730
<v Speaker 1>and it succeeded and made you laugh,</v>

3933
01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it's comes from the same place.</v>

3934
01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It comes from this place of trying to make something entertaining.</v>

3935
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3936
01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:42.650
<v Speaker 1>we say make mistakes when you're doing things live.</v>

3937
01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:42.991
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3938
01:35:42.991 --> 01:35:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you've been on our show and then once I,</v>

3939
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:44.821
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3940
01:35:44.821 --> 01:35:45.361
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

3941
01:35:45.361 --> 01:35:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I need to go back to the North Korea America thing.</v>

3942
01:35:47.431 --> 01:35:48.264
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3943
01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not a murderer.</v>

3944
01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not a racist.</v>

3945
01:35:51.241 --> 01:35:54.120
<v Speaker 2>So why can't I say like aids jokes or it's like,</v>

3946
01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.021
<v Speaker 2>I get it now.</v>

3947
01:35:55.021 --> 01:35:55.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3948
01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:55.561

<v Speaker 2>well you are,</v>

3950
01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you have a responsibility.</v>

3951
01:35:57.121 --> 01:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>People will hear that and think,</v>

3952
01:35:58.290 --> 01:35:58.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3953
01:35:58.591 --> 01:36:01.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like when I'm with asa and we're not on the air,</v>

3954
01:36:01.141 --> 01:36:02.910
<v Speaker 2>and we were just saying the worst shit to each other.</v>

3955
01:36:02.911 --> 01:36:03.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3956
01:36:03.151 --> 01:36:03.970
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

3957
01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:06.010
<v Speaker 1>You're also dealing with Asa Akira,</v>

3958
01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.050
<v Speaker 1>who's like one of the most hardcore of hardcore porn stars,</v>

3959
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:10.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3960
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So like her tolerance level and that's what she thinks is funny and</v>

3961
01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:16.010
<v Speaker 1>controversial is so different.</v>

3962
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3963

<v Speaker 2>that's what has happened is hanging out.</v>

3964
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not blaming us.</v>

3965
01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:23.900

<v Speaker 2>like a lot of disturbed people.</v>

3967
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.400

4127
01:39:40.801 --> 01:39:41.041

4128
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4129
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:43.800
<v Speaker 2>and cycle you're thing is psychological.</v>

4130
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:44.600
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4131
01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.210

01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

4135
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Is it something like where you feel like the girl doesn't deserve your calm or</v>

4136
01:39:49.411 --> 01:39:50.130
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

4137
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 2>So I made a whole new TV show for him called girlfriend experience and I'm</v>

4138
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 2>sending him to Columbia and I paid a model like that.</v>

4139
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Looks like Sophia Vergara Bill.</v>

4140
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're listening like you know,</v>

4141
01:40:00.901 --> 01:40:02.010
<v Speaker 2>not the most attractive guy,</v>

4142
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:04.080
<v Speaker 2>like a short,</v>

4143
01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:05.970
<v Speaker 2>like I'm very fat,</v>

4144
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:09.180
<v Speaker 2>nerdy looking Asian guy with a girl.</v>

4145
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Like basically I told the girl,</v>

4146
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you can't ever talk about money.</v>

4147
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 2>You have to trick them and pretend like you're his girlfriend for 30 days and</v>

4148
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:17.830
<v Speaker 2>then see if he finally come.</v>

4149
01:40:17.831 --> 01:40:19.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the whole TV show.</v>

4150
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>If you fuck 30 hookers and you don't basically,</v>

4151
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.273
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

4152
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:24.360
<v Speaker 2>that's my life now.</v>

4153
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.590
<v Speaker 2>So that feels normal.</v>

4154
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So when I talk about this shit with you are my friends,</v>

4155
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.011
<v Speaker 2>it's like whatever.</v>

4156
01:40:29.011 --> 01:40:29.491
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

4157
01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We just talked about Asian guy that works in,</v>

4158
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:34.230
<v Speaker 2>in women's panties to come in and then you're like,</v>

4159
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:34.681
<v Speaker 2>oh wait,</v>

4160
01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:36.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe this isn't polite dinner conversation.</v>

4161
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like my world views a little bit skewed and it's a little,</v>

4162
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4163
01:40:40.661 --> 01:40:41.494
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4164
01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4165
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:43.441
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4166
01:40:43.441 --> 01:40:44.274
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4167
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4168
01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the best person to bring to like a dinner party with wives and stuff,</v>

4169
01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:49.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4170
01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:51.090
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>

4171
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:52.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

4172
01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely not polite</v>

4173
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.091
<v Speaker 3>dinner conversation.</v>

4174
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:55.331
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4175
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:56.164
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

4176
01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

4177
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.521
<v Speaker 3>And you've been on our show.</v>

4178
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:58.354
<v Speaker 3>It's like when,</v>

4179
01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.540
<v Speaker 3>when you go in the room and the doors close and then everyone just starts</v>

4180
01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:02.740
<v Speaker 3>fucking did you just like,</v>

4181
01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

4182
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you forget that another world exists.</v>

4183
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4184
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.210
<v Speaker 3>when everybody starts talking about crazy shit.</v>

4185
01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4186
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 3>You sort of like get into that mode and it becomes acceptable.</v>

4187
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're around people that never swear and someone walks in the room and</v>

4188
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:14.591
<v Speaker 3>says fuck,</v>

4189
01:41:14.591 --> 01:41:14.831
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

4190
01:41:14.831 --> 01:41:15.664
<v Speaker 3>oh right.</v>

4191
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

4192
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:16.841
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4193
01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 3>But if you're around people that are constantly swearing,</v>

4194
01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:19.750
<v Speaker 3>you don't even,</v>

4195
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:21.470
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even like this conversation here,</v>

4196
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but nothing,</v>

4197
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 3>nothing's registered.</v>

4198
01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4199
01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:27.370
<v Speaker 3>And you'll save this fucking this or that means nothing.</v>

4200
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 3>But if the president said it in a speech,</v>

4201
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you personally be like,</v>

4202
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:31.121

01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:32.140
<v Speaker 3>he just said fuck.</v>

4204
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.460
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>

4205
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:34.140
<v Speaker 3>you get used to,</v>

4206
01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe I gave myself too much credit.</v>

4207
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4208

01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:49.774
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

4302
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4303
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:52.700
<v Speaker 3>but they'll figure it out eventually that sale.</v>

4304
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

01:43:54.201 --> 01:43:54.561
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4307
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.550
<v Speaker 3>you're still doing the same shit.</v>

4308
01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.413
<v Speaker 3>Can I say something</v>

4309
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:57.403
<v Speaker 2>that it's like,</v>

4310
01:43:58.700 --> 01:43:59.610
<v Speaker 2>if someone's not a rape,</v>

4311
01:43:59.611 --> 01:43:59.871
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

4312
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

4313
01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.293
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4314
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:05.360
<v Speaker 2>it's such a huge fucking thing to call someone that when they're not,</v>

4315
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:05.811
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

4316
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you're literally like ruining that guy's life.</v>

4317
01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.990
<v Speaker 3>But how would they know that you're not a rapist?</v>

4318
01:44:09.991 --> 01:44:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

4319
01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:11.730
<v Speaker 3>They would assume that you are,</v>

4320
01:44:11.731 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 3>I saw people that I know call you a rapist,</v>

4321
01:44:14.491 --> 01:44:14.910
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

4322
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:15.121
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4323
01:44:15.121 --> 01:44:15.680
<v Speaker 3>this is a man.</v>

4324
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't even know me.</v>

4325
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4326
01:44:17.670 --> 01:44:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but they're basing it on what you said.</v>

4327
01:44:19.650 --> 01:44:20.700
<v Speaker 3>It's your fault.</v>

4328
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.200
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4329
01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.550
<v Speaker 3>we both agreed zero defense,</v>

4330
01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:24.413
<v Speaker 3>no fault.</v>

4331
01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.321
<v Speaker 3>From what I said,</v>

4332
01:44:25.321 --> 01:44:26.280
<v Speaker 3>it sounds horrible.</v>

4333
01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.450
<v Speaker 3>You know me mean you're like Dave,</v>

4334
01:44:27.451 --> 01:44:27.810
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

4335
01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:28.643
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4336
01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I know your whole thing,</v>

4337
01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:29.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4338
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 3>But your style of community and I know that Shell,</v>

4339
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:33.180
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

4340
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>I love your show.</v>

4341
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I love your show.</v>

4342
01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 3>I loved the Han Dynasty Shit.</v>

4343
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I level is wacky shit you do because I really think you want to sit in the rape</v>

4344
01:44:42.361 --> 01:44:42.790
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

4345
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's important to have a guy like you out there just pushing the</v>

4346
01:44:46.231 --> 01:44:46.800
<v Speaker 3>boundaries.</v>

4347
01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I think what you said about Jackie Chan,</v>

4348
01:44:48.571 --> 01:44:49.291
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

4349
01:44:49.291 --> 01:44:51.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucking important because in,</v>

4350
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:54.000
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like identifying and</v>

4351
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:57.180
<v Speaker 3>communicating about racism,</v>

4352
01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:57.481
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4353
01:44:57.481 --> 01:44:58.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a real racist thing.</v>

4354
01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.420
<v Speaker 3>And for a person who's Asian,</v>

4355
01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.040
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta be kind of fucked up.</v>

4356
01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:02.730
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

4357
01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:03.600
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of fucked up.</v>

4358
01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:04.434
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I just,</v>

4359
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Sheen out there,</v>

4360
01:45:05.670 --> 01:45:07.260
<v Speaker 3>it's banging hookers and it's like,</v>

4361
01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Yay,</v>

4362
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:08.623
<v Speaker 3>Code Charlie.</v>

4363
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:09.840
<v Speaker 3>But then you do it.</v>

4364
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4365
01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:10.471
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4366
01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Dave's creepy.</v>

4367
01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:11.681
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

4368
01:45:11.681 --> 01:45:12.290
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

4369
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:15.840
<v Speaker 3>the people that like come at me the most Asian women,</v>

4370
01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.130
<v Speaker 3>they're mad at you.</v>

4371
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:18.010
<v Speaker 3>They're mad at me and says,</v>

4372

01:45:18.901 --> 01:45:19.734
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

4374
01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.530
<v Speaker 3>but you're all Asian all the time.</v>

4375
01:45:22.531 --> 01:45:23.890
<v Speaker 3>But this is what it's done on the grave.</v>

4376
01:45:23.891 --> 01:45:24.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4377
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:24.551

<v Speaker 2>It's like literally like I was sitting at home one day and like there was a</v>

4508
01:48:39.961 --> 01:48:41.550
<v Speaker 2>glitch on our website and they're like,</v>

4515
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.860

4516
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:50.694
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

4517
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do this.</v>

4518
01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have to do this.</v>

4519
01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.370

4520
01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:57.750

4549
01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't watch a lot of television,</v>

4550

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4585
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta assume that then people are looking at you as a target.</v>

4586
01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:51.580
<v Speaker 2>They're going after you.</v>

4587

<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4634
01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:53.460
<v Speaker 1>this persona that you've created,</v>

4635
01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:54.360
<v Speaker 1>you who you are,</v>

4636
01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4637
01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:57.240
<v Speaker 1>your actual human existence where you are.</v>

4638
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

4639
01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.480
<v Speaker 1>all the hyperbole and exaggeration and fun and chaos and all the stuff that</v>

4640
01:52:03.481 --> 01:52:03.961
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

4641
01:52:03.961 --> 01:52:07.470
<v Speaker 1>all the machine guns in buttholes and all this chaos,</v>

4642
01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you're automatically going to attract a certain amount of unsavory attention and</v>

4643
01:52:12.961 --> 01:52:13.351
<v Speaker 1>learned that,</v>

4644
01:52:13.351 --> 01:52:13.620
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4645
01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:13.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4646
01:52:13.771 --> 01:52:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it's also plus people are fucking haters.</v>

4647
01:52:16.291 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of years out there and there's a lot of people be stronger.</v>

4648
01:52:19.590 --> 01:52:22.660
<v Speaker 1>They want to not like something they,</v>

4649
01:52:22.661 --> 01:52:26.010
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for something to distract them from the miserable existence that</v>

4650
01:52:26.011 --> 01:52:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they're caught up in or,</v>

4651
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:28.650
<v Speaker 1>and there's also people that think,</v>

4652
01:52:28.651 --> 01:52:29.100
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4653
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.150
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a piece of shit.</v>

4654
01:52:30.151 --> 01:52:30.984
<v Speaker 1>Rapist.</v>

4655
01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a target now.</v>

4656
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And then they go after you because of that.</v>

4657
01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:33.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4658
01:52:33.781 --> 01:52:34.614
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with it?</v>

4659
01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.660
<v Speaker 1>My dog done not a red piece of shit rapists.</v>

4660
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4661
01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're a very nice person to say,</v>

4662
01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:39.450
<v Speaker 1>be nice.</v>

4663
01:52:39.450 --> 01:52:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I know you have crazy fans,</v>

4664
01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:42.390
<v Speaker 1>so it's to get crazy people.</v>

4665
01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to get a certain amount of them in.</v>

4666
01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4667
01:52:44.190 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

4668
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why,</v>

4669
01:52:46.641 --> 01:52:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean I assume one of the reasons why the people that liked the show are so</v>

4670
01:52:50.301 --> 01:52:50.571
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

4671
01:52:50.571 --> 01:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>My fans are so nice.</v>

4672
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's because I'm a nice person and you can also fuck them up by just,</v>

4673
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

4674
01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.350
<v Speaker 1>People could shoot you.</v>

4675
01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:59.920
<v Speaker 1>You know the people we say [inaudible] old go kick people's asses.</v>

4676
01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't last.</v>

4677
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4678
01:53:01.730 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 1>you pick KP,</v>

4679
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.141
<v Speaker 1>people's acids,</v>

4680
01:53:03.141 --> 01:53:03.891
<v Speaker 1>they don't like that.</v>

4681
01:53:03.891 --> 01:53:04.431
<v Speaker 1>They shoot you,</v>

4682
01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:04.971
<v Speaker 1>they stab you,</v>

4683
01:53:04.971 --> 01:53:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they run you over the car.</v>

4684
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Just be nice.</v>

4685
01:53:07.190 --> 01:53:08.023
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

4686
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>martial arts is supposed to be about developing your character,</v>

4687
01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>about figuring out how you overcome difficult obstacles and how that makes you a</v>

4688
01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:17.114
<v Speaker 1>better person.</v>

4689
01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is for me.</v>

4690
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4691
01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's not about that,</v>

4692
01:53:20.721 --> 01:53:24.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's also about being confident so you don't have to worry about is many</v>

4693
01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 1>people kicking your ass.</v>

4694
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:27.140
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be some people that can kick your ass no matter who you</v>

4695
01:53:27.141 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 1>are really.</v>

4696
01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4697
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're at the top of the fucking heat and then you're only at the top of</v>

4698
01:53:30.711 --> 01:53:31.910
<v Speaker 1>the heap for a certain amount of time.</v>

4699
01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Then when Cain Velasquez beat the fuck out of Brock Lesnar,</v>

4700
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:35.211
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

4701
01:53:35.211 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4702
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.290
<v Speaker 1>You can be a guy like Brock Lesnar somewhere out there.</v>

4703
01:53:39.291 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 1>This is bad ass dude with brown pride tattooed on his chest.</v>

4704
01:53:42.801 --> 01:53:44.360
<v Speaker 1>He just beats the shit out of you.</v>

4705
01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Always be someone that's always gonna be someone most likely.</v>

4706
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 1>But I think you put out a certain energy and you get back a certain energy.</v>

4707
01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the metaphor I said in high school I fought like almost every weekend</v>

4708
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.761
<v Speaker 2>didn't win.</v>

4709
01:53:58.761 --> 01:54:00.500
<v Speaker 2>90% of them still did it.</v>

4710
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that's,</v>

4711
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.250
<v Speaker 2>if that's a says anything about you,</v>

4712
01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:06.140
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

4713
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4714
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 2>short of like putting a bullet in my head,</v>

4715
01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:10.640
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like you,</v>

4716
01:54:10.730 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you getting in that that black guy putting you in a thing and humiliating you.</v>

4717
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've been embarrassed,</v>

4718
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 2>humiliated.</v>

4719
01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I've been called a rapist.</v>

4720
01:54:17.901 --> 01:54:22.901
<v Speaker 2>I've lost love and finance and anything bad you can do to me.</v>

4721
01:54:24.141 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I've been in jail,</v>

4722
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I've almost gotten raped.</v>

4723
01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:27.201
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4724

4777
01:55:38.421 --> 01:55:39.141
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also like,</v>

4787
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:48.300

<v Speaker 2>yourself because I have not mastered that yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

5010
02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:12.660
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

5011
02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:13.570
<v Speaker 2>the way I started the show,</v>

5012
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:14.531
<v Speaker 2>oh well he's rich.</v>

5013
02:01:14.531 --> 02:01:14.801
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5014
02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:16.630
<v Speaker 2>well what about my entire life?</v>

5015
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:17.681
<v Speaker 2>Up until then,</v>

5016
02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>like was that a to marginalized people love to find some way where you're not</v>

5017
02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:23.134
<v Speaker 2>better than that.</v>

5018
02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:27.010
<v Speaker 2>The difference with the Facebook thing in my life before was nobody knew how</v>

5019
02:01:27.011 --> 02:01:27.844
<v Speaker 2>much money I had.</v>

5020
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:29.530
<v Speaker 2>So when they went to my hoarder's house,</v>

5021
02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>like I had millions already.</v>

5022
02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I already sold out a million dollar art show in London.</v>

5023
02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I had millions from gambling.</v>

5024
02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

5025
02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>but nobody knew and I was like,</v>

5026
02:01:37.811 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>so I can still like that's the best.</v>

5027
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It's the best Combo.</v>

5028
02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.830
<v Speaker 2>You get to live a normal life,</v>

5029
02:01:42.831 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but you're fucking Richard Shit.</v>

5030
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And then so you were rich before the Facebook shit.</v>

5031
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Even when I didn't have hundreds of millions,</v>

5032
02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 2>but I had a few million and I was like,</v>

5033
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:50.721
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

5034
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>that's more than I ever thought I would make.</v>

5035
02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm selling paintings for a couple of hundred grand,</v>

5036
02:01:54.501 --> 02:01:55.334
<v Speaker 2>like it was awesome.</v>

5037
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I go to Vegas and went a hundred grand.</v>

5038
02:01:56.901 --> 02:01:57.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

5039
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it was a very good life.</v>

5040
02:01:58.940 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 2>But now it's like,</v>

5041
02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5044
02:02:04.221 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Give me money,</v>

5045
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:05.500
<v Speaker 2>give me money.</v>

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get people money?</v>

5047
02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:06.801
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5048
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:07.634
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

5049
02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I hide it.</v>

5050
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

5051
02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:09.463

5053
02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:12.524

5054
02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:13.250

<v Speaker 2>I want to make it all cryptic like the game and make it super hard.</v>

5061
02:02:24.771 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5062
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5063

<v Speaker 2>I'm literally forced feeding you the answers.</v>

5064
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:27.561

02:02:27.651 --> 02:02:29.240
<v Speaker 2>what if more than one person finds it?</v>

5067
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:30.410
<v Speaker 2>We have a whole thing.</v>

5068
02:02:30.411 --> 02:02:31.244
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5069
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:32.151
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

5070
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:33.470
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks I'm hiding cash.</v>

5071
02:02:33.471 --> 02:02:33.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5072
02:02:33.741 --> 02:02:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I already learned from the Detroit thing.</v>

5073
02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hiding cash.</v>

5074
02:02:35.811 --> 02:02:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to give it to you.</v>

5075
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:37.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm hiding clues,</v>

5076
02:02:37.611 --> 02:02:39.020
<v Speaker 2>which is a red dot.</v>

5077
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>That critter spray painted at nearby the,</v>

5078
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>the place you go there,</v>

5079
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>you take a selfie of yourself in front of the clue with uh,</v>

5080
02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5081
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 2>a current newspaper.</v>

5082
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And then the first 10 people,</v>

5083
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.950
<v Speaker 2>they get the points and at the end,</v>

5084
02:02:51.951 --> 02:02:53.150
<v Speaker 2>whoever has the most points.</v>

5085
02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:53.991
<v Speaker 2>And right now,</v>

5086
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:54.441
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

5087
02:02:54.441 --> 02:02:57.290
<v Speaker 2>there's only like 10 people playing and it's like the points are scattered.</v>

5088
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:58.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's like anyone's game.</v>

5089
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:00.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to announce the winner on Halloween.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then on November 2nd,</v>

5091
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.313

<v Speaker 2>November 2nd,</v>

5094
02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:06.824
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>

5095
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

5096
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

5097

<v Speaker 2>you ever do an Ama on reddit?</v>

5098
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5099
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:13.550
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't even know what reddit was.</v>

5100
02:03:13.551 --> 02:03:14.001
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like,</v>

5101
02:03:14.001 --> 02:03:15.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the front page of the Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so what does that mean?</v>

5105
02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you up vote.</v>

5107
02:03:18.351 --> 02:03:18.531
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that's why you live in a tiny little place.</v>

5242
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 2>He didn't move to some suburban neighborhood in Beverly Hills and set up shop</v>

02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:19.460
<v Speaker 2>You live like a crazy person.</v>

5247
02:06:19.461 --> 02:06:21.120
<v Speaker 2>It's manufactured misery,</v>

5248
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:21.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:22.890
<v Speaker 2>the whole lot miserable.</v>

02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 2>You're not miserable.</v>

5251
02:06:23.670 --> 02:06:24.480
<v Speaker 2>It's miserable.</v>

5252
02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:25.230
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

5253
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:25.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5254
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 2>it's smells so bad in there.</v>

5255
02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:28.120
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

5256
02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.730
<v Speaker 2>there's cockroaches,</v>

5257
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:30.600
<v Speaker 2>ants.</v>

5258
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:31.141
<v Speaker 2>But why,</v>

5259
02:06:31.141 --> 02:06:31.980
<v Speaker 2>why do that then?</v>

5260
02:06:32.370 --> 02:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

5261
02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:35.051
<v Speaker 2>you and me,</v>

5262
02:06:35.051 --> 02:06:35.884
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about like,</v>

5263
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:36.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5264
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you should eat kale and this and that.</v>

5265
02:06:37.981 --> 02:06:38.370
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

5266
02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I know at the end of the day what I'm really going to do.</v>

5267
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:41.820
<v Speaker 2>And so if I sit here and go,</v>

5268
02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:42.301
<v Speaker 2>hey Dave,</v>

5269
02:06:42.301 --> 02:06:43.890
<v Speaker 2>forget all this fucking bullshit.</v>

5270
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:44.730
<v Speaker 2>You've talked up until now,</v>

5271
02:06:44.731 --> 02:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>your podcasts,</v>

5272
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:46.590
<v Speaker 2>TV bullshit.</v>

5273
02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:47.423
<v Speaker 2>You're an artist.</v>

5274
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5275
02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:50.430
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk real talk about you being an artist.</v>

5276
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:54.120
<v Speaker 2>How much have you actually painted in the last 10 years?</v>

5277
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:55.253
<v Speaker 2>Not that much.</v>

5278
02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:56.161
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5279
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at your entire life.</v>

5280
02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.400
<v Speaker 2>When have you painted the most?</v>

5281
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:01.380
<v Speaker 2>When I was in jail in Japan,</v>

5282
02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>when I was in a cold,</v>

5283
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:05.370
<v Speaker 2>miserable place in China with no Internet,</v>

5284
02:07:05.371 --> 02:07:06.270
<v Speaker 2>no cell service.</v>

5285
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:07.710
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

5286
02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:08.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5287
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:11.820
<v Speaker 2>the combining factors of all these places is that it was always cold,</v>

5288
02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>no internet and no cell service and no one else around.</v>

5289
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.920
<v Speaker 2>So isolation,</v>

5290
02:07:16.921 --> 02:07:21.921
<v Speaker 2>cold and miserable and just that's what it takes now because I,</v>

5291
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I am easily distracted,</v>

5292
02:07:23.881 --> 02:07:25.170
<v Speaker 2>addictive person so I can't,</v>

5293
02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:28.530
<v Speaker 2>and I do have a lot of options for pussy that I never had before.</v>

5294
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I do have all these things and it's why do Joe's cross crosshatching of a</v>

5295
02:07:34.741 --> 02:07:35.574
<v Speaker 2>werewolf would like,</v>

5312
02:08:05.610 --> 02:08:06.443
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it?</v>

5313
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5316
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.863

5317
02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:19.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a self destruct thing that distracts you.</v>

5318
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.671
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5319
02:08:20.671 --> 02:08:20.931

02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:25.170
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing is creating and pussy.</v>

5323
02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:26.333
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

02:08:27.150 --> 02:08:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and let me just ask you this Joe,</v>

5326
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>cause cause you're in it,</v>

5327
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you're a comedian like,</v>

5328
02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:37.490
<v Speaker 2>like the whole white Wa like is the great art always come from misery.</v>

5329
02:08:37.491 --> 02:08:38.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jim Carrey,</v>

5330
02:08:38.991 --> 02:08:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Murray like do you have to be miserable?</v>

5331
02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

5332
02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I believe you can make really good art if you're well adjusted and you're happy</v>

5333
02:08:48.981 --> 02:08:49.814
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

5334
02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:53.900
<v Speaker 2>But I'm talking about the great shit that transcends time and whatever those</v>

5335
02:08:53.901 --> 02:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>people are suicidal,</v>

5336
02:08:54.981 --> 02:08:55.940
<v Speaker 2>miserable fucks.</v>

5337
02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And then speaking just for me,</v>

5338
02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:01.970
<v Speaker 2>because I know my best stuff always came from rejection,</v>

5339
02:09:01.971 --> 02:09:02.804
<v Speaker 2>hatred,</v>

5340
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:03.830
<v Speaker 2>getting dumped,</v>

5341
02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>living in miserable conditions.</v>

5342
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about living</v>

5343
02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:12.940
<v Speaker 1>in a 20 story like our 20 bedroom fucking mansion in Beverly Hills with pools in</v>

5344
02:09:13.641 --> 02:09:14.780
<v Speaker 1>playboy models hanging around.</v>

5345
02:09:14.930 --> 02:09:15.950
<v Speaker 1>That makes me want to create,</v>

5346
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that makes me want to find getting your ball sack by playboy playmates.</v>

5347
02:09:20.210 --> 02:09:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It's still the most amazing paradise ever.</v>

5348
02:09:22.971 --> 02:09:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not staying in suites and Vegas and bang a $10,000 hookers.</v>

5349
02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You talking girls in the fucking you that never was sex workers,</v>

5350
02:09:30.111 --> 02:09:30.381
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

5351
02:09:30.381 --> 02:09:31.214
<v Speaker 1>sex worker side.</v>

5352
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say horror at least.</v>

5353
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:33.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5354
02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5355
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to change your opinion.</v>

5356
02:09:37.210 --> 02:09:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5357
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:39.760
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm trying to say is you,</v>

5358
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:41.990
<v Speaker 1>you love a lot of different things,</v>

5359
02:09:41.991 --> 02:09:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but you definitely have a self destructive streak.</v>

5360
02:09:44.451 --> 02:09:45.284
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

5361
02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.040
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and I was doing standup when I first started doing standup,</v>

5362
02:09:49.041 --> 02:09:49.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I thought is,</v>

5363
02:09:49.971 --> 02:09:50.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5364
02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to get enlightened,</v>

5365
02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:51.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5366
02:09:51.921 --> 02:09:52.731
<v Speaker 1>Because if I get enlightened,</v>

5367
02:09:52.731 --> 02:09:53.840
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fuck up my comedy.</v>

5368
02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:54.051
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5369
02:09:54.051 --> 02:09:57.260
<v Speaker 1>where's my comedy was always my favorite comedy was always like Sam Kennison and</v>

5370
02:09:57.261 --> 02:09:58.094
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor.</v>

5371
02:09:58.130 --> 02:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Troubled people are dirty people.</v>

5372
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And I was always thinking like,</v>

5373
02:10:01.701 --> 02:10:02.031
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5374
02:10:02.031 --> 02:10:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you can never like achieve a certain amount of enlightenment because then you'll</v>

5375
02:10:05.151 --> 02:10:07.430
<v Speaker 1>never be able to do like the great comedy.</v>

5376
02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:08.210
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

5377
02:10:08.210 --> 02:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a trap.</v>

5378
02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:09.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5379
02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:10.131
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

02:10:11.250 --> 02:10:12.210

5383
02:10:12.211 --> 02:10:13.200

5386
02:10:15.721 --> 02:10:17.910
<v Speaker 2>and I remember thinking like,</v>

5387
02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:18.953

5393
02:10:26.311 --> 02:10:29.700
<v Speaker 2>waiting for me to go in there in a beautiful house in Beverly Hills.</v>

5394
02:10:30.150 --> 02:10:30.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5395
02:10:30.241 --> 02:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call it quits for tonight.</v>

5396
02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:33.920

5407
02:10:45.081 --> 02:10:46.670

<v Speaker 2>Like to know that that's there.</v>

5445
02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go and then learn something and become enlightened and then find</v>

5446
02:11:35.871 --> 02:11:37.910
<v Speaker 2>out that I actually hate myself in hate porn.</v>

5501
02:12:53.151 --> 02:12:57.170
<v Speaker 2>she needs it and she knows if she sucks it really good that there's 2000 bucks</v>

<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

5506
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And you've heard this before,</v>

5507
02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:08.420

<v Speaker 2>So I get my dick sucked amazingly.</v>

5511
02:13:16.731 --> 02:13:19.430
<v Speaker 2>or like a lifeline UV into her system.</v>

5512
02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Then she leaves and I spend all night writing,</v>

5513
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:23.540
<v Speaker 2>drawing,</v>

5514

02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:36.414
<v Speaker 2>sexual needs.</v>

5523
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:37.590

5524
02:13:37.591 --> 02:13:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I cap it off with another bull job from a different drug.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be,</v>

5636

<v Speaker 2>I'd rather like,</v>

5640
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:04.590
<v Speaker 2>and Jackie Chan doesn't count.</v>

5641
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be like number 10 or 20 down the list,</v>

5642
02:16:07.891 --> 02:16:08.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5643
02:16:08.161 --> 02:16:09.690
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to be the guy in the forefront,</v>

5644
02:16:09.691 --> 02:16:10.524
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

5645
02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not complaining at all.</v>

5646
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:12.541
<v Speaker 2>I am complaining,</v>

5647
02:16:12.541 --> 02:16:13.231
<v Speaker 2>but I'm here.</v>

5648
02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do my job and,</v>

5649
02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to do it as best I can.</v>

5650
02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:16.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5651
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like I had to armchair psychoanalyze you.</v>

5652
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:26.390
<v Speaker 2>I would say that you spend a lot of time conflicting with other people's</v>

5653
02:16:27.001 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 2>expectations and everything is very conflicted.</v>

5654
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

5655
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.461
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

5656
02:16:30.461 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you seem so free when you do your own thing.</v>

5657
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:34.270
<v Speaker 1>But now this is the question,</v>

5658
02:16:34.290 --> 02:16:34.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5659
02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Is part of what makes you enjoy your life.</v>

5660
02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:42.541
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you reject these other people's expectations and their,</v>

5661
02:16:42.721 --> 02:16:46.540
<v Speaker 1>their definitions of you and you get to live free on your own end.</v>

5662
02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You're proving that you're successful,</v>

5663
02:16:48.341 --> 02:16:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you're creating great art,</v>

5664
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you're having fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're David motherfucking show on top of the fact that all these people want</v>

5668
02:16:59.171 --> 02:16:59.650

<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile you're creating all this great art and you're living in chaos and</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're going to laugh.</v>

5686
02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So recently I was having sex with this girl that has a lot of lines on her</v>

5687
02:17:24.671 --> 02:17:25.210

02:17:32.051 --> 02:17:32.351

<v Speaker 2>So she said No.</v>

5701
02:17:35.201 --> 02:17:35.501

<v Speaker 2>your mouth is very blunt and you get in a lot,</v>

5724
02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:04.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of trouble.</v>

5725
02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:06.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I didn't grow up around Koreans.</v>

5726
02:18:06.310 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I grew up around Jews.</v>

5727
02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:09.280
<v Speaker 2>So that whole like Larry David humor,</v>

5728
02:18:09.281 --> 02:18:11.170
<v Speaker 2>like the whole woody Allen Shit.</v>

5729
02:18:11.171 --> 02:18:12.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what I grew up around.</v>

5730
02:18:12.221 --> 02:18:13.031
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

5731
02:18:13.031 --> 02:18:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I can shit sit here and like fucking complain about everything,</v>

5732
02:18:15.641 --> 02:18:16.780
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

5733
02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:18.093
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

5734
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

5735
02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:19.930
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't fucking bother me.</v>

5736
02:18:19.931 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I am very free.</v>

5737
02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I can just in one second say fuck this podcast and just quit it.</v>

5738
02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5739
02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:25.180
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

5740
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying is I think part of what makes you happy is this battle.</v>

5741
02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:30.551
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

5742
02:18:30.551 --> 02:18:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that's just being Korean.</v>

5743
02:18:31.691 --> 02:18:33.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing I could do about that.</v>

5744
02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Korean makes you want to a fighting chance things.</v>

5745
02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

5746
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:38.080
<v Speaker 2>talked to Bordain about this on the show.</v>

5747
02:18:38.081 --> 02:18:40.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like they probably have it in every culture,</v>

5748
02:18:40.691 --> 02:18:41.620
<v Speaker 2>their own version of it.</v>

5749
02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:43.810
<v Speaker 2>But in Korea it's called Han and it's like,</v>

5750
02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:44.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like genetic.</v>

5751
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're just like,</v>

5752
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who has adopted a Korean son and he has his own kid and he goes,</v>

5757

5758
02:18:58.990 --> 02:19:01.360

5772
02:19:22.810 --> 02:19:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean he makes me look like it's just piss and vinegar,</v>

5773
02:19:26.261 --> 02:19:27.260

5776
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:29.120
<v Speaker 3>are you so angry?</v>

5777
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.561
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:29.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5779

02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.940
<v Speaker 3>come on dude.</v>

5782
02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the keep GNR bloat or whatever.</v>

5783
02:19:34.791 --> 02:19:39.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's Korea is a small island or thought Ireland's a small country that's</v>

5784
02:19:39.651 --> 02:19:44.651
<v Speaker 3>been invaded by Japanese and fucking Chinese and everyone's always trying to</v>

5785
02:19:44.991 --> 02:19:45.741
<v Speaker 3>take over Korea.</v>

5786
02:19:45.741 --> 02:19:48.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's like almost like a evolution,</v>

5787
02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:52.430
<v Speaker 3>like builtin hate system of just being born like right,</v>

5788
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5789
02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Took one day.</v>

5790
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:55.101

02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:56.623
<v Speaker 3>hard work.</v>

5793
02:19:56.690 --> 02:19:57.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5794
02:19:57.711 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that there's a lot of similarities between Jews and Koreans.</v>

5795
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I think on that end know I grew up with a lot of Koreans.</v>

5796
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.571
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5797
02:20:04.571 --> 02:20:05.980
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I'm talking about environment,</v>

5798
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm talking about right now.</v>

5799
02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was,</v>

5800
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I was around Koreans constantly.</v>

5801
02:20:10.981 --> 02:20:11.690
<v Speaker 3>They're loud.</v>

5802
02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

5803
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:17.110
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about him is I've never met more people like as a group that are</v>

5804
02:20:17.331 --> 02:20:21.290
<v Speaker 3>more dedicated to hard work and like if you don't work hard,</v>

5805
02:20:21.291 --> 02:20:23.750
<v Speaker 3>if you're not miserable from working hard all the time.</v>

5806
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5807
02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:25.250
<v Speaker 3>He felt like a piece of shit.</v>

5808
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5809
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a friend,</v>

02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:28.821
<v Speaker 3>junk.</v>

5814
02:20:28.821 --> 02:20:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Sick Chang.</v>

5815
02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5816
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:30.351
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

5817
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:34.580
<v Speaker 3>he was a national taekwondo champion and at the same time he was going through</v>

5818
02:20:34.581 --> 02:20:35.750
<v Speaker 3>his fucking residency,</v>

5819
02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:37.140
<v Speaker 3>medical residency.</v>

5820
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:38.780
<v Speaker 3>So this guy was always tired.</v>

5821
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.730
<v Speaker 3>This is how I would see him like this.</v>

5822
02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:41.751
<v Speaker 3>Always tired.</v>

5823
02:20:41.751 --> 02:20:44.440
<v Speaker 3>And then he was just fucking workout really all for it and then be exhausted.</v>

5824
02:20:44.610 --> 02:20:49.490
<v Speaker 3>He would be at school and he was training so he would like be studying all day</v>

5825
02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:51.020
<v Speaker 3>and then he would run upstairs.</v>

5826
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:52.880
<v Speaker 3>You run up the flight of stairs at the university.</v>

5827
02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:54.830
<v Speaker 3>He was constantly tired,</v>

5828
02:20:54.831 --> 02:20:56.000
<v Speaker 3>constantly miserable.</v>

5829
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:59.230
<v Speaker 3>But he felt like if he didn't live like that right.</v>

5830
02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:00.260
<v Speaker 3>And I have to be happy,</v>

5831
02:21:00.261 --> 02:21:01.040
<v Speaker 3>that's in me,</v>

5832
02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:01.821
<v Speaker 3>that's in my blood.</v>

5833
02:21:01.821 --> 02:21:01.981
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5834
02:21:01.981 --> 02:21:05.840
<v Speaker 3>and so let me take it straight down to comedy and let me get racist for a</v>

5835
02:21:05.841 --> 02:21:06.674
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

5836
02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:07.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5837
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:08.721
<v Speaker 3>people ask,</v>

5838

<v Speaker 3>Koreans?</v>

5849
02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:18.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5850
02:21:18.111 --> 02:21:19.070

<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

6204
02:28:53.901 --> 02:28:54.740
<v Speaker 1>But if I had a guest,</v>

6209
02:29:01.521 --> 02:29:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like there was a girl that like,</v>

6211
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:09.320
<v Speaker 1>And Bobby talked to the girl and the guy stood up and Bobby was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck these bitches.</v>
