<v Speaker 3>And also recognize him for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't try to make him look up</v>

305
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.700
<v Speaker 3>anything other than what he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flawed,</v>

306
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.880
<v Speaker 3>brilliant but flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy all over the place.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like after 20 years or 30 years and at </v>

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what did he do wrong?</v>

321
00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why was he some of his shit so good.</v>

322
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Some of the shit that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear and loathing in Las Vegas is still </v>

323
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.900
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite books just to just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mad crazy book.</v>

324
00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:46.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dude and his friend just dropping </v>

325
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.811
<v Speaker 3>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just fucking people over on the </v>

326
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:49.811
<v Speaker 3>hotel bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

327
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:49.910
<v Speaker 3>it's a great fucking book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

328
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.460
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's alive,</v>

329
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.020
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

330
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 5>he's like his writing there some shit in</v>
<v Speaker 5>there that was alive and it's not </v>

331
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.851
<v Speaker 5>everybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is or why a person </v>

332
00:15:00.851 --> 00:15:03.671
<v Speaker 5>can or can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what drives me crazy is when they </v>

333
00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 5>can do something like that and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>still fall apart.</v>

334
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.070
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

335
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like what brings them to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dance kills them when they get there.</v>

336
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

337
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Well it's because nothing is constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

338
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 2>like if you're so passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

339
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 2>there's something that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurture in that or like.</v>

340
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 2>And we're constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is forever going to be that way.</v>

341
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 2>So in five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you don't cultivate that kind of</v>

342
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 2>life and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

343
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden five years down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>

344
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:32.530
<v Speaker 2>just not give a fuck about land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just completely like be a completely </v>

345
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>

346
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:32.970
<v Speaker 2>We need to,</v>

347
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 5>you have to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be comfortable in the </v>

348
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.741
<v Speaker 5>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And part of the struggle is constantly </v>

349
00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:44.010
<v Speaker 5>creating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly coming up with new things </v>

350
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.440
<v Speaker 5>because as soon as you stop doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you stopped creating and you stop </v>

351
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.351
<v Speaker 5>exploring it and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>utilizing that part of your mind in </v>

352
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:49.351
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

353
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:49.351
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your spirit,</v>

354
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.780
<v Speaker 5>it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only reason why it's there is</v>

355
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:57.781
<v Speaker 5>because it took you fucking 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 years ago and on stage over and over </v>

356
00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.740
<v Speaker 5>again until I cultivate this thing where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how to do it correctly,</v>

357
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:04.741
<v Speaker 5>like you get into this groove.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that can easily slip away from you </v>

358
00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 5>just don't pay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when I was on news radio,</v>

359
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:11.070
<v Speaker 5>there was like two years when I was on </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I didn't write a fucking single </v>

360
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 5>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do it.</v>

361
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.180
<v Speaker 5>All I did was performed at the laugh </v>
<v Speaker 5>factory.</v>

362
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.780
<v Speaker 5>And I performed at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

363
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any roadwork at all and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't write it all.</v>

364
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the Sitcom.</v>

365
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.160
<v Speaker 5>A Sitcom was a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

366
00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:26.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we work long hours and I'd be tired and </v>

367
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:26.161
<v Speaker 5>I would show up at the comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just had no,</v>

368
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:27.550
<v Speaker 5>no ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

369
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have any new material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all the stuff that I'd been doing</v>

370
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:35.161
<v Speaker 5>for years already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had lost all connection with what </v>

371
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:35.161
<v Speaker 5>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

372
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:39.271
<v Speaker 5>Like some bits they get to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just kind of saying a bunch of </v>

373
00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:42.691
<v Speaker 5>things that you know will work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'm not even thinking about </v>

374
00:16:42.691 --> 00:16:45.721
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in the moment while I'm saying </v>

375
00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:45.721
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

376
00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:45.721
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

377
00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:49.170
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize it until I had some </v>

378
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.601
<v Speaker 5>writers come to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some guys that were writers on news </v>

379
00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:51.601
<v Speaker 5>radio.</v>

380
00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:54.610
<v Speaker 5>It was ugly and it was a late night sat </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the comedy store and the late nights </v>

381
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.891
<v Speaker 5>at the comedy store in the main room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's only like fucking 15 people </v>

382
00:16:58.891 --> 00:16:58.891
<v Speaker 5>that places a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

383
00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:01.570
<v Speaker 5>it's a cavern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I went up there and just just really</v>

384
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:04.840
<v Speaker 5>had a shitty set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just felt uncomfortable and that made</v>

385
00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 5>me really realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

386
00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.600
<v Speaker 5>you don't even work on your comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

387
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:08.680
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

388
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.530
<v Speaker 5>It's going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the thing that was the most fun for</v>

389
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:16.531
<v Speaker 5>you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're not doing it anymore and now </v>

390
00:17:16.531 --> 00:17:16.531
<v Speaker 5>when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like weird about it.</v>

391
00:17:16.531 --> 00:17:19.030
<v Speaker 5>So maybe like sort of reorganize and </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure it out.</v>

392
00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 5>But I think for a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they just start doing the,</v>

393
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.990
<v Speaker 5>they become successful or they somehow </v>
<v Speaker 5>or another,</v>

394
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get enough success so that they can make</v>

395
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:31.000
<v Speaker 5>a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they just kinda like stop,</v>

396
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

397
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>that's when you kind of die on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so sad.</v>

398
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>And yet I feel myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I constantly have to keep.</v>

399
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:45.001
<v Speaker 2>can like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so new to this comedy game and </v>

401
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:45.001
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

402
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I find myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I was just in my little tiny </v>

403
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 2>apartment in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean now it's still a tiny apartment,</v>

404
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

405
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>but you just change your surroundings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the change the people around you.</v>

406
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.270
<v Speaker 3>And now all of a sudden it's a business </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have an agent and a manager and </v>

407
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 3>they have plans to career planning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's that little spark that I had </v>

410
00:18:06.111 --> 00:18:08.031
<v Speaker 3>inside me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was pushing me to do this in the </v>

411
00:18:08.031 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 3>first place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you lose that,</v>

412
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 3>like you just like completely lost and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden so easy to talk you into</v>

413
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:15.620
<v Speaker 3>being business minded and business </v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I've never really understood.</v>

440
00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a real commitment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana White.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

446
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is me doing my own content and I</v>

447
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:48.381
<v Speaker 3>fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the creative freedom that comes </v>

448
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:48.381
<v Speaker 3>along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's looking over your shoulder,</v>

449
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:49.890
<v Speaker 3>you're just doing whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I get,</v>

450
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I got to d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my tip.</v>

451
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like I'll never give that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

453
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also why your stuff is so good </v>

454
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 3>because he is coming from your mind gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>all like when,</v>

455
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when one person does this and it sounds </v>

456
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really believed this.</v>

457
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 3>When one person is involved in creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and then they put it out,</v>

458
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.420
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

459
00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:12.421
<v Speaker 3>you get a sense of their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you get like a glimpse into their </v>

460
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:13.490
<v Speaker 3>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

461
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck of frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tune into what a bunch of people </v>

462

531
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 3>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

532
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:56.800
<v Speaker 3>They've been talking so much shit on 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and t they don't understand the power of</v>

533
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 3>the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that motherfucker comes,</v>

534
00:22:58.091 --> 00:23:00.220
<v Speaker 3>a wave of freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to come over to your side.</v>

535
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.400
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like 15 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from 18 t they're estimating are </v>

536
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Speaker 3>gonna vacate their contracts early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a large number of men,</v>

537
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.110
<v Speaker 3>even more like business people.</v>

538
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.630
<v Speaker 2>You know what I was doing an AP and t </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial last night I was sitting </v>

539
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.391
<v Speaker 2>there and I was sending all these photos</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my flicker and I was also trying to </v>

540
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:22.460
<v Speaker 2>download this youtube video and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody calls me if somebody would have</v>

541
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:24.320
<v Speaker 2>called me during that on the verizon </v>
<v Speaker 2>network,</v>

542
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.490
<v Speaker 2>all that shit would have failed your </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

543
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.480
<v Speaker 2>And so I was thinking that's pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

544
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a heavy user of Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.360
<v Speaker 2>But I mean even if you're on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're loading of video and then </v>

546
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:39.950
<v Speaker 2>somebody calls you halfway through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

547
00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.480
<v Speaker 2>That video is not loading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

548
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good plug.</v>

549
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.010
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

550
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point if you look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

551
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

552
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't understand why verizon </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do that.</v>

553
00:23:48.491 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand though,</v>

554
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 3>when they get to four G,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that won't be an issue anymore.</v>

555
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

556
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four.</v>

557
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 3>So for ge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's cdma as opposed to just</v>

558
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 3>the network's good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually just older,</v>

559
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 3>like an older older technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called CDMA and if for some reason,</v>

560
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 3>even though it's older technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it penetrates deeper into buildings.</v>

561
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's one of the that goes so </v>

562
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 3>it gives you more cancer kids.</v>

694
00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:36.801
<v Speaker 3>in Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The show that I was on had one point 2 </v>

695
00:29:36.801 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 3>million people watching it every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on the league,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's what we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's broadcast all</v>

697
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.070
<v Speaker 2>over the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're very supportive of their </v>

698
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.491
<v Speaker 2>culture and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they consume a quebecois culture and </v>

699
00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:51.860
<v Speaker 2>they have like huge comedy star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little,</v>

700
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:57.090
<v Speaker 2>that's why they kinda like why their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>country is like a little country on its </v>

701
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.090
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the French side.</v>

702
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.590
<v Speaker 2>English side is just is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like English Canada anywhere else.</v>

703
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Quebec is a very strange area in and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself that they want to separate from </v>

704
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 3>the rest of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a constant issue.</v>

705
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

706
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.790

707
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I mean it's goes way back but it's </v>

708
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.560
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.660
<v Speaker 2>new France became kinda like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the English beat,</v>

710
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>the French and then like you had all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this huge French population and now was </v>

711
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.870
<v Speaker 2>English territory and they were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like lax enough to go,</v>

712
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:32.871
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can keep practicing your Catholicism </v>

713
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:32.871
<v Speaker 2>and your things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

715
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:34.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the British empire know.</v>

716
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.920
<v Speaker 2>But they kind of flourished as a culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they stayed pretty close together.</v>

717
00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:45.501
<v Speaker 2>And like now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quebec is predominantly French speaking </v>

718
00:30:45.501 --> 00:30:48.561
<v Speaker 2>and it's a culture that's just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept going throughout the years and now </v>

719
00:30:48.561 --> 00:30:52.341
<v Speaker 2>they want to protect the culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many of the laws in Canada </v>

720
00:30:52.341 --> 00:30:55.791
<v Speaker 2>that do protect the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Kinda like signs have to be more </v>

721
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 2>French than with a larger in French than</v>
<v Speaker 2>in English.</v>

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of things like that that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very controversial,</v>

726
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.640
<v Speaker 3>It has to be in French at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can go to Chinatown,</v>

727
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.420

732
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.950

<v Speaker 5>the reason why Boston people are so </v>

834

<v Speaker 5>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go up to Montreal,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like a European city.</v>

842
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It's more sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the culture is totally </v>

843
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women are so much nicer,</v>

846
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.380
<v Speaker 3>weird thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know you guys like Boston,</v>

853
00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 3>like everyone from 18 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's always up in Montreal.</v>

854
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Just partying because like you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>still have.</v>

855
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 3>I still don't understand 21 to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

856
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 3>It's good because it makes it harder for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to get into bars.</v>

857
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be in bars and it's good </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't know how to not drink</v>

858
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.110
<v Speaker 3>and drive yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the scariest shit.</v>

859
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:24.111
<v Speaker 3>Just got the license.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The as shit to me is kids that don't </v>

860
00:36:24.111 --> 00:36:24.111
<v Speaker 3>know how to drive and they're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've seen stupid shit man.</v>

862
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people rear end people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen many things.</v>

863
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good thing.</v>

864
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I think they shouldn't be able to drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their 21.</v>

865
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have been able to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is you have to work so </v>

866
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.981
<v Speaker 3>you gotta let them drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen or 17 or whatever the fuck it </v>

<v Speaker 3>16 years old.</v>

881
00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:13.941
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone could have fucked up.</v>

882
00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Someone could have ran off a curb so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

883
00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:19.731
<v Speaker 3>he could have had to make a split second</v>
<v Speaker 3>move and it would have been around what </v>

884
00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:19.731
<v Speaker 3>you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

<v Speaker 3>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunk of metal around thousands of </v>

<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Even though my message board about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were like 21,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with the world when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>20 and a lot of people are going back in</v>

898

<v Speaker 3>the fucking Middle Ages,</v>

900
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.140

<v Speaker 3>opinion because I'm 20 years old.</v>

901
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with you.</v>

903
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:11.700
<v Speaker 3>You're not the same 20 year old and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to undervalue Europe.</v>

904
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Your opinion or your observations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be very intelligent.</v>

905
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 3>You might have some observations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very valid.</v>

906
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Is Not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just say the fact that you're even </v>

907
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>confident enough to want people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to your opinion at 20 shows me,</v>

908
00:38:24.841 --> 00:38:27.390

<v Speaker 3>cocky.</v>

909
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 3>You should be like just asking questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking around.</v>

910
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Just jumping in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

911
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 3>and trying to force your opinions on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 20,</v>

912
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 3>you don't really know</v>

913
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have some information,</v>

914

916
00:38:42.961 --> 00:38:46.111
<v Speaker 2>there's no 20 year old that is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to stand on television with a </v>

917
00:38:46.111 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>microphone and tell the world what needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fixed.</v>

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.540
<v Speaker 2>when I was 20 I was fucking dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was smart and I was </v>

924
00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:00.540
<v Speaker 2>right about a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

925
00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I had a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good point of view,</v>

926
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>but it was still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just fucking spastic.</v>

927
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>You're just like that 15 year old kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving that truck.</v>

928
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

929
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:09.260
<v Speaker 2>You're slamming into walls and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to use the brakes.</v>

930
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I have once in a while I have to check </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with early twenties John.</v>

931
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's morally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

932
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 2>oh this I'm reading like I still am very</v>
<v Speaker 2>curious.</v>

933
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I love reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at early twenties like I thought </v>

934
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.470
<v Speaker 2>like I figured it out like my moral code</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was so like,</v>

935
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.120
<v Speaker 2>what was the code?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

936
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I was very much a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan for.</v>

937
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

938
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

939
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but that took me a little while to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

940
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

941
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:40.981
<v Speaker 2>because I was reading a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm trying to figure out what is a </v>

942
00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:42.530
<v Speaker 2>right decision was wrong and figuring it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

943
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was now like a totally </v>

944
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.550
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different person.</v>

945
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:52.291
<v Speaker 2>But in my early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything was an important moral </v>

946
00:39:52.291 --> 00:39:52.291
<v Speaker 2>decision and I have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

947
00:39:52.291 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 2>my parents are like really pentecostal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really religious,</v>

948
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:57.020
<v Speaker 2>very like good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

949
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.060
<v Speaker 2>very religious people.</v>

950
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.300
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of have that baggage where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm trying to,</v>

951
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing good is like what makes my parents</v>

952
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 2>proud and as opposed to like oh I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these fans and stuff.</v>

953
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Like if I do something like really nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

954
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 2>that's when my parents are really proud </v>
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

955
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of have this thing,</v>

956
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 2>so I was trying to figure like him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now you know,</v>

957
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:21.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm 30 and living in La and you </v>

958
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.141
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've have a bit of success and so </v>

959
00:40:25.141 --> 00:40:25.200
<v Speaker 2>once in a while I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

960
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.450
<v Speaker 2>early twenties John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I being an asshole right now and am I</v>

961
00:40:28.451 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 2>being a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

962
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:32.450
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the time he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you asshole.</v>

963
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what's early twenties John?</v>

964
00:40:34.971 --> 00:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>A radical though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he?</v>

965
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

966
00:40:37.371 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

967
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:43.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still very close to who I was but I </v>

968
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>was much more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess rigid about things.</v>

969
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:45.390
<v Speaker 2>So like there's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

970
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.950
<v Speaker 2>like I went to a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the super,</v>

971
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I still don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when I'm shopping,</v>

972
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:56.671
<v Speaker 2>like I tried it give my money were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because buying is voting but back </v>

973
00:40:56.671 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

974
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>it's that early when you're figuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out,</v>

975
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read this book.</v>

976
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>And Naomi Klein's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 2>whenever the fuck it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

978
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:06.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

979
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

980
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 2>you try to like be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

981
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 2>it's everything's kind of black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

982
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.070
<v Speaker 2>When you realize you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

983
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just all gray and you try to figure</v>

984
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:20.431
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to be a good person as much as </v>

985
00:41:20.431 --> 00:41:21.010
<v Speaker 2>you can and try to approach things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and all that kind of stuff.</v>

986
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.830
<v Speaker 2>It's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the eating of animals thing,</v>

987
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:28.831
<v Speaker 2>is it really a very controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject and I know a lot of people that </v>

988
00:41:28.831 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of different opinions on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all very,</v>

989
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>very like adamant about how they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people who eat meat</v>

990
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.040
<v Speaker 5>just really want to justify it and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>get super aggressive about it and you </v>

991
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that don't,</v>

992
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:44.261
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've had some annoying </v>

993
00:41:44.261 --> 00:41:45.761
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers on my message board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to talk to me about eating </v>

994

<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like don't do it.</v>

995
00:41:45.761 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 5>Just try it and then go on and on and </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

<v Speaker 5>me not want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you not get that?</v>

999
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.240
<v Speaker 5>When people like say an annoying shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that and like make a mistake,</v>

1000
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think of Karma kicking you in the Dick.</v>

1001

<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get Away,</v>

1002
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 5>get away with your nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those beans are alive.</v>

1003
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:08.750
<v Speaker 5>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1004
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:13.751
<v Speaker 5>Those beans are eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're screaming as you bite down on </v>

1005
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:13.751
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you boil them,</v>

1006
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:17.471
<v Speaker 5>they're dying in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're rotting and boiling water that </v>

1007
00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 5>led us screams and agony as you rip it </v>
<v Speaker 5>from its fucking mother.</v>

1008
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

1009
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 5>That's life too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1010
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:27.971
<v Speaker 5>why is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is animal life more important than </v>

1011
00:42:27.971 --> 00:42:27.971
<v Speaker 5>plant life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we're semi related,</v>

1012
00:42:27.971 --> 00:42:28.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

1013
00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking stupid because you step </v>
<v Speaker 5>on bugs all the time.</v>

1014
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.920
<v Speaker 5>We're convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shitheads.</v>

1015
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.110
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the funny,</v>

1016
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.180
<v Speaker 5>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1017
00:42:34.181 --> 00:42:39.181
<v Speaker 5>the funniest thing is that eating meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and animal proteins helped us develop </v>

1018
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:44.130
<v Speaker 5>like our and come to the point in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness that where we are because </v>

1019
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 5>it helped develop the brain rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the fall.</v>

1020
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a controversial theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 5>Because it doesn't work that way with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other predators.</v>

1022
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean Jaguars when have big brands and </v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1023
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.480
<v Speaker 5>but that was a theory that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe was formulated before they </v>

1024
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.650
<v Speaker 5>realize how many monkeys chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat.</v>

1025
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't realize how,</v>

1026
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 5>how fucking ruthless and violent chimps </v>
<v Speaker 5>really were until they started doing </v>

1027
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 5>some studies.</v>

1028
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.730
<v Speaker 5>I forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1029
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.450
<v Speaker 5>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy's name who ran the show.</v>

1030
00:43:12.451 --> 00:43:17.451
<v Speaker 5>It was like a BBC show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was the first one to get footage </v>

1031
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 5>of chimps eating monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that was in the nineties.</v>

1032
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 5>So I think these ideas that they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that,</v>

1033
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 5>there was this too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two other theories.</v>

1034
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 5>One of them is a throwing arm and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>when people develop the ability to throw</v>

1035
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:28.160
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1036
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:33.161
<v Speaker 5>that sort of kicked off our evolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we started killing things that </v>

1037
00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 5>were far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>far away from us.</v>

1038
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Then we started getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting.</v>

1039
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 5>We thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then as we thrive,</v>

1040
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:40.790
<v Speaker 5>we got a little bit more confidence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we started thinking about things more.</v>

1041
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like that the more calm you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

1042
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:48.251
<v Speaker 5>the more control of your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you have free time to think </v>

1043
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.421
<v Speaker 5>about shit because you're not always </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting off Jaguars and all these </v>

1044
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:52.421
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

1045
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:52.850
<v Speaker 5>So we figured out how to do things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw spears,</v>

1046
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 5>throw rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1047
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 5>That's one theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another theory.</v>

1048
00:43:55.911 --> 00:44:00.911
<v Speaker 5>The other one is psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other one is psychedelic mushrooms </v>

1049
00:44:00.911 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 5>and that's the most controversial one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really the most fascinating one,</v>

1050
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 5>and it's a terence Mckenna stoned ape </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory and this theory is that somewhere</v>

1051
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 5>along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is the undisputable facts,</v>

1052
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:15.251
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the human brain size doubled over a </v>

1053
00:44:15.251 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 5>period of 2 million years and that is in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire fossil record,</v>

1054
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 5>the most confusing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like more than anything,</v>

1055
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 5>like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1056
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:25.421
<v Speaker 5>how does this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's weird for any Oregon to grow </v>

1057
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:28.720
<v Speaker 5>double the size,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the most spectacular Oregon as far </v>

1058
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 5>as creating things on the planet is in </v>
<v Speaker 5>no question the brain,</v>

1059
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 5>the human is when we alter our </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>

1060
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 5>we create nuclear bombs beyond beyond a </v>
<v Speaker 5>doubt.</v>

1061
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 5>It all happens supposedly inside this </v>
<v Speaker 5>area and this area doubled in two years.</v>

1062
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's coincidentally also the same time </v>

1063
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1064
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.680
<v Speaker 5>the rain forest receded into grasslands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a climate change and Terence </v>

1065
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.780
<v Speaker 5>Mckenna's theory is that monkeys were </v>
<v Speaker 5>forced or lower primates were forced to </v>

1066
00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.011
<v Speaker 5>come out of the trees and experiment </v>
<v Speaker 5>with new foods sources because the rain </v>

1067
00:44:58.011 --> 00:45:01.541
<v Speaker 5>forest were gone and these animals that </v>
<v Speaker 5>were in this once lush tropical </v>

1068
00:45:01.541 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 5>environment had to adapt to this new </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

1069
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:07.581
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things they did was there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a lot of cows that were eating the </v>

1070
00:45:07.581 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 5>grass and they would flip over counters </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for bugs.</v>

1071
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 5>And that's the best place for cubensis </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms to grow.</v>

1072
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 5>So these cubensis mushrooms would grow </v>
<v Speaker 5>in this cow shit.</v>

1073
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 5>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these chips and those,</v>

1074
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.540
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1075
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 5>lower primates Australia pivot gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever the fuck it was.</v>

1076
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 5>They would eat these mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is twofold.</v>

1077
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:27.651
<v Speaker 5>One that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a direct increase in their ability to </v>

1078
00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 5>see things because when you eat suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and especially in low doses,</v>

1079
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:34.881
<v Speaker 5>it increases your visual acuity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing was that it would </v>

1080
00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 5>give them this sort of community like </v>
<v Speaker 5>loving atmosphere,</v>

1081
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 5>protecting atmosphere and that will also</v>
<v Speaker 5>aid and they're less conflicts.</v>

1082
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 5>The less conflicts that they had would </v>
<v Speaker 5>aid in their innovation,</v>

1083
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like with the other thing.</v>

1084
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.640
<v Speaker 5>And also they would start having </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic experiences and in large </v>

1085
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 5>doses these psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 5>would slowly help them evolve much,</v>

1086
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 5>much quicker and sort of figure things </v>
<v Speaker 5>out that they may be not a figured out.</v>

1087
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:05.210
<v Speaker 5>And the idea of the really weird part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that they think this is all </v>

1088
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 5>Mckenna and a few other psychos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think that what mushrooms are,</v>

1089
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.570
<v Speaker 5>is some sort of an alien intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's come here from an asteroid.</v>

1090
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Because the reason for that is there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1091
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 5>like there's nothing that can survive in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vacuum better than spores.</v>

1092
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.820
<v Speaker 5>And we know that a bunch of shit is come</v>
<v Speaker 5>here on asteroids from other planets </v>

1093
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 5>like Dna or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1094
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:26.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1095
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 5>amino acids are the building blocks for </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and water.</v>

1096
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:36.531
<v Speaker 5>Water comes on comets and asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know that spores can survive in a</v>

1097
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:42.021
<v Speaker 5>vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is that somewhere on some </v>

1098
00:46:42.021 --> 00:46:44.961
<v Speaker 5>other planet there was some type of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>spore and it came here on an asteroid </v>

1099
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 5>landed and the way it communicates with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people as you eat it,</v>

1100
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.410
<v Speaker 3>this is what caused human beings to </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve at a monkey's.</v>

1101
00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:59.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is one of those five bong hit stare </v>

1102
00:46:59.411 --> 00:47:00.200
<v Speaker 3>at space and think it through for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hours.</v>

1103
00:47:00.201 --> 00:47:05.201
<v Speaker 3>At first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds totally ridiculous that </v>

1104
00:47:05.201 --> 00:47:05.201
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms are silly,</v>

1105
00:47:05.201 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's one scientist or whatever,</v>

1106
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.960
<v Speaker 3>that that thinks that there's scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

1107
00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a scholar.</v>

1108
00:47:13.251 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was.</v>

1109
00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:16.990
<v Speaker 3>The ethno botanists I think was his </v>
<v Speaker 3>chosen.</v>

1110
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.930
<v Speaker 3>If you ask any of the other thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that would know that anything</v>

1111
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.030
<v Speaker 3>close to what he's talking about when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think are very,</v>

1112
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:28.700
<v Speaker 3>very high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to realize that as a scientist,</v>

1113
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>first all getting</v>

1114
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:35.010
<v Speaker 5>behind anything that advocates a </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely new direction in evolution </v>

1115
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 5>and one based on psychedelic mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal drugs,</v>

1116
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.520
<v Speaker 5>that's a tough fucking sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So most scientists would never choose </v>

1117
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.150
<v Speaker 5>that as a point of study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a virtual cycle.</v>

1118
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:47.810
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

1119
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 5>could be that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be that too,</v>

1120
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:54.690
<v Speaker 5>but it's also they discount the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>that mushrooms could be some sort of </v>

1121
00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:00.030
<v Speaker 5>potential human evolution tool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They discount that because it sounds </v>

1122
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.811
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous that an illegal drug could </v>
<v Speaker 5>potentially aid in your evolution and </v>

1123
00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:06.010
<v Speaker 5>most of them are ignorant of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience itself.</v>

1124
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe some of them are fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>around with it had a little bit,</v>

1125
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 5>but to have a real full blown </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic experience,</v>

1126
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you you wouldn't discredit </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1127
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:17.450
<v Speaker 5>So what are these monkeys?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of like taking the cow turds,</v>

1128
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.460
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took one bite with like it says </v>

1129
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:22.750
<v Speaker 5>gross and they told their friends food </v>
<v Speaker 5>come on and they eat bugs.</v>

1130
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 5>Eat ever go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's dumb.</v>

1131
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:29.370
<v Speaker 5>That's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they don't have observed the </v>

1132
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.280
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole theory does make it makes no </v>

1133
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.280
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1134
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.561
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they do what they've observed the </v>

1135
00:48:33.561 --> 00:48:33.561
<v Speaker 5>meeting mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So observe other long time ago,</v>

1136
00:48:33.561 --> 00:48:36.280
<v Speaker 5>but no on monkeys now he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1137
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:39.650
<v Speaker 5>a lot of animals like target psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 5>substances like rain,</v>

1138
00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 5>beard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>target,</v>

1139
00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.810
<v Speaker 5>the Amanita mushrooms in Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1140
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.820
<v Speaker 5>they're famous for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like knock people over to get the </v>

1141
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:47.820
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fucking love them.</v>

1142
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.100
<v Speaker 5>I dog used to knock shit over to get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>my.</v>

1143
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:55.280
<v Speaker 5>We'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really like little buckets and he'd just</v>

1144
00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.070
<v Speaker 5>go and I come back and he'd be acting </v>
<v Speaker 5>all weird and look in the ash tray.</v>

1145
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:02.210
<v Speaker 5>It's just like all empty and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1146
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 5>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this subject is a very controversial one</v>

1147
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.390
<v Speaker 5>because whenever you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1148
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people have a very strong </v>

1149
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.510
<v Speaker 5>opinion against this idea and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

1150
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

1151
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1152
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:15.430
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1153
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 5>think about what the fuck mushrooms do </v>
<v Speaker 5>do to you if you've done it,</v>

1154
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.260
<v Speaker 5>if you've ever done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what they do.</v>

1155
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beyond description,</v>

1156
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 5>your whole world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything around you becomes </v>

1157
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.560
<v Speaker 5>interlocking geometric patterns that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can see through to infinity.</v>

1158
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Just that experience itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is happening?</v>

1159
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Why is it so powerful and why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 5>you Nana mostly positive do that to your</v>

1160
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 5>mind what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it is an agent of evolution,</v>

1161
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.300
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you know,</v>

1162
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:52.310
<v Speaker 5>but you're not being poisoned that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ld 50 rate for siliciden mushrooms is </v>

1163
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.640
<v Speaker 5>like fucking 50 pounds or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like what you have to eat to kill</v>

1164
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:56.410
<v Speaker 5>half the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

1165
00:49:56.411 --> 00:50:01.411
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can't die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about like hundreds of </v>

1166
00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:02.110
<v Speaker 5>times more than the effective dose it </v>
<v Speaker 5>would take to kill you.</v>

1167
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.260
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be a total idiot to die </v>
<v Speaker 5>for mushrooms.</v>

1168
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:09.270
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot in you just </v>

1169
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.270
<v Speaker 5>probably throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

1170
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 5>There were some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody's ever died unless</v>

1171
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:13.150
<v Speaker 5>there's some toxic mold that was on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is very common in my short.</v>

1172
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 5>Not only that mushrooms that look like </v>
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin mushrooms,</v>

1173
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 5>but there's some other fucking one that </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely jacks your system.</v>

1174
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.050
<v Speaker 5>But that's the problem with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could say.</v>

1175
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no mold on these mushrooms.</v>

1176
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:24.600
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to die and there could </v>
<v Speaker 5>be mold on this.</v>

1177
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.260
<v Speaker 5>What you're supposed to be buying or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>buying,</v>

1178
00:50:27.261 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be eating and</v>

1179
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 3>run out of the ground are supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>

1180
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.840
<v Speaker 3>I know this is all subject of what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing to like food.</v>

1181
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.150
<v Speaker 3>We don't let anybody grow their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1182
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:43.151
<v Speaker 3>We in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking really hard to get to so </v>

1183
00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:45.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who's handling it and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys growing it to yourself,</v>

1184
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:50.021
<v Speaker 3>it was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have any God damned backyard or </v>

1185
00:50:50.021 --> 00:50:51.911
<v Speaker 3>in your basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could grow a whole shelf of </v>

1186
00:50:51.911 --> 00:50:51.911
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easiest.</v>

1187
00:50:51.911 --> 00:50:54.941
<v Speaker 3>Fuck a dude who had like Scott Mushrooms</v>

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 5>How do you not know that all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are crazy?</v>

1265
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 5>Because I know a lot of crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1266
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:35.210
<v Speaker 5>People are full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lie a lot.</v>

1267
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 5>You have to always keep that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian always says it best.</v>

1268
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:42.830
<v Speaker 5>You always got to keep what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've always got to keep all doors </v>

1269
00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:42.830
<v Speaker 5>open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you say?</v>

1270
00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about this once before </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it was about Ufos.</v>

1271
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep everything on the table.</v>

1272
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you ever yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Everything on the table.</v>

1273
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Don't just commit to one thing or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other man said when you were speaking </v>

1274
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:55.810
<v Speaker 5>about life and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

1275
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about this is the nuttiest fucking</v>

1276
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:02.871
<v Speaker 5>shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a new study that they found it </v>

1277
00:54:02.871 --> 00:54:05.570
<v Speaker 5>and that life today resembles life of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>billion years ago,</v>

1278
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 5>or cancer today.</v>

1279
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it resembles life of a billion years </v>

1280
00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:12.690
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That I'm going to try to find the.</v>

1281
00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 5>It's very scary because what it implies </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

1282
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we came out of,</v>

1283
00:54:17.431 --> 00:54:19.030
<v Speaker 5>we came out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this right here.</v>

1284
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Here's the article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life resemble a cancer cells resembled </v>

1285
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 5>life 1 billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have all these,</v>

1286
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these comparisons.</v>

1287
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:27.380
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this all,</v>

1288
00:54:27.381 --> 00:54:32.381
<v Speaker 5>like some serious scientific study about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the origins of life and the origins of </v>

1289
00:54:32.381 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea,</v>

1290
00:54:32.731 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 5>and this is where it could be completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>insane,</v>

1291
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:40.130
<v Speaker 5>but the idea is if human life becomes so</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and chaotic and so unnatural </v>

1292
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.590
<v Speaker 5>and so polluted by chemicals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroyed by ideology and nonsense,</v>

1293
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.720
<v Speaker 5>and we just breed ourselves down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>mush.</v>

1294
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:57.260
<v Speaker 5>This is the mush.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What this is is this is what started </v>

1295
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.681
<v Speaker 5>life in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life was just a series of fucking cells </v>

1296
00:55:00.681 --> 00:55:04.281
<v Speaker 5>that grew out of control and became </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually human beings and for this </v>

1297
00:55:04.281 --> 00:55:08.571
<v Speaker 5>shit to be growing inside of us at an </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever expanding rate constantly is like </v>

1298
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 5>the primordial ooze trying to reclaim </v>
<v Speaker 5>its creation.</v>

1299
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.320
<v Speaker 5>This is the universal fucking extra </v>
<v Speaker 5>sketch and they're shaking it right now.</v>

1300
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 5>Wrap your fucking head around that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what cancer is,</v>

1301
00:55:19.981 --> 00:55:24.981
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What cancer is is absolute proof </v>

1302
00:55:24.981 --> 00:55:27.231
<v Speaker 5>positive that this is the wrong path and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the universe is slowly swallowing the </v>

1303
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 5>human race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back up,</v>

1304
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 5>wrap your shit around that homey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the universe is know as art.</v>

1305
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1306
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.880
<v Speaker 5>and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't look at it that way.</v>

1307
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:40.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're obviously just learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1308
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:45.351
<v Speaker 5>but we don't look at it as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that could be reversed that </v>

1309
00:55:45.351 --> 00:55:45.690
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at like,</v>

1310
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're talking about like cancer of </v>

1311
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the $10,000</v>

1312
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 5>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1313
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.420
<v Speaker 5>The people didn't get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't get cancer.</v>

1314
00:55:52.421 --> 00:55:57.421
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of scientists that </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe that all cancer is within the </v>

1315
00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.170
<v Speaker 5>industrial age and previously before </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1316
00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 5>any exposure to chemicals and things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Cortina just shit,</v>

1317
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.500
<v Speaker 5>but this shit doesn't really exist in </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>

1318
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 5>And when you're eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1319
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.820
<v Speaker 5>a primate or um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1320
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Paleo Diet,</v>

1321
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolve vegetables and all,</v>

1322
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1323
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:17.390
<v Speaker 5>clean animals that you kill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're not getting introduced to </v>

1324
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 5>any of the shit that creates cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know if that's right or no.</v>

1325
00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:24.141
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how the fuck they could </v>

1326
00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:24.141
<v Speaker 5>ever prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:24.141
<v Speaker 5>They would have to go back in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1328
00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:24.141
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>1,000</v>

1329
00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 5>years or whatever the fuck it was before</v>
<v Speaker 5>people ever figured out how to fuck with</v>

1330
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 5>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is at 10,000</v>

1331
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even,</v>

1332
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.620
<v Speaker 5>probably only a couple chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1333
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 5>when was the first cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When was the first cancer ever recorded?</v>

1334
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a really interesting thing,</v>

1335
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:43.711
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because let's say let's just get crazy </v>

1336
00:56:43.711 --> 00:56:46.201
<v Speaker 5>and let's give it a few thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say the first cancer started like </v>

1337
00:56:46.201 --> 00:56:46.201
<v Speaker 5>2000 years ago.</v>

1338
00:56:46.201 --> 00:56:47.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that is the case,</v>

1339
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:52.370
<v Speaker 5>we think about what a short period of </v>
<v Speaker 5>time that is 2000 years to tonight to </v>

1340
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 5>today and you compare how much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have cancer now and how many more</v>

1341
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 5>people are around now than before in </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly we're working on a cure for.</v>

1342
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 5>We're going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to figure it out.</v>

1343
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1344
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1345
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is cancer life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's life growing out of control and the</v>

1346
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 5>way to get this is the crazy thing about</v>
<v Speaker 5>life growing out of control and cancer,</v>

1347
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 5>the way they kill it is it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>poison the shit out of you.</v>

1348
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.460
<v Speaker 5>They poisoned the shit out of you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they hope that this,</v>

1349
00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 5>this thing dies before the host does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what chemotherapy is.</v>

1350
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 5>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrifying notion.</v>

1351
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:30.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have a parasite inside you</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're going to slowly bring you to </v>

1352
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:31.480
<v Speaker 5>death's door and hopefully it'll kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>the parasite.</v>

1353
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.870
<v Speaker 5>And then you get to like start eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>oatmeal again and walking without a </v>

1354
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.870
<v Speaker 5>limp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as soon as that happens,</v>

1355
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 5>get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1356
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 5>your friend is back for another fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>round,</v>

1357
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 5>grabs a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to choke you and drag you to the </v>

1358
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Is it genetic?</v>

1378
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Because idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1379
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time we grew up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just like eating,</v>

1380
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.940
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a big family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brothers and sisters,</v>

1381
00:58:29.941 --> 00:58:33.360
<v Speaker 2>so we'd like we'd eat hot dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hamburger helper and,</v>

1382
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.420
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know where it can come from </v>

1383
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be genetic and like all that </v>

1384
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1385
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.821
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my aunt died of the same thing when she </v>

1386
00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:48.030
<v Speaker 2>was 24 like way back when she was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's somewhat in the genetics,</v>

1387
00:58:48.031 --> 00:58:49.410
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>

1388
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 2>May Not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1389
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I do go to a doctor like twice a year or</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1390
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to the doctor probably for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that reason.</v>

1391
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1392
00:58:57.631 --> 00:58:59.040
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1393
00:58:59.041 --> 00:58:59.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1394
00:58:59.941 --> 00:59:01.050
<v Speaker 2>really healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1395
00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1396
00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.050
<v Speaker 5>I know a dude who eats really brown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got cancer right now.</v>

1397
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's got really pale skin and he's </v>

1399
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.751
<v Speaker 5>always out in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently it got some skin cancer and </v>

1400
00:59:11.751 --> 00:59:14.211
<v Speaker 5>cancer and eats terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 5>no vitamins.</v>

1402
00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.530
<v Speaker 5>So homeboys got to start eating like </v>

<v Speaker 5>serious,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Very leafy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thick,</v>

1405
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:24.051
<v Speaker 5>green vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I do that man and I got really </v>

1406
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:24.051
<v Speaker 5>heavily</v>

1407
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 3>into like eating salads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big salads every day.</v>

1408
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Really feel way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really amazing.</v>

1409
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1410
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.320
<v Speaker 3>most of our food is so fucking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

1411
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can get something.</v>

1412
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 3>There's something out of eating plants </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eating live things,</v>

1413
00:59:35.901 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really do get something from it.</v>

1414
00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is you've gotta get you </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotTa,</v>

1415
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 3>get fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organic like in Montreal,</v>

1416
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.790
<v Speaker 3>like I just went back there last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's snow storm,</v>

1417
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:51.791
<v Speaker 3>like nothing fresh is growing there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything's important from all </v>

1418
00:59:51.791 --> 00:59:55.871
<v Speaker 3>around the world sprayed with Kent if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting organic and fresh </v>

1419
00:59:55.871 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 3>like the shit's been in a freezer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in chemicals,</v>

1420
00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.020
<v Speaker 3>get a wash your lettuce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother worked at uh,</v>

1421
01:00:01.021 --> 01:00:06.021
<v Speaker 3>a fruit and vegetable place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said they used to take the celery </v>

1422
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:07.390
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to wear gloves when you like.</v>

1423
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 3>They'd unloaded from the boxes and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the front because he'd get burns </v>

1424
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.540
<v Speaker 3>on his hands from the chemicals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were on the celery.</v>

1425
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I think about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're putting that in your body man.</v>

1426
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 3>And how long do you have to wash the </v>
<v Speaker 3>salary for that shit to get?</v>

1427
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.030
<v Speaker 3>How long would it take before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>started getting burns?</v>

1428
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said like you write like you learn </v>

1429
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:28.680
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

1430
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you handle it a bit and it's just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals,</v>

1431
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 3>especially on celery for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1432
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I love salary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1433
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:33.520
<v Speaker 3>I made celery juice all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Well if you get then once again organic </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1435
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.500
<v Speaker 3>but still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1436
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a lot of organic is bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to label it as organic and it's not </v>

1437
01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.880
<v Speaker 3>really organic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does organic stand for?</v>

1438
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1439
01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:46.160
<v Speaker 3>What is the actual definition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>organic?</v>

1440
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Does it mean no chemicals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No pesticides.</v>

1441
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:53.770
<v Speaker 3>No genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's supposed to </v>

1442
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:53.770
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boast to me then.</v>

1443
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:57.310
<v Speaker 3>But as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch those documentaries like food </v>

1444
01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:57.310
<v Speaker 3>inc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's just the,</v>

1445
01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetically modified.</v>

1446
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.710
<v Speaker 3>This shit's like flies all over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>

1447
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1448
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that's what's really crazy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified crops is how they </v>

1449
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.431
<v Speaker 3>affect other farmers have gotten sued </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the shit flew through the air </v>

1450
01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 3>and landed on their fields and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>found there these crops and they,</v>

1451
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 3>they'll do a test on them and then these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys have to go to court and they want </v>

1452
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 3>money from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's the most evil shit ever.</v>

1453
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Monsanto is one of the most evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations ever,</v>

1454
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:27.550
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was some fucking thing online </v>

1455
01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.060
<v Speaker 3>about them buying blackwater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1456
01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they did,</v>

1457
01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 3>but there was like people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the end of the world,</v>

1458
01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 3>just like the most evil organizations </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1459
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 3>And one's going to buy the other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to become one massive,</v>

1460
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 3>super evil organization.</v>

1461
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to fuck over the whole world.</v>

1462
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:43.610
<v Speaker 3>They want to take over the food </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

1463
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 3>They want to make sure that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay them for their crops.</v>

1464
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.390
<v Speaker 3>You don't own your crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't own the seed.</v>

1465
01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 3>You can't replant the seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got an army.</v>

1466
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:57.130
<v Speaker 3>We got an army that army that will do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything we tapped.</v>

1467
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I need to find out if that actually is </v>
<v Speaker 3>still happening or if it was bullshit or</v>

1468
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:03.590
<v Speaker 3>if they just hired him for something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1469
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this great French documentary </v>

1470
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.691
<v Speaker 3>life according to Monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is on Google that people should </v>

1471
01:02:10.691 --> 01:02:10.691
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1472
01:02:10.691 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 3>What's the seed called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that doesn't,</v>

1473
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1474

<v Speaker 3>you have to keep buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The not the shot.</v>

1475
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 3>This shotgun there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something.</v>

1476
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a</v>

1477
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 2>seat that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1478
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.200

<v Speaker 2>it's not a crop that will keep coming </v>

1479
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:26.200
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to plant it every season.</v>

1480
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck modified seed that you have to </v>

1481
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:34.731
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The farmers are at Monsanto's mercy </v>

1482
01:02:34.731 --> 01:02:35.630
<v Speaker 2>because they can't just keep some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crops and like they,</v>

1483
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>these things die every year to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>buying.</v>

1484
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>They've engineered dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 2>They engineered the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this crazy world anyway.</v>

1486
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1487
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've looked at them.</v>

1488
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1489
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 5>Here's the answer there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're hiding it because it's a,</v>

1490
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 5>they've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one,</v>

1491
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.540
<v Speaker 5>one article said Monsanto Buys </v>
<v Speaker 5>Blackwater and then another argument or </v>

1492

<v Speaker 5>This isn't being discussed.</v>

1499
01:03:21.761 --> 01:03:23.410
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants to talk about how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>black guys,</v>

1500
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.460
<v Speaker 5>Kim Kardashians.</v>

1501
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to know gay people </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't get married.</v>

1502
01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has taken over the world and you're</v>

1503
01:03:30.301 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 2>worried about fucking guys getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

1504
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 5>Crazy thing is people think this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

1505
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.950
<v Speaker 5>This is like hippie nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All this fucking.</v>

1506
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1507
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1508
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1509
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:41.820
<v Speaker 5>This is big business is what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the biggest business in the world.</v>

1510
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.120
<v Speaker 5>The number one business in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>besides drugs is food and the only </v>

1511
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:47.730
<v Speaker 5>reason why drugs is more than foods </v>
<v Speaker 5>because drugs is illegal.</v>

1512
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>foods worth way more than drugs.</v>

1513
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.810
<v Speaker 5>Drugs should be cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're illegal.</v>

1514
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean fuck man,</v>

1515
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's probably not even close anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More people spend way more money on food</v>

1516
01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:58.480
<v Speaker 5>than drugs anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though drugs are illegal.</v>

1517
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 5>Even though I forget what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a mania would.</v>

1518
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.740
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would have been off the </v>

1519
01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:06.740
<v Speaker 5>charts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway.</v>

1520
01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 5>So how the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could this happen?</v>

1521
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>generation of people?</v>

1532
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>No you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has a fucking clue.</v>

<v Speaker 2>will be out on the market for people to </v>

1537
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

1538
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.110
<v Speaker 5>There's a fish that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1540
01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.200
<v Speaker 5>whenever an animal comes from another </v>
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem and invades as an alien thing </v>

1541
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.100
<v Speaker 5>can ruin everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1543
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:06.350
<v Speaker 5>think that's the name of the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a fish that I believe it's from</v>

1544
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:11.211
<v Speaker 5>Africa.</v>

<v Speaker 5>kill something,</v>

1586
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 5>but there's something so primal about </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching those fucking things.</v>

1587
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:56.420
<v Speaker 5>Just to attack a school of goldfish and </v>

<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.970
<v Speaker 5>I used to get a bag of goldfish and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would sit.</v>

1590
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 5>I'd pull my bar stool in front of this </v>

<v Speaker 5>they just attack them.</v>

1607
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:42.860
<v Speaker 5>They just tack them and fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So um,</v>

1608
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:48.060
<v Speaker 5>I would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dumped the goldfish in there and they </v>

1609
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 5>would look at the goldfish for a second </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they would like slowly move closer,</v>

1610
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:54.541
<v Speaker 5>slowly move closer and then one of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>would go for it and when one of them </v>

1611
01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:54.690
<v Speaker 5>would go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would just dart,</v>

1612
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.780
<v Speaker 5>snap and cut a goldfish in half and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>the blood would be in the water and then</v>

1613
01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 5>it was on like donkey Kong.</v>

1614
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:05.700
<v Speaker 5>And then I would sit there and watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>them go back and forth and chasing them </v>

1615
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 5>around these little driftwood things and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1616
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 5>And the Goldfish don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck is going on.</v>

1617
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.910
<v Speaker 5>And they're just getting cut down like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Goddamn horror movie.</v>

1618
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:17.110

<v Speaker 5>they're fucking savage stealing dead </v>

1619
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:19.080

<v Speaker 5>Like one's got a half a goldfish.</v>

1620
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 5>The other one comes up and bite it off </v>
<v Speaker 5>of his face.</v>

1621
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 5>So after like a good,</v>

<v Speaker 5>When they would go nuts,</v>

1623
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.320
<v Speaker 5>they would be missing lips and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their lips would be because there would </v>

1624
01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 5>be stealing from each other and they cut</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own lips off,</v>

1625
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 5>so they were always like this.</v>

01:08:42.821 --> 01:08:46.540
<v Speaker 5>off just so they can see the white teeth</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you pull them out and you remove </v>

1630
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.291
<v Speaker 5>their lips and then you put them back in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the water and they swim around and they </v>

1631
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:50.291

1665
01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:22.511
<v Speaker 5>bring when I would live in Colorado.</v>

1666
01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 5>When I lived in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to carry a gun.</v>

1667
01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:26.060
<v Speaker 5>I carry two guns once a gun always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Mace.</v>

1668
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I bring Mace because bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't really want to shoot bears </v>

1669
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.510
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because first of all,</v>

1670
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 5>the nine millimeter you shoot a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guess what?</v>

1671
01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:35.090
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just going to make them really,</v>

1672
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:37.170
<v Speaker 5>really fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1673
01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.380
<v Speaker 5>And Colorado doesn't have too many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grizzlies are.</v>

1674
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it was black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they could.</v>

1675
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're in Montana.</v>

1676
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:45.250
<v Speaker 5>They're in a lot of places you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

1677
01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:50.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean they don't have a real accurate </v>
<v Speaker 5>number of how many grizzlies are out </v>

1678
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:53.831
<v Speaker 5>there and if they've found a few in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Colorado it was because there was a zoo </v>

1679
01:10:53.831 --> 01:10:55.850
<v Speaker 5>that we went to that they had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>grizzlies that were in the zoo.</v>

1680
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 5>And the reason why they had them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was because they had gotten to use</v>

1681
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:04.511
<v Speaker 5>to people and they start jacking </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's garbage and once they start </v>

1682
01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:04.511
<v Speaker 5>jacking your garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

1683
01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 5>They know that that's a food source and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they never quit.</v>

1684
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't ever move on to a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood.</v>

1685
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:13.390
<v Speaker 5>They just will camp out and just jack </v>
<v Speaker 5>your garbage every night so it becomes </v>

1686
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 5>an issue and they have to kidnap him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it,</v>

1689
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:23.091
<v Speaker 5>but I did see a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But seeing a bear in the zoo and just </v>

1690
01:11:23.091 --> 01:11:26.691
<v Speaker 5>thinking about this thing is allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>roam around in the same area as you </v>

1736
01:13:11.571 --> 01:13:11.571
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding.</v>

1737

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.080
<v Speaker 5>He actually said that she's feeling her </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit saying that it's warm because you </v>

1740
01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.270
<v Speaker 5>imagine if he was doing that to a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman,</v>

1741
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.060
<v Speaker 5>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's just as bizarre.</v>

1745
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Just as bizarre to be doing that with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking bear.</v>

1746
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:36.120
<v Speaker 5>You weird.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's um,</v>

1749
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:43.340
<v Speaker 5>Werner Herzog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking fascinating because it seems </v>

1750
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.250
<v Speaker 5>like Werner Herzog is not in on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke,</v>

1751
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:49.251
<v Speaker 5>which makes it even more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like his guy is a brilliant </v>

1752
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 5>documentarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he know how hilarious is,</v>

1753
01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:53.100
<v Speaker 5>is because it doesn't appear that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>does because it's doesn't seem like he's</v>

1754
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 5>playing it off that way at all.</v>

1755
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.160
<v Speaker 5>And even when he talks to the woman at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the end,</v>

1756
01:13:56.161 --> 01:14:01.161
<v Speaker 5>I would love to sit down with him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like off the record and asked him a </v>

1757
01:14:01.161 --> 01:14:01.161
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to go blue.</v>

1758
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that was funny when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were doing it?</v>

1759
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's God damn brilliant dude.</v>

1760
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.440
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny.</v>

1761
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:12.470
<v Speaker 5>I was like great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christopher guest movie deadpan </v>

1762
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 5>everybody to bring in like the sheriff </v>
<v Speaker 5>from up in Alaska.</v>

1763
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Well I knew he was going to get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble up there.</v>

1764
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:17.710
<v Speaker 5>These interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>

1765
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 5>and they're talking about how like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how he had to,</v>

1766
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:25.741
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize the body and now they had to </v>

1767
01:14:25.741 --> 01:14:25.741
<v Speaker 5>shoot the bear because the bear was </v>
<v Speaker 5>still there,</v>

1768
01:14:25.741 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 5>like guarding over the bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 5>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy had flown over.</v>

1770
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:33.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to kill them once they start </v>

1771
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:33.330
<v Speaker 5>killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to cry.</v>

1772
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:33.330
<v Speaker 5>But it was an old what it was.</v>

1773
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Was he the guy they called it suicide by</v>
<v Speaker 5>bear.</v>

1774
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.240
<v Speaker 5>And what happened was the guy had just </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to stay way past.</v>

1775
01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to and when you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain point in time,</v>

1776
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:48.030
<v Speaker 5>the bears that are conscious or that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>up that aren't hibernating or all the </v>

1777
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:51.571
<v Speaker 5>ones who are dying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all really old and the really </v>

1778
01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 5>old bears get desperate and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't get any food.</v>

1779
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 5>And they started killing their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>babies.</v>

1780
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:59.370
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see bears killed their own </v>

1781
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.351
<v Speaker 5>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to get the fuck out of </v>

1782
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:01.351
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1783
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:01.351
<v Speaker 5>Because if they're killing their babies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're desperate.</v>

1784
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:01.351
<v Speaker 5>It's fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1785
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 5>they're eating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat their own goddamn babies.</v>

1786
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1787
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.500
<v Speaker 5>he basically went back and like October,</v>
<v Speaker 5>November when the bears are camping and </v>

1788
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.110
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a bear killed him and took a long </v>

1789
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 5>time and there's a video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no,</v>

1790
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:16.330
<v Speaker 5>there's no image because the lens cap </v>
<v Speaker 5>was on,</v>

1791
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.480
<v Speaker 5>but the camera was running and they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>like seven minutes of him getting torn </v>

1792
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.440
<v Speaker 5>apart by bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by this one bear.</v>

1793
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 5>And because the thing about bears is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just start eating.</v>

1794
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:31.651
<v Speaker 5>You see a real carnivore or rather real </v>
<v Speaker 5>Predator like a cat.</v>

1795
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.500
<v Speaker 5>Cats kill you first because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep killing things and they don't want </v>

1796
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 5>to have to worry about fighting you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1797
01:15:38.651 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 5>the hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hyenas just started eating.</v>

1798
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.110
<v Speaker 5>And that's the same with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bears that get you down.</v>

1799
01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:46.020
<v Speaker 5>They just started eating monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chimps,</v>

1800
01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:48.220
<v Speaker 5>chimps kill monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just eat them.</v>

1801
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 5>They don't kill them first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's videos of chimps screaming while</v>

1802
01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:57.751
<v Speaker 5>I'm or monkeys rather screaming while </v>
<v Speaker 5>the chip has a hold of it's little body </v>

1803
01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:01.570
<v Speaker 5>and his biting its legs off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling it apart.</v>

1804
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.070
<v Speaker 5>And this monkey score reaming and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like a little person.</v>

1805
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:11.250
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a weird little person in </v>
<v Speaker 5>an outfit and it's getting ripped apart </v>

1806
01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 5>by this champ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's this chewing on it.</v>

1807
01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking dark dude.</v>

1808
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.650
<v Speaker 5>And that's what bears do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what bear did.</v>

1809
01:16:18.651 --> 01:16:22.270
<v Speaker 5>The Timothy Treadwell just aidem for </v>
<v Speaker 5>seven minutes until he died somewhere.</v>

1810
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 5>That footage exists to no video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1811
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Only audio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no video footage.</v>

1812
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Werner Herzog listened to it.</v>

1813
01:16:27.971 --> 01:16:32.971
<v Speaker 5>That fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't play it for us and he said </v>

1814
01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:32.971
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is too much for people to handle.</v>

1815
01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:36.340
<v Speaker 5>We need to burn this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>burn this like bitch.</v>

1816
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Some the people decide maybe just being </v>
<v Speaker 5>a little over reactive.</v>

1817
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

1818
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.370
<v Speaker 5>when did they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you shoot that?</v>

1819
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 5>How long ago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few years ago.</v>

1820
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.450
<v Speaker 5>It's like 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

1821
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.840
<v Speaker 5>Maybe even more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've been like 2004 on watch this</v>

1822
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:55.850
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time somebody gets his head </v>

1823

<v Speaker 5>chopped off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my brother's like,</v>

1824
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.850

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1825
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.850
<v Speaker 5>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1826
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.700
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing graphic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two thousand five.</v>

1827
01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:59.740
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing graphic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1828
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 5>they don't really show you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they say the way they found out</v>

1829
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:07.060
<v Speaker 5>that the guy had died was that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they flew in like with some supplies for</v>

1830
01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:09.410
<v Speaker 5>them and as the guy was flying in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>plane,</v>

1831
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:13.490
<v Speaker 5>he saw a bear that was out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you thought was unusual and he saw</v>

1832

<v Speaker 5>Nothing of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It had all been absorbed.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They finally were a couple of rib bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really amazing.</v>

1845
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about this giant grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 5>bear,</v>

1846
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:52.931
<v Speaker 5>I mean they had photos of the bear and </v>
<v Speaker 5>video footage of the bear from previous </v>

1847
01:17:52.931 --> 01:17:57.010
<v Speaker 5>stuff that he had gotten before the bear</v>
<v Speaker 5>killed him back when they were salmon </v>

1848
01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:57.010
<v Speaker 5>running like they got the bear eating </v>

<v Speaker 5>months it's gone get really big before </v>
<v Speaker 5>you watch it though.</v>

1851
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:08.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the greatest documentaries </v>

1852
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:08.840
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most unintentional comedy,</v>

1853
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 5>I think ever in a document that Richard </v>
<v Speaker 5>Simmons out in the woods and colony </v>

1854
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:17.910
<v Speaker 5>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is like the Coen brothers did </v>

1855
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.950
<v Speaker 5>it as a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1856
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I was amazed,</v>

1857
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of perfect that the bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>ate him.</v>

1858
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Like in terms of the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sure hurts.</v>

<v Speaker 5>documentary after the guy died.</v>

1861
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1864
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 5>camera and he would look into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>camera.</v>

1865

<v Speaker 5>I'm out here alone in this far as </v>
<v Speaker 5>protecting these bears because no one </v>

01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:20.801
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I tell them.</v>

1951
01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:20.801
<v Speaker 2>Tell people</v>

1952
01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:23.300
<v Speaker 5>if there were three werewolves in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

1953
01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.360
<v Speaker 5>fact proven three werewolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you ever be in the woods at night </v>

1954
01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.180
<v Speaker 5>on a full moon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why the fuck would you take that chance?</v>

1955
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:33.600
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1956
01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:38.710
<v Speaker 5>well there's a million sharks you fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're not just sharks when it's a </v>

1957
01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:42.311
<v Speaker 5>full moon there sharks every day and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't even stop because if they </v>

1958
01:22:42.311 --> 01:22:42.311
<v Speaker 5>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they drowned.</v>

1959
01:22:42.311 --> 01:22:46.270
<v Speaker 5>So they have to keep swimming and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to keep beating navy shoes and </v>

1960
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.880
<v Speaker 5>license plates and tires and they'll eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1961
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.160
<v Speaker 5>They'll eat you bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll eat you quick.</v>

1962
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.510
<v Speaker 5>They take giant bites out of you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fucking.</v>

1963
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:54.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure surfing is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it ain't that off.</v>

1964
01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I wear shoes in the ocean and wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even fight like the biggest thing ever.</v>

1965
01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Can we save an oculus on that smart </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking right there?</v>

1966
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean people like we'll always like,</v>

1967
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 5>like this is another subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people who might not be so scared of</v>

1968
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:13.951
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so paranoid of things like obviously a </v>

1969
01:23:13.951 --> 01:23:13.951
<v Speaker 5>lot of this is for entertainment folks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>ocean,</v>

1971
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 5>but the point being logically and </v>
<v Speaker 5>realistically,</v>

1972
01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to die eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely,</v>

1973
01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:25.890

<v Speaker 5>They've never seen anything like it </v>

2060
01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.751
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they've had to put bounties on </v>

2061
01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:01.751
<v Speaker 5>wolves heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're putting 210.</v>

<v Speaker 5>a because it's pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It might be euro's 200,</v>

2064
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 5>10 euros.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably euro's,</v>

2065
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:08.290
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they go into the year?</v>

2066
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:11.500
<v Speaker 5>That was a vodka by the way.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was figure.</v>

2068
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:14.780
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this isn't a podcast.</v>

2069
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.560
<v Speaker 5>How did they find it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did they get to volunteer?</v>

2070
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:22.930
<v Speaker 5>I searched it and it says a wolf attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Videos of viral ad for vodka brand.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's pretty.</v>

2073
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.730
<v Speaker 5>It does seem a little bit to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well filmed.</v>

2074
01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Did it too good of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>

2075
01:27:35.721 --> 01:27:38.000
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about this shit man.</v>

2076
01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:38.370
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2077
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:43.430
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the is up there are minus 49 degrees </v>

2078
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:46.961
<v Speaker 5>Celsius and it killed off all the normal</v>
<v Speaker 5>prey of these wolves says wolves thrive </v>

2079
01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:50.210
<v Speaker 5>in cold weather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of animals.</v>

2080
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.270
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

2081
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.220
<v Speaker 5>Just cue that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we'll have to watch this guy's gay ad</v>

2082
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:00.680
<v Speaker 5>presents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I present here it goes.</v>

2083
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see that looks like to.</v>

2084
01:28:03.591 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Well framed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2085
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.370
<v Speaker 5>that's a good traffic camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both,</v>

2086
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:11.210
<v Speaker 5>both cars are in frame,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's pretty dope man.</v>

2087
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 5>Alive when it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish it was real.</v>

2088
01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:16.150
<v Speaker 5>She was aware it wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:21.370
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about that temperature </v>

2090
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:21.370
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forty nine degrees Celsius.</v>

2091
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:24.230
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Edmonton minus 49 degrees.</v>

2092
01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2094
01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:31.180
<v Speaker 5>these wolves have nothing to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they all figured out how to get </v>

2095
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:31.180
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this population,</v>

2096
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:35.300
<v Speaker 5>this town is only 1300 people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So wrap your head around that.</v>

2097
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.890
<v Speaker 5>1,300</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2098
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 5>400 wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So almost for every three,</v>

2099
01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 5>three people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a wolf.</v>

2100
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:46.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck man.</v>

2101
01:28:46.611 --> 01:28:50.870
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every three people there's a wolf.</v>

2102
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:54.920
<v Speaker 5>The chances of you dying by wolf attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

2103
01:28:55.010 --> 01:29:00.010
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the chances of you dying of old </v>

2104
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:01.571
<v Speaker 5>age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying and it's just starting </v>

2105
01:29:01.571 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 5>to happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's been two instances in the last,</v>

2106
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 5>like fucking 100 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they've both been within the last 10</v>

2107
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>years of people getting killed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves.</v>

2108
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:13.491
<v Speaker 5>It's on record.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to think that like wolves are </v>

2109
01:29:13.491 --> 01:29:13.491
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2110
01:29:13.491 --> 01:29:13.491
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs,</v>

2111
01:29:13.491 --> 01:29:13.491
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like Randall's.</v>

2112
01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking killers.</v>

2113
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.740
<v Speaker 5>They'll kill you too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2114
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 5>if they catch you alone.</v>

2115
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.370
<v Speaker 5>We used to have like all the member,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Old Walt Disney movies,</v>

2116
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 5>there was a woes like try to get beauty </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the beast.</v>

2117
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 5>The wolf would fucking sneak up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2118
01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to fucking fight off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves that wanted to kill beauty.</v>

2119
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that shit,</v>

2120
01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 5>they attacked them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>

2121
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.120
<v Speaker 5>We just have fucked them over so bad in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this country that we started to have </v>

2122
01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:38.120
<v Speaker 5>respect for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2123
01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.390
<v Speaker 5>like wolves aren't so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're cool man.</v>

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.660
<v Speaker 5>We need them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're beautiful.</v>

2125
01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they represent freedom.</v>

2126
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:48.240
<v Speaker 5>Rules represented freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a never think about walls,</v>

2127
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:53.241
<v Speaker 5>but this guy thinks about was everyday I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about because I'm closer to an </v>

2128
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:56.270
<v Speaker 5>animal than you are for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one percent DNA differential,</v>

2129
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.160
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is between humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>and chimpanzees.</v>

2130
01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:02.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm closer to Mr Cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Goddammit.</v>

2131
01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm too close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go into the woods.</v>

2132
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.560
<v Speaker 5>Some gravitating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gravitate towards wild.</v>

2133
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:09.870
<v Speaker 5>If we lived in or if there was a rain </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest,</v>

2134
01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.790
<v Speaker 5>I'd fucking live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we have a rain forest right here,</v>

2135
01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.850
<v Speaker 5>I figured out how do you kill the bugs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where do you go?</v>

2136
01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Electricity.</v>

2137
01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:19.720
<v Speaker 5>I need to have an area around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we live in a fucking rain forest.</v>

2138
01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 5>It'll be the shit.</v>

2139

2141
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:29.290
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going there.</v>

2142
01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.400
<v Speaker 3>How about spiders to destroy your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones?</v>

2143
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:37.401
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking Brazilian spider that </v>

2144
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:37.401
<v Speaker 3>we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was I thinking?</v>

2145
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm just scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

2146
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm just scared of regular spiders in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>bed because you read that.</v>

2147
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:46.041
<v Speaker 3>Some of these spiders are poisonous here</v>
<v Speaker 3>in California and they hide in your </v>

2148
01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:47.780
<v Speaker 3>shoes and your birch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:49.430
<v Speaker 3>They're black and brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I saw brown outside my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other glue.</v>

2151
01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Speaker 3>So the scary ones because rec looses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do something to your skin.</v>

2152
01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:58.450
<v Speaker 3>It causes your skin to die so it causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>your</v>

2153
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 5>tissue to dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really fucked up,</v>

2154
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:02.520
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Necrosis.</v>

2155
01:31:02.521 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's called and when they bite</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2156
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.080
<v Speaker 5>they unload on you with all this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>toxin and it just crushes your skin.</v>

2157
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.320
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like giant gaping wounds occur </v>
<v Speaker 5>from one little spider bite because all </v>

2158
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>the area around your skin dies and rots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's scary shit,</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2174
01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.850
<v Speaker 5>horse called the Burmese Russell Viper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is to Russell Viper.</v>

2175
01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:11.851
<v Speaker 5>And what these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they caused uncontrollable hemorrhaging </v>

2176
01:32:11.851 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 5>of your pituitary gland where all your </v>
<v Speaker 5>sex hormones are controlled.</v>

2177
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 5>So if you get bit by this fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you survive the bite,</v>

2178
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:19.240
<v Speaker 5>which you probably won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be permanently impotent.</v>

2179
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 5>And you become like a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you lose all your pubic hair,</v>

2180
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 5>you stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you stop producing testosterone,</v>

2181
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 5>your body just gets jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get neutered.</v>

2182
01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:30.670
<v Speaker 5>And if you get neutered by a bite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2183
01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:32.480
<v Speaker 5>this is a python.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2184
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:38.030
<v Speaker 5>With the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the spider does is a spider brakes </v>

2185
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:40.920
<v Speaker 5>your dick by forcing you to have raging </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncontrollable hard ons that you can </v>

2186
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.990
<v Speaker 5>like painful agonizing hormones are hard</v>
<v Speaker 5>ons.</v>

2187
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.130
<v Speaker 5>And when the heart opens over your </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick's broken.</v>

2188
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 5>So either you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either you die.</v>

2189
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:51.080
<v Speaker 5>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way it's the most potent toxic in</v>

2190
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:56.370
<v Speaker 5>any spider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it either kills you or you live and </v>

2191
01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 5>your Dick's broken forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So both animals break your Dick.</v>

2192
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.420
<v Speaker 5>It's just like they're instinctively </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth.</v>

2193
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.440
<v Speaker 5>We're afraid of spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a tiniest bit like,</v>

2194
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.680
<v Speaker 5>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because some of those can fuck you.</v>

2195
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:09.660
<v Speaker 5>Fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 5>There's genetic memories I'm absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>convinced.</v>

2197
01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:14.110
<v Speaker 5>And I've read about it before where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2198
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 5>this guy I'm a rupert sheldrake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was talking about,</v>

2199
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:22.200
<v Speaker 5>he's an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's an evolutionary </v>

2200
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.581
<v Speaker 5>biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was talking about how animals </v>

2201
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:26.280
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what people are really terrifying of </v>

2202
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.531
<v Speaker 5>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like no matter what the real dangers of </v>

2203
01:33:28.531 --> 01:33:31.231
<v Speaker 5>your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a child and you live in New </v>

2204
01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:31.231
<v Speaker 5>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2205
01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:34.141
<v Speaker 5>you're not worried about car accidents </v>
<v Speaker 5>or rapists or you're worried about </v>

2206
01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:37.741
<v Speaker 5>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason being is because there's </v>

2207
01:33:37.741 --> 01:33:40.170
<v Speaker 5>some ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient memories of us when we used to </v>

2208
01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:40.170
<v Speaker 5>get killed by Jaguars and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2209
01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 5>and we're scared of the night and we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>scared of monsters because that's really</v>

2210
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 5>what they were a man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2211
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:47.230
<v Speaker 5>and the ones that survived of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he carried this incredibly potent,</v>

2212
01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:48.640
<v Speaker 5>terrifying memory.</v>

2213
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 5>And it's actually in printed into people</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetically.</v>

2214
01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have this idea of instincts,</v>

2215
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:56.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people have certain instincts.</v>

2216
01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 5>But then what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2217
01:33:58.151 --> 01:33:59.480
<v Speaker 5>what his instincts mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2218
01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:00.190
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2219
01:34:00.191 --> 01:34:01.510
<v Speaker 5>something already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2220
01:34:01.511 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you know something already?</v>

2221
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:07.771
<v Speaker 5>Is it because of past experience of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancestors in as it comes through your </v>

2222
01:34:07.771 --> 01:34:07.771
<v Speaker 5>genetics?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2223
01:34:07.771 --> 01:34:09.590
<v Speaker 5>how much stuff goes in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much information is now.</v>

2224
01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 5>What they've shown is that means in some</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>

2225
01:34:12.131 --> 01:34:16.270
<v Speaker 5>even useless ones like racism can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>transmitted through genetics.</v>

2226
01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Speaker 5>So the same thing that causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like have an instinct,</v>

2227
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to not do something like don't go,</v>

2228
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:23.960
<v Speaker 5>don't go near Heights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

2229
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.260
<v Speaker 5>you already know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instinctively.</v>

2230
01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:30.300
<v Speaker 5>The same thing is actually you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>transmit other ideas into people's </v>

2231
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:30.800
<v Speaker 5>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2232
01:34:30.801 --> 01:34:33.580
<v Speaker 5>you can transmit even talent maybe into </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's heads.</v>

2233
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.640
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fucking tripping when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about it because we don't know.</v>

2234
01:34:36.641 --> 01:34:39.670
<v Speaker 5>We don't have a documentation of where </v>
<v Speaker 5>all our information comes from.</v>

2235
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:44.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of your information is from </v>

2236
01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:46.441
<v Speaker 5>your ancestors?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much of it is from all these people </v>

2237
01:34:46.441 --> 01:34:49.411
<v Speaker 5>that have lived before you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have made mistakes and learn from </v>

2238
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 5>them and you sort of have this internal </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom thing going on because of that.</v>

2239
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:52.170
<v Speaker 5>I believe that totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2240
01:34:52.171 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you meet someone who is wise beyond</v>

2241
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 5>their years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2242
01:34:55.210 --> 01:35:00.210
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it that they've had an incredibly </v>

2243
01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:00.210
<v Speaker 5>life that's</v>

2244
01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:00.440
<v Speaker 3>a possibility or is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2245
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.560
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another they have gotten a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rich history of people who have </v>

2246
01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 3>survived and learn shit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporated into their DNA?</v>

2247
01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2248
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:12.050
<v Speaker 3>And it's very egotistical also to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2250
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2251
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a smart person where I'm very </v>

2252
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 3>careful because I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2253
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2254
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:22.241
<v Speaker 3>you are afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have millions of years of people </v>

2255
01:35:22.241 --> 01:35:22.241
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is bad.</v>

2256
01:35:22.241 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 3>That is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is bad,</v>

2257
01:35:23.721 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 3>that it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not either or.</v>

2258
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:27.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not either or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you certainly have learned.</v>

2259
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You certainly are smart and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2260
01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:33.770
<v Speaker 3>some people will most certainly do learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>better from fucked up situations.</v>

2261
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.210
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them that absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2262
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of buddies who don't learn,</v>

2263
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:39.080
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that going on,</v>

2264
01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:39.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that don't ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn and you just got to constantly </v>

2266
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 3>fucking talk to him about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2267
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Come on really full Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 3>She's got a third Dui and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2269
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:59.261
<v Speaker 3>Like are you like was I see I don't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I am very bad at drinking </v>

2270
01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:03.280
<v Speaker 3>and driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm 30.</v>

2271
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really good at it and I think,</v>

2272
01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how well do you drink and drive?</v>

2273
01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think having a few beers,</v>

2274
01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:18.581
<v Speaker 3>it's considered drinking and driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I probably drink and drive everyday </v>

2275
01:36:18.581 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 3>to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2276
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:25.100
<v Speaker 3>you're just kidding because cops listen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this dummy.</v>

2277
01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 3>They ever pull you over for a fan of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2278
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.170
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying is I get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>

2279
01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Which comedy club you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that anytime you go </v>

2280
01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have maybe a couple of drinks.</v>

2281
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:38.960
<v Speaker 3>You go in your car that's considered </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking and driving.</v>

2282
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:43.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have two beers in you that's </v>

2283
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:43.990
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2284
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:43.990
<v Speaker 3>whenever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever Brian is wrong about something,</v>

2285
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.800
<v Speaker 3>he gets very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows his voice.</v>

2286
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's how much,</v>

2287

<v Speaker 5>dropping like flies and then it just </v>

2499
01:45:30.131 --> 01:45:30.131
<v Speaker 5>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

01:45:30.131 --> 01:45:30.450

<v Speaker 5>what the fuck was easy?</v>

2501
01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.430
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson was.</v>

2502
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It was not fucking the fleshlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird man.</v>

2503
01:45:35.591 --> 01:45:36.490
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2504
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.370
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's up with Magic Johnson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm Kinda freaked out.</v>

2505
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:40.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2506
01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.560
<v Speaker 5>I've heard a bunch of different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't really comment.</v>

2507
01:45:43.561 --> 01:45:48.561
<v Speaker 5>I've heard stories about him taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>medication and I've heard stories that </v>

2508
01:45:48.561 --> 01:45:49.170
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't need the medication anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I heard he started,</v>

2509
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.140
<v Speaker 5>stopped taking the medication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His symptoms started reoccurring.</v>

2510
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.320
<v Speaker 5>The weird thing is that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tests a negative.</v>

2511
01:45:55.321 --> 01:46:00.321
<v Speaker 5>Apparently he taste tests HIV negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the way HIV works is what you </v>

2512
01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:02.760
<v Speaker 5>can really test is you can test for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>antibodies.</v>

2513
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:07.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they can accurately test </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the actual virus inside you.</v>

2514
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.340
<v Speaker 5>Very tricky.</v>

2515
01:46:09.450 --> 01:46:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Well the first guy ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of the who was HIV positive,</v>

2516
01:46:13.471 --> 01:46:16.110
<v Speaker 2>like through like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear how it happened,</v>

2517
01:46:16.111 --> 01:46:21.111
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the first HIV positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cured it somewhere in</v>

2518
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Sweden or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2519
01:46:23.661 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 5>with stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2520
01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:25.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With the stem cells,</v>

2521
01:46:25.941 --> 01:46:26.630
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:46:26.631 --> 01:46:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was recently.</v>

2523
01:46:27.591 --> 01:46:29.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a month ago or so.</v>

2524
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.060
<v Speaker 5>How much should they get accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 5>with stem cells?</v>

2525
01:46:32.061 --> 01:46:34.790
<v Speaker 5>They have to dance around stuff and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to like,</v>

2526
01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.380
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the skin gun.</v>

2527
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:37.730
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard about this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got?</v>

2528
01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 5>There's a new thing that they've figured</v>
<v Speaker 5>out how to do,</v>

2529
01:46:39.921 --> 01:46:42.830
<v Speaker 5>where they can actually take cultures </v>
<v Speaker 5>from your skin.</v>

2530
01:46:42.831 --> 01:46:47.831
<v Speaker 5>They reproduced with your own stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they spray it in sort of a gun </v>

2531
01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.440
<v Speaker 5>on your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2532
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:53.610
<v Speaker 5>on your skin where it's burned and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>only takes like a certain amount of time</v>

2533
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:55.500
<v Speaker 5>to cultivate like an hour two to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultivate.</v>

2534
01:46:55.620 --> 01:47:00.620
<v Speaker 5>They can do it really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They reproduce this stuff and then they </v>

2535
01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.340
<v Speaker 5>spray it on you and it radically cuts </v>
<v Speaker 5>down healing time radically.</v>

2536
01:47:02.490 --> 01:47:07.490
<v Speaker 5>Like they showed this one guy who had </v>
<v Speaker 5>been burnt in a fire and then he looked </v>

2537
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.490
<v Speaker 5>like he didn't have a fucking scratch on</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2538
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 5>They showed images of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>giant blistering second degree burns big</v>

2539
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:13.880
<v Speaker 5>welts all over his hand and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2540
01:47:13.881 --> 01:47:18.881
<v Speaker 5>they spray this shit on him man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it builds within four days you've </v>

2541
01:47:18.881 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 5>got like Nu skin and it looks healed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a trip and it's all stem cells.</v>

2542
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.180
<v Speaker 5>But people say</v>

2543
01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:25.840
<v Speaker 2>hell though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from his own body though.</v>

2544
01:47:25.841 --> 01:47:27.700
<v Speaker 2>This is what people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to kill babies.</v>

2545
01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Get stem cells there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thinks that everything comes </v>

2546
01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:32.710
<v Speaker 2>from the fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to.</v>

2547
01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And now they have a way to reverse it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to take your own and reverse it to </v>

2548
01:47:37.130 --> 01:47:37.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2549
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I've fucking done what people thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to encourage abortion </v>

2550
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.350
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

2551
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:44.320
<v Speaker 5>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they needed stem cells from fetuses.</v>

2552
01:47:44.321 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know a god damn man.</v>

2553
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let him,</v>

2554
01:47:47.261 --> 01:47:52.261
<v Speaker 5>let him work with Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like these nutty Christians and </v>

2555
01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:55.021
<v Speaker 5>have these Kooky ideas about what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>should and shouldn't do with tissue and </v>

2556
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:55.021
<v Speaker 5>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck,</v>

2557
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:59.881
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what should you do if a girl has an </v>

2558
01:47:59.881 --> 01:47:59.881
<v Speaker 5>abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she just flush it.</v>

2559

<v Speaker 5>You're telling me if there's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can learn in there that can </v>

2560
01:48:03.450 --> 01:48:05.470
<v Speaker 5>unlock the secret to immortality or cure</v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer or whatever the fuck it can do,</v>

2561
01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:10.650
<v Speaker 5>you're telling me you should just throw </v>
<v Speaker 5>it away because it's dead and it's </v>

2562

<v Speaker 5>immoral and that Nina,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow none of the.</v>

2563
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:13.600

<v Speaker 5>but the reality is people are so creepy.</v>

2564
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.450
<v Speaker 5>They probably would start doing </v>

2565
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.590

2646
01:51:42.211 --> 01:51:46.651
<v Speaker 3>Anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's only between friends as a </v>

2647
01:51:46.651 --> 01:51:49.411
<v Speaker 3>goof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know what Joey could say is so </v>

2648
01:51:49.411 --> 01:51:49.411
<v Speaker 3>much different than anything I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

2649
01:51:49.411 --> 01:51:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Jerry says crazy shit sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Som on the year,</v>

2650
01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex.</v>

2651
01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking.</v>

2652
01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:57.120
<v Speaker 3>He's the funniest guy that's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did</v>

2653
01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:58.350
<v Speaker 5>Vegas two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2654
01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:03.440
<v Speaker 5>He came up and he opens up the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the perfect way to do it </v>

2655
01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 5>because Joe is not like an act election.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do look in our.</v>

2656
01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:05.910
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have time to do an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

2657
01:52:05.970 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his pace.</v>

2658
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:11.610
<v Speaker 5>He's got this destructo 15 minute pace </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what he does.</v>

2659
01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:14.940
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want to do a 45 minute set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I take Joey on the road with me,</v>

2660
01:52:14.941 --> 01:52:19.941
<v Speaker 5>it's like I'm taking another headliner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's a fucking headline or any </v>

2661
01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:22.680

<v Speaker 5>It's really weird.</v>

2749
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 5>Then you look at little babies.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And when when she gets food like it </v>

2752
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter like she can eat like </v>
<v Speaker 5>solid food,</v>

2753
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 5>but you've got to watch her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be careful.</v>

2754
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to make sure that she can't </v>

2755
01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 5>get anything she could choke on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:21.141
<v Speaker 5>of the things she likes to do is get </v>
<v Speaker 5>bones,</v>

2758
01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:24.150
<v Speaker 5>so I still like put bones in her mouth </v>
<v Speaker 5>and lick the bones and it's like a big,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this bone with meat on it.</v>

2765

<v Speaker 5>raised being high.</v>

2836
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:18.910

01:59:21.991 --> 01:59:26.991
<v Speaker 5>That dog was like three or four years </v>
<v Speaker 5>old before I got her nose and she was </v>

2840
01:59:26.991 --> 01:59:30.481
<v Speaker 5>living on the street in la,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating out of garbage cans and they </v>

2841
01:59:30.481 --> 01:59:31.630
<v Speaker 5>caught her and she had to change her </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies covered in mange when I first got</v>

2842
01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.940
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I had to treat her with chemicals,</v>

2843
01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:39.450
<v Speaker 5>had it with some sort of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a washer and I ended up like just </v>

2844
01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:40.260
<v Speaker 5>feed her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She ate like insane amounts of foods.</v>

2845
01:59:40.261 --> 01:59:41.740
<v Speaker 5>You could not eat enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was.</v>

2846
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 5>She was a voracious appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So voracious.</v>

2847
01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.750
<v Speaker 5>She was sneaking out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2848
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Even though I fed her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a fat pig.</v>

2849
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:50.370
<v Speaker 5>She was sneaking out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She would call.</v>

2850
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:53.740
<v Speaker 5>She had a hole that she found wish you'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>go under the fence.</v>

2851
01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.260
<v Speaker 5>So you go to the neighbor's house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tip over the garbage,</v>

2852
01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 5>eat their garbage and then sneak back in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the yard.</v>

2853
01:59:58.601 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 5>And I had no idea she was doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she was doing it forever.</v>

2854
02:00:00.761 --> 02:00:01.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this dog's fat as fuck.</v>

2855
02:00:01.871 --> 02:00:04.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm giving her diet dog food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's fatter,</v>

2856
02:00:04.061 --> 02:00:05.320
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is happening?</v>

2857
02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:06.120
<v Speaker 5>She just kept</v>

2858
02:00:07.110 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 2>clever duck.</v>

2859
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:12.870
<v Speaker 5>Well they have this thing where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like they're never going to have </v>

2860
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.870
<v Speaker 5>enough food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2861
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.970
<v Speaker 5>they can't stop eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>

2862
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 5>they will keep eating until they get </v>
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>

2863
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:20.010
<v Speaker 5>Like she got into a bag once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had like a bag of dog food and just </v>

2864
02:00:20.010 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 5>ate so much that like her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her whole body was hard.</v>

2865
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:25.750
<v Speaker 5>Like it was the weirdest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like her stomach was hard.</v>

2866
02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 5>I was worried about her and she threw up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then she would eat the throw up.</v>

2867
02:00:28.631 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like she couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was never satisfied.</v>

2868
02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the same kind of thing </v>

2869
02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:36.990
<v Speaker 2>is happening when you leave and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back,</v>

2870
02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>like you walk in literally they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy that you came here because they </v>

2871
02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2872
02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating like,</v>

2873
02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2874
02:00:42.601 --> 02:00:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow may not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just left.</v>

2875
02:00:44.641 --> 02:00:46.320
<v Speaker 2>He's probably not coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

2876
02:00:46.321 --> 02:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm alone again.</v>

2877
02:00:47.551 --> 02:00:50.820
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck you came back,</v>

2878
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2879
02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:53.730
<v Speaker 5>what do you think about some dogs where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've done tests,</v>

2880
02:00:53.731 --> 02:00:58.731
<v Speaker 5>where they show that when owners are </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming home that the dogs respond even </v>

2881
02:00:58.731 --> 02:01:00.030
<v Speaker 5>when they're coming home and not normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>

2882
02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:05.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unusual hours that through hidden </v>

2883
02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:05.060
<v Speaker 5>cameras they found that dogs can </v>
<v Speaker 5>anticipate when their,</v>

2884
02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:06.300
<v Speaker 5>when their masters are coming home.</v>

2885
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving in their car on the way over </v>

2886
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like a lot of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>

2888
02:01:13.371 --> 02:01:15.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's enough that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go,</v>

2889
02:01:15.231 --> 02:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>well what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

2890
02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:22.420
<v Speaker 2>How they smelling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>copies to let be sleeping on the couch </v>

2891
02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>and then like immediately wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just sit by the door in like 10 </v>

2892
02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>minutes later my girlfriend would walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the door.</v>

2893
02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:28.670
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2894
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:32.030
<v Speaker 2>it was always so weird and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was just that the time,</v>

2895
02:01:32.031 --> 02:01:34.370
<v Speaker 2>because the time was always kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the same time.</v>

2896
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:39.010
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a fucking watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous dog like looks around.</v>

2897
02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2898
02:01:39.621 --> 02:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>When it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the delight,</v>

2899
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>the big rock that is bright outside goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and then he starts playing with </v>

2900
02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>that machine over there that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

2901
02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>that kind of proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means like in,</v>

2902
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figures out its own way.</v>

2903
02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.330
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2904
02:01:54.331 --> 02:01:59.331
<v Speaker 5>because with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they showed was hidden camera </v>

2905
02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:02.511
<v Speaker 5>footage when they had the dog would like</v>
<v Speaker 5>respond and we'd get up and start </v>

2906
02:02:02.511 --> 02:02:03.870
<v Speaker 5>walking around like as the owner was </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming home.</v>
