00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.021
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

3
00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing with the idea of dark spiritual forces at work behind human history,</v>

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>manipulating Moctezuma,</v>

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>manipulating Cortez and plunging mankind into the sea of,</v>

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>of cruelty and misery.</v>

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.031
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

9
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>what redeems the story for me and does it at all times,</v>

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>is that the human spirit's still shines through.</v>

11
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Even in the darkest times.</v>

12
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>There is courage,</v>

13
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>there is decency,</v>

14
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>there is love people.</v>

15
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>People struggle to show the best in themselves and,</v>

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

17
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

18
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and to deliver the best in themselves.</v>

19
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>So I've tried to show both sides of this.</v>

20
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>This book is about the battle of good against evil.</v>

21
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that the Spanish are good and the Aztecs are evil because the</v>

22
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Spanish were wicked,</v>

23
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:41.731
<v Speaker 1>wicked,</v>

24
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>wicked as well.</v>

25
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>and they did terrible things.</v>

27
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>They fed people to dogs.</v>

28
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.041
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

30
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:47.411
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

31
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>they burned people at the state.</v>

32
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>What is actually burning somebody at the stake,</v>

33
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>if not a form of human sacrifice.</v>

34
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Spanish were due to.</v>

35
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 1>Their God.</v>

36
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>They were sacrificing people to,</v>

37
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>their gods are no different from the Aztec.</v>

38
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So in that respect,</v>

39
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>the level of sacrifice was so insane that I,</v>

40
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I tried to explain it to a friend of mine and he literally told me I was</v>

41
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting when I told them that 80,000 people were sacrificed.</v>

42
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Thousand were sacrificed period of like,</v>

43
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.571
<v Speaker 1>like four days,</v>

44
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>four days,</v>

45
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>with teams of killers,</v>

47
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>50 teams of killers working at the top of the great pyramid to process people</v>

48
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>within a minute or two.</v>

49
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.921
<v Speaker 1>processed them.</v>

51
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>The think of it,</v>

52
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.251
<v Speaker 1>that's how it's done.</v>

53
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It was done on an industrial scale.</v>

54
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Cues of victims stretching a mile in every direction,</v>

55
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>marching up the pyramid and having there and having their hearts cut out.</v>

57
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And all of this in honor of a,</v>

58
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>of a demonic,</v>

59
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>demonic entity,</v>

61
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>which the Aztecs passionately believed in.</v>

62
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>They believed that he needed to be fed human hearts and blood.</v>

63
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.043
<v Speaker 1>And when they call,</v>

64
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>they called him Witsell a poshly,</v>

65
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>which means hummingbird at the left hand of the son.</v>

66
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>He's the war God after whom,</v>

67
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>this after whom this novel is a,</v>

68
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:52.041
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

69
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

70
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.153
<v Speaker 1>is named.</v>

71
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.451
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

73
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

74
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.171
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

75
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at it,</v>

76
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>the same demonic entities manipulating both Moctezuma and Cortez,</v>

77
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>he appears to Cortez in dreams and takes on the disguise of Saint Peter.</v>

78
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>He appears to Moctezuma as the,</v>

79
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>as the war God,</v>

80
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same demon that's playing with men.</v>

81
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's one reason why I wrote this is a novel because you can't get into</v>

82
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>this stuff in a nonfiction book,</v>

83
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.911
<v Speaker 1>but it's very real.</v>

84
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a very real part of human history and the whole shape of the world we live</v>

85
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:19.614
<v Speaker 1>in today.</v>

86
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

87
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>the terrible genocide that happened in North America,</v>

88
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>the destruction of the North American Indians,</v>

89
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

90
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the conquest of Peru,</v>

91
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>the whole relationship of the European powers to,</v>

92
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>to Africa,</v>

93
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:30.901
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

94
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>All of this was based on what happened in those years between 15,</v>

95
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>19 and 15,</v>

96
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>21 when the Spanish conquest of Mexico and folded.</v>

97
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.561
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

99
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.011
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

100
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I think we would lead on to a dark track.</v>

102
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how it could have been if those two cultures,</v>

103
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>if the Spanish and the Aztecs had met one another in a spirit of mutual</v>

104
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>

105
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>how much there was to exchange,</v>

106
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>how much each side of the Atlantic could have learned from the other.</v>

107
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Instead of three,</v>

108
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>it becomes this kind of conflagration of,</v>

109
00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

111
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.913
<v Speaker 1>of blood.</v>

112
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's difficult to place ourselves in the mindset of the people of that time.</v>

113
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>It is difficult for us to do that today.</v>

114
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>and I have to say,</v>

116
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the Spaniards,</v>

117
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean 490 men turn up on the coast of Mexico in 11 ships and they are going to</v>

118
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>take on this empire that can put 200,000 men into the field that will,</v>

119
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>if they catch you,</v>

120
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>will match you up the pyramid and cut your heart out.</v>

121
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And many Spaniards were sacrificed,</v>

122
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>in sight of their,</v>

124
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>of their colleagues.</v>

125
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it was an extraordinary time.</v>

127
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>It was an extraordinary event and men of those times were different from,</v>

128
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.633
<v Speaker 1>from men of today,</v>

129
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.483
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

130
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>What is the main stream explanation for human sacrifice?</v>

131
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

132
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>What do they believe started off?</v>

133
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that it's that it's a feeding of psychic energy to supernatural beings.</v>

135
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what human sacrifices about that,</v>

136
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

137
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>that you take the psychic energy of the individual,</v>

138
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to kill you,</v>

139
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.843
<v Speaker 1>kill them,</v>

140
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>take their psychic energy and feed it to these vampire like creatures that are</v>

141
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>lying in the beyond that,</v>

142
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>that thrive on human misery and pain.</v>

143
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.991
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

144
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>who are we to say that such things do not exist?</v>

145
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand the nature of reality.</v>

146
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at human culture day,</v>

147
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at wars.</v>

148
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Look at wars that are happening in the world today.</v>

149
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Look at the tens of thousands of people that are being slaughtered in a warfare</v>

150
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

151
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>That's also a kind of human sacrifice.</v>

152
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to consider the possibility that some kind of demonic forces</v>

153
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>thriving on this and,</v>

154
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

155
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>and being nourished by it.</v>

156
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that we need to do as human beings is to separate</v>

157
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>ourselves from that and say,</v>

158
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

159
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>we will not do that.</v>

160
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>We will not feed that energy.</v>

161
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>We will not offer lives each of the beyond.</v>

162
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't go with you on that,</v>

163
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>but I do in a way.</v>

164
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in demons,</v>

165
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

166
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's undeniable that there have been massive groups of people that have</v>

167
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>participated in horrific things.</v>

168
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So what is that if not demonic?</v>

169
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's,</v>

170
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's demonic.</v>

171
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove it.</v>

172
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove that that's the case.</v>

173
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think we should stay open to that possibility that the nature of reality</v>

174
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>is so complex and so multilayered that there may be much more going on than we</v>

175
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>think and that if we just,</v>

176
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>if we just confine our explanations of things to purely economic and material</v>

177
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:19.991
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>

178
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.991
<v Speaker 1>we may be missing part of the picture and that when the ancients spoke of angels</v>

179
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>and demons to use words,</v>

180
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that I believe in angels or demons as such,</v>

181
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but when they spoke of Lot and light and dark forces,</v>

182
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive forces playing on the,</v>

183
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:35.411
<v Speaker 1>on the human race,</v>

184
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe they had something going.</v>

185
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there was something to that.</v>

186
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I always consider the fact that human beings have this incredibly broad spectrum</v>

187
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>of possibility,</v>

188
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>incredibly bar,</v>

189
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>broad spectrum of behavior,</v>

190
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>personality of circumstance,</v>

191
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.944
<v Speaker 1>of genetics,</v>

192
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and that there's this Yin and Yang of life.</v>

193
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:55.501
<v Speaker 1>There's this pull and push of life and that the extreme ends of it are good and</v>

194
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

195
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.441
<v Speaker 1>Good and evil.</v>

196
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And it may,</v>

198
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it may not be a demon,</v>

199
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but it might as well be a demon if you're marching 80,000 people off the side of</v>

200
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>a pyramid and cutting their heart out with a fucking stone tool.</v>

201
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>That's demonic.</v>

203
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.363
<v Speaker 1>It might as well be,</v>

204
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>might as well be a demon.</v>

205
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.161
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

207
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:09.421
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

208
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and that is a,</v>

209
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>that is worth considering.</v>

210
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

211
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>and the question is what is,</v>

212
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>

214
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:19.121
<v Speaker 1>I have a very dear friend called James Tiburon who refers to this world that we</v>

215
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>live in as a university of [inaudible] that we have,</v>

216
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.310
<v Speaker 1>that we have lessons to learn from oddity,</v>

217
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe dualities,</v>

218
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>not the whole thing.</v>

219
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is an overarching unity and oneness in,</v>

220
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:32.511
<v Speaker 1>in all things.</v>

221
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>But right now here in this incarnation on planet earth,</v>

222
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>we have to learn from duality.</v>

223
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about duality is human beings can choose.</v>

224
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>We can always choose,</v>

225
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>even in the most straightened and difficult circumstances,</v>

226
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>we can always choose for the light rather than the darkness.</v>

227
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>We can always choose for good rather than evil.</v>

228
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to take that act that causes pain and suffering to another human</v>

229
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

230
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>We never have to do that.</v>

231
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>We can always choose not to.</v>

232
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>The alarming thing is that people often will choose the act that causes pain and</v>

233
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>suffering to others,</v>

234
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>and we are defined by our choices.</v>

235
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And this is where we need to grow up as a species and start to choose,</v>

236
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>start to choose the light.</v>

237
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
