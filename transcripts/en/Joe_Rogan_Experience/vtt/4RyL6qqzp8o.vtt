<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

3
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope smoking cigarettes.</v>

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I was just a swore that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to smoke outside this </v>

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time I stuck this place up so </v>

7
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't bad at all.</v>

8
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Yellowed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

9
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you kept saying,</v>

10
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:22.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get this whole system now it's </v>

11
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>slipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely dissipating.</v>

12
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I see the smoke sucked away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember at the end last time.</v>

13
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work as good as I thought it</v>

14
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gonna you really reached this place up.</v>

15
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>you're always getting cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you get that sugar free.</v>

18
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Sugar free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't be good for you.</v>

20
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Well I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to put a splash of whiskey</v>

21
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:52.521
<v Speaker 1>in it just to hopefully kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspartame taste fucking by the way I,</v>

22
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said occasionally say this on stage </v>

23
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>even when there's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm just angry about it,</v>

24
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Stevia is an artificial sweetener and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big scam where you,</v>

25
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>there's no artificial sweeteners because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hate getting that fucking aspartame </v>

26
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>

27
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

28
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>But then they have Stevia in it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's natural and it still tastes like </v>

29
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're thinking,</v>

30
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no artificial sweeteners.</v>

31
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>That means it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

32
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it still tastes like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

33
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it's natural shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had a soda?</v>

34
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm assuming it's Steve.</v>

35
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>You nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out.</v>

36
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

37
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not Dr.</v>

38
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>perhaps skeptical you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been burned before.</v>

39
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not coca cola,</v>

40
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes lighter.</v>

41
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

42
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have any here doing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

43
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>We should get some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

44
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the Stevia ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

45
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

46
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>There's different Stevia to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff's TV Steve.</v>

47
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I just generally don't drink things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sugar or need sugar.</v>

48
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I unsweetened iced tea is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

49
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>or if it's just juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with vodka I put,</v>

50
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I use vodka soda with just a tiny splash</v>
<v Speaker 1>of either grapefruit or so.</v>

51
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no sugar in it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink fucking Coca Cola.</v>

52
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll put a splash in a whiskey but tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if I get fucking hammered on </v>

53
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably drank,</v>

54
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four ounces of coke.</v>

55
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's health benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just avoid sugar.</v>

56
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucks up your whiskey here.</v>

57
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>How's things in Brisbane or you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayor yet?</v>

58
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

59
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to find someone to run.</v>

60
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I would be the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

61
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:59.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a cruise ship comedy where you </v>

63
00:02:59.281 --> 00:02:59.281
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

64
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the worst about a cruise ship would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sucked.</v>

65
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to be in the buffet </v>
<v Speaker 1>line with everyone who saw you suck in </v>

66
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the whole week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're around people who saw you suck.</v>

67
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>That would be the mayor of bisbee where </v>
<v Speaker 1>half the town hates you for because </v>

68
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not supporting whatever stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

69
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And you have to see them at Safeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your town have a split?</v>

70
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Is there like a conservative side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your town and the Liberals?</v>

71
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not usually a,</v>

72
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your usual dynamic of conservative and </v>

73
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

74
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>we hate queers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a of the plastic bag ban.</v>

75
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell us we can't have plastic </v>

76
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're bad for the environment.</v>

77
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Will ask here because I'm used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a plastic bag and yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you have to scrub a fucking casserole</v>

106
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>pan and then try to remember who brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so you can get it back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they went through fucking gorgeous.</v>

130
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>This is only 400 grand or you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for less.</v>

131
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a for 99.</v>

132
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

133
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Dad was saying you could probably get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three slash 75.</v>

134
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is it's county and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

135
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's got the except Dick and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the worst homeowner ever.</v>

136
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you started putting that like septic</v>

137
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:54.161
<v Speaker 1>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a septic and one of my old houses </v>

138
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:54.161
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

139
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pump broke and then a first the </v>

140
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.791
<v Speaker 1>toilet bowl started back up and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tub started filling up with piss and </v>

141
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Times.</v>

142
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom downstairs in the tub </v>

143
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 1>starts filling up with like what in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going on and what it was.</v>

144
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 1>This Colorado knows when I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hills there was a,</v>

145
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>had a house in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a septic tank,</v>

146
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:24.911
<v Speaker 1>was slightly above the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see had a pump to get to the septic </v>

147
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:28.511
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would pump the waste into the </v>

148
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:28.511
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>

149
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Like ideally they always want the tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be below,</v>

150
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:34.841
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a natural flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pump broke so the tanks are </v>

151
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>backing up into the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Times.</v>

152
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

153
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the things that I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

154
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

155
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had the money,</v>

156
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I would just buy that as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

157
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>This is our studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't look.</v>

158
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Their guests can stay here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll make this into a like a place like</v>

159
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a great idea.</v>

160
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>It would be a fucking airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

161
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>can you fly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

162
00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>but I have learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a pilot.</v>

163
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better.</v>

164
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Better than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually has a real gig now.</v>

165
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would come down,</v>

166
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>he was a fan and he would fly into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisbee from Tucson just to get his hours</v>

167
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 1>because to get his commercial license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

168
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>he came to a not a super bowl party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

169
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last special I taped,</v>

170
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>he came down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flew down with a bunch of his friends.</v>

171
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.000
<v Speaker 1>We taped it in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be my last special and uh,</v>

172
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 1>so the next morning he flew back over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and he had put Stan and hope </v>

173
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>under each wing and he buzzed our house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>

174
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a commercial,</v>

175
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>a guy for Sky West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Delta partner.</v>

176
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And he actually picked me up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport when I flew.</v>

177
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I flew back from Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was learning how to fly and now </v>

178
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he's a professional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how,</v>

179
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to build up our.</v>

180
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So we'd these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.850
<v Speaker 1>stone yet before you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to fly a jumbo jet </v>

182
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>questionnaires from a lot of questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than,</v>

183
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you fly me to la?</v>

184
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Like if I needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk about under </v>

185
00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:11.920
<v Speaker 1>appreciated people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that know how to pilot the </v>

186
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>planes 1500 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

187
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And they make Dick for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never read those stories were like in </v>

188
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.541
<v Speaker 1>New York where they have these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>single rooms with like eight bunk beds,</v>

189
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>pilots living in there when they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay over because you can't afford what </v>

190
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:36.680
<v Speaker 1>does this Jamie for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 200 and $1,500</v>

191
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>for hours on the 2:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>for commercial sites.</v>

192
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that's non transporting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 250 hours of flight time.</v>

193
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.890
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember what?</v>

194
00:09:47.891 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>How bad he drived when you're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad did you drive when you were 20?</v>

195
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

196
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember driving piece of Shit cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no worries.</v>

197
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Like now just to go to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go,</v>

198
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:07.651
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to make a on this car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought A.</v>

199
00:10:08.111 --> 00:10:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I used to buy a lot of shitty cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered newspapers in,</v>

200
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.200
<v Speaker 1>so I'd buy a car for like 300 bucks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just beat it into the ground and get rid</v>

201
00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:17.410
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do that when I lived on the road</v>

202
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:22.411
<v Speaker 1>and doing like tripled gigs where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to drive 11 hours from </v>

203
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Arizona to southern Wyoming and hope the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car makes and you can see the ground </v>

204
00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 1>through the passenger side floor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rusted out.</v>

205
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:39.100
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see pavement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me drive those cars,</v>

206
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever until they died and then </v>

207
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.200
<v Speaker 1>hitchhiked to the next town and hope you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

208
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.080
<v Speaker 1>a comic there that can get you to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city for the Gig.</v>

209
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Could you have ever imagined when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were 21 or however old you were when you</v>

210
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 1>first started doing the road?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't.</v>

211
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>He would look back on those horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights with likeness stalled.</v>

212
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it then.</v>

213
00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was nostalgic then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

214
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I was shamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

215
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

216
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

217
00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't enjoying it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably a big </v>

219
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.121
<v Speaker 1>difference between doing it on the East </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coast and Boston and congestion rather </v>

220
00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 1>than the great wide open of Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>

221
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's a part of the shows are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably bleaker though.</v>

222
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Like we had shows like you would do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of road gigs,</v>

223
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:36.091
<v Speaker 1>but they were good gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they weren't like the boom of the </v>

224
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 1>late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started in 88 and I started doing gigs</v>

225
00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 1>on the road hell gigs on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like 89.</v>

226
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of gigs back then that </v>

227
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 1>were really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go somewhere,</v>

228
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.710
<v Speaker 1>there'll be 300 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a great crowd,</v>

229
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>150 people in a bar there.</v>

230
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>They love comedy night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of them were really good,</v>

231
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the never knowing if you're going to </v>

232

<v Speaker 1>the stress of being poor.</v>

233
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a lot of bills living on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my car.</v>

234
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of downtime at a lot of,</v>

235

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you get a view of the country that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really stop and think about it,</v>

242
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.380
<v Speaker 1>like how many different places you've </v>

<v Speaker 1>This is how they rock it over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

247
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>This is how they do it in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how they are.</v>

248
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>New Orleans is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

249
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you put it all together.</v>

250
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 1>You get America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just like a dude who just </v>

251
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>like parks it in Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and fucking that's that.</v>

252
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And all you know is CNN and tmz go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is what the country's coming lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking lubes with fucking do </v>

254
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.550
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out amongst people,</v>

256
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 1>no one really gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one gives a fuck.</v>

257
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It's barred chatter at best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

258
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 1>You've never run into people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually affected.</v>

259
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't unless you're looking for it.</v>

260
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

261
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it's a nonissue what?</v>

262
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most pressing issue because it's.</v>

263
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It can shift the country one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

264
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what's weird about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one gives a fuck about the things </v>

265
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.921
<v Speaker 1>that actually affect them locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that sets that guy off to </v>

266
00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:48.121
<v Speaker 1>bitch about trump or bitch about hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he forgot to move his car on street </v>

267
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>sweeping day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he never goes down to petition.</v>

268
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>City Council about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

269
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stop sign was obscured,</v>

270
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Speaker 1>your honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

271
00:13:56.901 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have run the stop sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a fucking branch in front of</v>

272
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:05.371
<v Speaker 1>it and you need to cut that down and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a ticket and I can't afford the </v>

273
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.821
<v Speaker 1>ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the economy fucking trump or </v>

274
00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just bring it to the highest level.</v>

275
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've realized by </v>

276
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 1>talking to people that really understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how things work,</v>

277
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>like economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like talk to Peter Schiff yesterday,</v>

278
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had them on my podcast.</v>

279
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

280
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

281
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like you.</v>

282
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.980
<v Speaker 1>You could talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never drunk and busy.</v>

283
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 1>He would get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

285
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really smart guy.</v>

286
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very successful guy,</v>

287
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but he's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right there.</v>

288
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Like when you talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I first time we did a show,</v>

289
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 1>we've got drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided to have a couple of drinks </v>

290
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 1>and lighten up because he was doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Fox News,</v>

291
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>CNN thing they do where they have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute panels.</v>

292
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>We just have to rattle off statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to tell the people.</v>

293
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 1>The problem was economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it like he's a wizard.</v>

294
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to calm them</v>

295
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.510
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My two,</v>

296
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 2>we're here for a long time and so let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a drink.</v>

297
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little Jack Daniels.</v>

298
00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Then they loosened up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he set up a video that said,</v>

299
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one percent asked me,</v>

300
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 2>asked me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you said?</v>

301
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

302
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.190
<v Speaker 2>So went to occupy Wall Street and set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a finger just talking to people about </v>

303
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

304
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Nora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why you think it works.</v>

305
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 2>This is how it really works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I realized.</v>

306
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:21.851
<v Speaker 2>Talking to people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking way you could be on </v>

307
00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:25.121
<v Speaker 2>the ball with all this stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress and the Senate and all the </v>

308
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 2>stuff that goes on behind the scenes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists.</v>

309
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 2>He would have to be fully immersed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

310
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.360
<v Speaker 2>You would have to be fully immersed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and then fully immersed in the stock </v>

311
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.271
<v Speaker 2>market to have any kind of an argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or another and most people are </v>

312
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:41.801
<v Speaker 2>just having these halfassed half cocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty thought out arguments about </v>

313
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>almost everything they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including me,</v>

314
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.840
<v Speaker 2>including especially on this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

315
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is something that we.</v>

316
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It's standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too much shit to.</v>

317
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too much fucking.</v>

318
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you pretend to understand politics,</v>

319
00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:05.271
<v Speaker 2>like how long have been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unravel this Russia thing again tuned </v>

320
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 2>out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

321
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know and I don't care enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to learn.</v>

322
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I get to a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through a period of,</v>

323
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bag bagging,</v>

324
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 2>our conspiracy theory days and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned a little bit,</v>

325
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:24.791
<v Speaker 2>but anything that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know how government </v>

326
00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to know.</v>

327
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.790
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just elementary school fucking,</v>

328
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

329
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't even know what that </v>

331
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.561
<v Speaker 2>fucking men stopped talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably paying attention to it more </v>

332
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 2>than most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people just for a minute.</v>

333
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president or anybody just represents</v>

334
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 2>what they like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I like a nice guy.</v>

335
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a no bullshit guy.</v>

336
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just find whoever's best </v>

337
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 2>fits that mold and you supply the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president who is the most popular.</v>

338
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating though.</v>

339
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

340
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I think if a trump was any</v>

341
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.750
<v Speaker 3>republican that wasn't a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole,</v>

342
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:16.570
<v Speaker 3>but stood for the same principles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no outrage.</v>

343
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.190
<v Speaker 3>They hate his personality first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm not against you.</v>

344
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

345
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:25.030
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's the one you created.</v>

346
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.490
<v Speaker 3>We were just talking about,</v>

<v Speaker 3>asshole and he knows,</v>

352
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.120
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I keep being a fucking,</v>

353
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.330

<v Speaker 1>And Ann Coulter who just says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People say outrageous things just to get</v>

356
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:03.070
<v Speaker 1>attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>tenants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feed the trolls and then all of a </v>

358
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.110
<v Speaker 1>sudden you elect a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something outrageous again,</v>

361
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.790

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

362
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you before the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted nugent is a nice guy.</v>

363
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

364

<v Speaker 1>Do you remember trolling his message </v>
<v Speaker 1>board from your message for you trolled </v>

365
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.581
<v Speaker 1>his message board and you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were giving instructions on how </v>

366
00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>other people should trolls message </v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

367
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

368
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>They were so like they were Magda before</v>
<v Speaker 1>MCA was mega,</v>

369
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
<v Speaker 1>like they were make America great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit about it in my act about not</v>

370
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:47.540
<v Speaker 1>needing the draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just show up at Ted nugent concert at</v>

371
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 1>scoop him up in nets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something along the way that </v>

372
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take away nascar</v>

373
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.950
<v Speaker 3>and I forgot that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was even have a message board are</v>

374
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.970
<v Speaker 3>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they even exist because your message </v>

375
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.401
<v Speaker 3>board would troll and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got on board with the trolling Ted </v>

376
00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>nugent's message board and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>passive aggressively.</v>

377
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:17.321
<v Speaker 3>I would backhand insult him by going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

378
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.140
<v Speaker 3>we got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a band together and get the news </v>

379
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Speaker 3>back on the airways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no fair.</v>

380
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Speaker 3>All these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

381
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:29.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rage against the machine wannabes are </v>

382
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.870
<v Speaker 3>getting all the airplay and when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the request,</v>

383
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Speaker 3>true rock and roll legend like Ted </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nugent,</v>

384
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:40.151
<v Speaker 3>they laughed me off the phone and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no fair that all these guys are selling </v>

385
00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:44.801
<v Speaker 3>out arenas and Ted nugent is stuck at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some state fair play beside it.</v>

386
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Tilt a whirlwind and Andy Gump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a handful of people.</v>

387
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.680
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pro routing people to get nugent </v>

388
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.440
<v Speaker 3>more notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time he's playing 35 </v>

389
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 3>people at the fucking Arkansas state </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair.</v>

390
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

391
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 3>And he dancer you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

392
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.650
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played a lot more than people.</v>

393
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 3>That was the early days of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An understanding message boards.</v>

394
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I understand how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

395
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad he never brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

396
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:34.101
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been able to defend it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

397
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's Doug.</v>

398
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my friend.</v>

399
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

400
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

401
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

402
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.730
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about before is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are nice people.</v>

403
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is</v>

404
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 2>their act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their act is say outrageous things.</v>

405
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Get people to pay attention to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then that it becomes such a lousy trick </v>

406
00:20:56.621 --> 00:21:01.621
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just feel like it's so fucking </v>

407
00:21:01.621 --> 00:21:01.621
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

408
00:21:01.621 --> 00:21:06.271
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they believed that and they </v>

409
00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 2>also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe Ted believes most of what he's</v>

410
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:14.551
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you also says things in an </v>

411
00:21:14.551 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 2>outrageous manner because that's part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his showbiz style.</v>

412
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Like he's the motor city madman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

413
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

414
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:24.270
<v Speaker 2>he's a wild motherfucker is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you like it is and he believes a </v>

415
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 2>lot of what he says and he makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>about many things.</v>

416
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 2>But then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

417
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Haywire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sti?</v>

418
00:21:29.761 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>But when you're with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

419
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a nice guy.</v>

420
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a genuinely nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It as much as he says crazy shit.</v>

421
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 2>he believes he supporting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent side of the message that you</v>

423
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 2>should be able to have guns if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible law abiding person.</v>

424
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 2>And part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

425
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

426
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the problem is just like we were </v>

427
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 2>talking about people running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

428
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't really get the nuance stance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of who a person is from these campaign </v>

429
00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 2>ads or debates or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get.</v>

430
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.920
<v Speaker 2>You get this image is flash thing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got to know almost everybody's </v>

431
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:10.170
<v Speaker 2>alright if you get to know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say he has no reason to have his </v>

432
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:15.841
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he has to be a dick just to keep </v>

433
00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:19.561
<v Speaker 2>himself like Kilroy and kind of say </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachel Jones would be like Alex Jones is</v>

434
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:26.731
<v Speaker 2>a guy who may be now he believes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than he should have bought his own </v>

435
00:22:26.731 --> 00:22:26.731
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

436
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 2>But he created that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what he.</v>

437
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 2>He created his own art form and made </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

438
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Ted nugent is a guy who had two shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>songs in 1977 stranglehold is like I am </v>

439
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.830
<v Speaker 2>desperate to stay in the spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a Kathy Griffin,</v>

440
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 2>like clawing who look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please notice me.</v>

441
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm still relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

442
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 2>But they go to them for opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

443
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why,</v>

444
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 2>like anytime there's a gun control </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

445
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.600
<v Speaker 2>they go to Ted nugent was going to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outrageous thing.</v>

446
00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 2>His Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's good at it,</v>

447
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:01.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

448
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to write them off like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is like when he debates </v>

449
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.381
<v Speaker 2>people about gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows to actual statistics and the </v>

450
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:14.221
<v Speaker 2>actual statistics are confusing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that this had a gun </v>

451
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:18.151
<v Speaker 2>violence deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant chunk of them are suicide and </v>

452
00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>then there's gang violence as the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones and then it gets down to actual gun</v>

453
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 2>violence and then the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

454
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:23.310
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

455
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.410
<v Speaker 2>they're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not what you would want them to </v>

456
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:28.410
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want it to be cut and dry.</v>

457
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.221
<v Speaker 2>Like people are using guns and crimes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>passion and school shootings and that's </v>

458
00:23:32.221 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 2>why there's guns need to take them off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the table.</v>

459
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:38.221
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what we attributed deaths are </v>

460
00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:38.230
<v Speaker 2>suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking dark.</v>

461
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 2>How many people pull the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of gun violence is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's.</v>

463
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how crazy Chicago</v>

464
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the number again?</v>

465
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 4>1,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

466
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because I had another stat </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I was waiting to pull up that day </v>

467
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 5>that was crazier to me in debt and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>from like 1970,</v>

468
00:23:55.671 --> 00:24:00.671
<v Speaker 5>roughly about 89.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The murders in New York City was almost </v>

469
00:24:00.671 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 5>triple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is like 2,245</v>

470
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 5>was the highest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

471
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 5>In the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York was crazy.</v>

472
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like average or eight.</v>

473
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 5>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>900 I think in Chicago is what it is.</v>

474
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 5>But there was one year that was 1500 in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a year,</v>

475
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

476
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

477
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 5>There's one particularly high</v>

478
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way more than dying in Afghanistan,</v>

479
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 4>way more than dying in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

480
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 4>it's in Chicago and this is like if for </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason it's,</v>

481
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:24.580
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

482
00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:26.700
<v Speaker 4>it barely gets our attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

483
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 4>guys like him are important for getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>that message out.</v>

484
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 4>Even if he does it in this fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

485
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 4>like how we need to look at like what </v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing is like.</v>

486
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 4>We definitely have a gun problem in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

487
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.330
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

488
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't think either side is right about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

489
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a fucking human problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that humans are just running </v>

490
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.801
<v Speaker 4>around shooting people is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the fact that we're smart </v>

491
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:50.801
<v Speaker 4>enough to figure out guns.</v>

492
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time a me and Chad shank get drunk</v>

493
00:24:54.691 --> 00:24:57.330
<v Speaker 3>and have one of these conversations late</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the night,</v>

494
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.380
<v Speaker 3>it always boils down to overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people.</v>

495
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow we can always boil it down to </v>

496
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's too many fucking people.</v>

497
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Well for sure</v>

498
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.590
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't value people when the numbers </v>

499
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.590
<v Speaker 4>are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to,</v>

500
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.750
<v Speaker 4>you value your close knit group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>

501
00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:21.751
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the romantic thing when there's </v>

502
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:22.660
<v Speaker 4>20 million people and you can't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere like La.</v>

503
00:25:22.661 --> 00:25:23.980
<v Speaker 4>You don't value people's.</v>

504
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did a bit of bug that you love.</v>

505
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 3>You love a kitten and if you get a pet </v>
<v Speaker 3>kitten and he would come home every </v>

506
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.360
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Mr Ben goes,</v>

507
00:25:33.361 --> 00:25:38.361
<v Speaker 3>you make me so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you came back to that same </v>

508
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:38.361
<v Speaker 3>bachelor apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

509
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:42.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 square feet and there were 800 </v>

510
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.590
<v Speaker 3>kittens in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't kill kittens quick enough.</v>

511
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get this,</v>

512
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 3>get my golf shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomping kittens,</v>

513
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.060
<v Speaker 3>these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are the same.</v>

514
00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:53.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just like currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

515
00:25:53.581 --> 00:25:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why what you've done as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise move by moving to a town of 5,000,</v>

516
00:25:57.811 --> 00:25:59.170
<v Speaker 3>that's very managed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to love it.</v>

517
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I know one my neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

518
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a very manageable to like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've chosen to do is.</v>

519
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.610
<v Speaker 3>It's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think big cities are manageable.</v>

520
00:26:08.611 --> 00:26:13.611
<v Speaker 3>I think people just put their blinders </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and they just get weird to just get </v>

521
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:13.611
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

522
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:14.930
<v Speaker 4>And some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I get energy from the city.</v>

523
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get that.</v>

524
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.960
<v Speaker 4>You go to New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get it.</v>

525
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:20.310
<v Speaker 4>You walk around as a bug.</v>

526
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 3>So many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's above it.</v>

527
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's dreadful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

528
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.090
<v Speaker 3>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

529
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I get a buzz of anger and murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me that much,</v>

530
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>but it does overwhelm me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

531
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm very claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more I age,</v>

532
00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:37.070
<v Speaker 3>the more things like it just gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

533
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.590
<v Speaker 3>it's also such a direct contrast to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you live,</v>

534
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

535
00:26:42.061 --> 00:26:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>

536
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

537
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I just going out to smoke a cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't,</v>

538
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid you're going to burn </v>

539
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>someone because you've sublet your </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal space and walking that close to</v>

540
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:59.211
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to get in a door jamb just so </v>

541
00:26:59.211 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't burn the fucking pedestrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your cigarette.</v>

542
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no way out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way a thin in that out </v>

543
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.721
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they make it so outrageously </v>

544
00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 2>expensive that literally people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are trying.</v>

545
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the crazy thing is so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to be there and there's so </v>

546
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.351
<v Speaker 2>many people there that they could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep jacking the rents up and jacking </v>

547
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the real estate payments up.</v>

548
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.410
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying about Ted nugent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying about,</v>

549
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:30.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Lucas and a lot of these other </v>

550
00:27:30.411 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 2>people and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

551
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to write somebody off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

552
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.530
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to write people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do less of that because </v>

553
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:43.701
<v Speaker 2>like I'm trying to get to a point like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you let someone when you like </v>

554
00:27:43.701 --> 00:27:48.280
<v Speaker 2>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you decide on recently though </v>

555
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 2>was someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

556
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:53.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like him anymore because he now </v>

557
00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:56.470
<v Speaker 2>has so and so on his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you had someone that just some </v>

558
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 2>random person was for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a person like that.</v>

559
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:04.821
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's a hardcore left </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal is someone I know they didn't even </v>

560
00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 2>listen to the fucking show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like Jordan Peterson was at him.</v>

561
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Is he like a fucking Nazi guy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

562
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Got All the writers.</v>

563
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people think he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he probably wasn't him.</v>

564
00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>It was probably someone more </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial like Ben Shapiro or Steven</v>

565
00:28:20.551 --> 00:28:23.520
<v Speaker 2>crowder or one of those guys would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them are Nazis,</v>

566
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jordan Peterson is much more of a </v>

567
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:28.940
<v Speaker 2>centrist than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not right.</v>

568
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's more of a,</v>

569
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it,</v>

570
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a classic liberal,</v>

571
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 2>classic liberal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.380
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the treating people as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual instead of collective into </v>

573
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 2>sort of a group instead of identifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a group of whatever,</v>

574
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.440
<v Speaker 2>no matter what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat people as individuals and he's a </v>

575
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 2>big proponent of personal responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>and treating people as individuals.</v>

576
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.690
<v Speaker 2>And because of that and because of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things he said about they're </v>

577
00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to enforce a pronouns for </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people,</v>

578
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>the ones that they made up like a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

579
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bill that was a human rights</v>

580
00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:06.950
<v Speaker 2>violation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

581
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 2>because they have that human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>council in Canada and it was,</v>

582
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 2>he was arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a slippery slope?</v>

583
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:19.011
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't compel people to use made up </v>

584
00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't just decide that you're gonna make</v>

585
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:24.321
<v Speaker 2>up a bunch of gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they get people to say there's like </v>

586
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.830
<v Speaker 2>78 of them apparently that facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>excepts right?</v>

587
00:29:27.831 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Speaker 2>There's C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>H,</v>

588
00:29:28.831 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I r,</v>
<v Speaker 2>C I r e.</v>

589
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 2>there's just make them up like anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make them up.</v>

590
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 2>What you want this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

591
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

592
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And so because it's controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people said,</v>

593
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're picking on trans people.</v>

594
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:41.200
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

595
00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

596
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fully support your right to be a trans</v>

597
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:49.921
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to use these bloody </v>

598
00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:52.651
<v Speaker 4>made up words is what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he felt like this is a slippery </v>

599
00:29:52.651 --> 00:29:56.671
<v Speaker 4>slope to controlling people's behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it starts like this and they shame </v>

600
00:29:56.671 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 4>you into thinking their way and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a group think part of it involved.</v>

601
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 4>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got so lumped into um,</v>

602
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 4>this all right idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

603
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who hates transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

604
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just like we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like people running for president.</v>

605
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 4>You don't really get to see who the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>person is.</v>

606
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.870
<v Speaker 4>He get to see this surface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

607
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 4>he's the no nonsense guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take them.</v>

608
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's what they do with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go,</v>

609
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who hates transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>

610
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't at all.</v>

611
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.310
<v Speaker 3>If you really wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

612
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.860
<v Speaker 3>you would never know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

613
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:30.180
<v Speaker 3>candidates true intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were a good candidate,</v>

614
00:30:30.181 --> 00:30:33.060
<v Speaker 3>if they were a crafty politician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>

615
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I would go out and say whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

616
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it worked for trump,</v>

617
00:30:37.441 --> 00:30:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it better and I'll say shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

618
00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:44.661
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll just be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to deport everyone holocaust </v>

619
00:30:46.381 --> 00:30:47.730
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they want to hear,</v>

620
00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:50.610
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd go and God just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you do the right thing.</v>

621
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kinda hoping trump would.</v>

622
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I think you could manipulate his ego to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a point where he could get them to do </v>

623
00:30:58.861 --> 00:31:01.200
<v Speaker 3>your bidding just by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

624
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 3>you're getting good numbers by doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

625
00:31:03.301 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left hates this.</v>

626
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.460
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should legalize marijuana and he </v>

627
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.460
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't need logic.</v>

628
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.380
<v Speaker 3>You just need to have his ego fed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd do all the right things.</v>

629
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what he's holding in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>back pocket.</v>

630
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:21.050
<v Speaker 4>The legalized marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as we get closer to the </v>

631
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.861
<v Speaker 4>election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he makes marijuana federally </v>

632
00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:27.171
<v Speaker 4>illegal and I think he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stoners just fucking raise their </v>

633
00:31:27.171 --> 00:31:28.470
<v Speaker 4>arms in the air and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

634
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm going with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you just know how much that'll change</v>

635
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:32.490
<v Speaker 4>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that.</v>

636
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 4>And they still won't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

637
00:31:34.831 --> 00:31:39.831
<v Speaker 4>they still won't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people complained it </v>

638
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:39.831
<v Speaker 4>didn't vote.</v>

639
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:39.831

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

642
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.970

643
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.280

<v Speaker 4>To be very simple.</v>

644
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Should be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fill out your social security card </v>

645
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.120

646
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.120
<v Speaker 4>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do it on your phone</v>

647
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.070
<v Speaker 3>calling an 800 number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like American idol.</v>

648
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

649

<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everything sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's doing well now.</v>

665
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying how your town works</v>

<v Speaker 1>bait to get people were inside arms at </v>

668
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>safely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just just because they can.</v>

669
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in Arizona.</v>

670
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get that kind of redneck element,</v>

671
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:17.021
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a trump versus hillary and </v>

672
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:20.950
<v Speaker 1>obviously in that small town there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>like black lives matter rallies,</v>

673
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but people still go out and protest for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a red,</v>

674
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:30.641
<v Speaker 1>for Ed,</v>

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 1>on think and work in a limited amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

676
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking around midtown </v>

677
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan and bumping into people </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

678
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you got a gun right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's not gonna work.</v>

679
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

680
00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:46.841
<v Speaker 1>if you're a guy was in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just worried about some no wild drug</v>

681
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:50.170
<v Speaker 1>smugglers coming across the border and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting up your city.</v>

682
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You've got to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

683
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right there.</v>

684
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they keep going.</v>

685
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole Carlin bit where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

686
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:02.080
<v Speaker 1>people bitching about their going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a prison in our community and like</v>

687
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 1>if they escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be hanging around.</v>

688
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It's true going then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true because you're only like seven</v>

689
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I did that.</v>

690
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>A huge injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm misquoting Carlin,</v>

691
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the border patrol roads.</v>

<v Speaker 3>assholes gravitate.</v>

733
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Just like child molesters gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.460

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.210
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

744
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get into going down wormholes,</v>

745
00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 3>have bad cops and fucking get here.</v>

746
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:04.330
<v Speaker 4>Border Patrol and I hit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that you.</v>

747
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.280
<v Speaker 4>Are you making a decision to shatter a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person's body?</v>

748
00:37:07.281 --> 00:37:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Probably forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hitting someone that hard with a.</v>

749
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.190
<v Speaker 4>with a truck that guys got probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's probably broken.</v>

750
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's on a dirt road where it's like </v>

751
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 3>he did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other excuse.</v>

752
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it on purpose.</v>

753
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

754
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.930
<v Speaker 3>I have too much hate in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go sometimes I just have to ignore shit </v>

755
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 3>is just wake up in the morning and I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>on newser and I click on fucking cop </v>

756
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:42.351
<v Speaker 3>throws a guide through a plate glass </v>
<v Speaker 3>window kinda shaded beatings and</v>

757
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

758
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I've said this a hundred times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's worth repeating.</v>

759
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think most people are qualified </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be cops.</v>

760
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:57.141
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a really fucking hard job </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think the pressure of it fucks </v>

761
00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.610
<v Speaker 4>people up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they did go into that job will,</v>

762
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 4>if they gravitate towards it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were bullies,</v>

763
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 4>which I'm sure a certain percentage do </v>
<v Speaker 4>sir for.</v>

764
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I think for most of them it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good job and they think they can pull it</v>

765
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met a lot of cops are good guys,</v>

766
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.840
<v Speaker 4>but I think the pressure of that job and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being shot out all the time and worrying</v>

767
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:20.421
<v Speaker 4>every time you pull somebody over you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get shot and everybody's seen those </v>

768
00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:21.960
<v Speaker 4>videos of people pulling people over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pull out a gun and killed a cop.</v>

769
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.590
<v Speaker 4>There's one that's haunting man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guy Pulls over this Vietnam vet and he </v>

770
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 4>starts.</v>

771
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:33.650
<v Speaker 4>He starts screaming for the guy to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the car and the guy pulls out a </v>

772
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 4>rifle and the guy just starts shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>at him and he gets hit and screaming,</v>

773
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:38.030
<v Speaker 4>just almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop it,</v>

774
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 4>stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop it,</v>

775
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:44.310
<v Speaker 4>and the guy just keeps shooting a cop </v>
<v Speaker 4>while all this is happening and the </v>

776
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.080
<v Speaker 4>guy's like screaming for his life on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's just gunning him down.</v>

777
00:38:46.081 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

778
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 4>tell me these cops haven't seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all fucked up and it's.</v>

779
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 4>It becomes almost like a game and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game is I'm trying to score.</v>

780
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:56.960
<v Speaker 4>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're doing a.</v>

781
00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 4>you're playing one on one basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing Jujitsu or something?</v>

782
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:05.191
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to score on somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the score on them as I think you're up </v>

783
00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:05.191
<v Speaker 4>to something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No good.</v>

784
00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spread your legs.</v>

785
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Let me check your body.</v>

786
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 4>What's going on in the car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you got?</v>

787
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 4>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

788
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 4>You're trying and if you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

789
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 4>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Score.</v>

790
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 4>If you don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck swing and a miss,</v>

791
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.100
<v Speaker 4>and so you go looking for things to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong and that person becomes the enemy </v>

792
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 4>just like you push people on a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>football field or on the other team.</v>

793
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.820
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're doing to the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're supposed to be protecting </v>

794
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 4>and serving the they become the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They become the thing that you're trying</v>

795
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:32.851
<v Speaker 4>to score on and it's just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monkey Games start playing around in </v>

796
00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 4>people's heads and I think almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody's qualified for that.</v>

797
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I know of very few like big John </v>
<v Speaker 4>McCarthy,</v>

798
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 4>the UFC referee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a cop.</v>

799
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.180
<v Speaker 4>Fucking greatest guy ever want to meet </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nicest guy ever,</v>

800
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:47.190
<v Speaker 4>but he's also a big giant dude who's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidated by people and he has a good </v>

801
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 4>way of calming people down and relax and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

802
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 4>but he's very sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very normal and he was a cop.</v>

803
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 4>His whole life is caught for many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many years.</v>

804
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fucking impossible job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ben.</v>

805
00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Every day you're dealing with crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day you're dealing with murder.</v>

<v Speaker 4>beating their wives,</v>

807
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with kids that get hit by</v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

808
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with just the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible shit.</v>

809
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.560
<v Speaker 3>And we could boil this down to too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because I live in a town where I </v>

810
00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:18.021
<v Speaker 3>know the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same cop came to to super bowl parties </v>

811
00:40:18.021 --> 00:40:22.730
<v Speaker 3>in consecutive years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The night before when we had a big pre </v>

812
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.550
<v Speaker 3>party on the Saturday night and came for</v>
<v Speaker 3>noise complaints two years in a row,</v>

813
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.910
<v Speaker 3>the first time he walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christine Levine was on stage doing her </v>

814
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:35.671
<v Speaker 3>act and you can hear everything in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood just speaking and when </v>

815
00:40:35.671 --> 00:40:39.270
<v Speaker 3>she's on a microphone doing a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>my after three kids,</v>

816
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:44.690
<v Speaker 3>my pussy looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It swallowed a dog that chewed its way </v>

817
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.921
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know every fucking neighbor is at </v>

818
00:40:49.021 --> 00:40:53.460
<v Speaker 3>least 30 houses that can hear this over </v>
<v Speaker 3>their TV.</v>

819
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.350
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cops came.</v>

820
00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.380
<v Speaker 3>But that cop came twice and then I'd see</v>
<v Speaker 3>them at Safeway and weed friendly and </v>

821
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 3>when Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had our brief,</v>

822
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:08.250

<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting in the fun house and I see a</v>

<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>

825
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.860
<v Speaker 3>And he came in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

826
00:41:13.861 --> 00:41:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

828
00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:21.501
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you going through a tough time </v>

829
00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:21.501
<v Speaker 3>and I just wanted to see if you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

830
00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:23.220

<v Speaker 1>work for food guy by name.</v>

838
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.800

<v Speaker 1>more because you travel so much because </v>

<v Speaker 1>And then this is the also I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rarely go out.</v>

846
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I go to Safeway every day if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I don't need anything,</v>

847

<v Speaker 1>Discount meat.</v>

850
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I love a bargain and the discount meats </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other than that,</v>

851
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go to bars.</v>

852
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I have a bar in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I know,</v>

853
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 1>they come over to my house and we hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

854
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

855
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you've got an interesting setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

856
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I listened to your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

857
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:37.871
<v Speaker 1>this is such a fascinating setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same as the comedy store,</v>

858
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:43.391
<v Speaker 1>which when I come back I love it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a thousand people all in one night </v>

859
00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 1>that I've known you over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't hate anyone.</v>

860
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were you hear all the,</v>

861
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking I hate that fucking cunt.</v>

862
00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:54.870
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she's funny and she's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

863
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And like I would be if I lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was a regular,</v>

864
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 1>like everyone else at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

865
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd have my beefs and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>

866
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Very few beefs there these days that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

867
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.440
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just saying like snipey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backtalk talk shit behind your back </v>

868
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

869
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I get into that again now I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to see everyone.</v>

870
00:43:16.431 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if they suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch their acts anyway,</v>

871
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but that's what business is like and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it that way where I don't go out.</v>

872
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:28.511
<v Speaker 1>I don't get involved in their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>petty squabbles and everyone's </v>

873
00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 1>backstabbing shit cause even when I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for a long time,</v>

874
00:43:32.091 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go out.</v>

875
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

876
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.470
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have to take sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very fucking knew saying about </v>

877
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 1>avoiding conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but honestly the comedy store these days</v>

878
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost conflict free.</v>

879
00:43:46.131 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much weirder than it's ever been</v>

880
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:50.780
<v Speaker 1>there before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this super,</v>

881
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>super supportive community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very different.</v>

882
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say comedy in general.</v>

883
00:43:56.641 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 1>What was La?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

884
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:03.040
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near headline in that place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't give me this.</v>

885
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

886
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's how I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep busy where I go out rarely.</v>

887
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't believe I lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

888
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I just have a house there that I show up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

889
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be funny.</v>

890
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Would it be funny if you only dressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this on the show and then you </v>

891
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show's over.</v>

892
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to get dressed for my golf </v>

893
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:32.681
<v Speaker 1>tee off and an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you put on like a polo shirt </v>

894
00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:32.681
<v Speaker 1>and a fat rolex.</v>

895
00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I only have particular suits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pajamas.</v>

896
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

897
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't have you become ridiculous suit </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

898
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Like what year did you just give in to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ridiculous suit?</v>

899
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got my first,</v>

900
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.570
<v Speaker 3>like really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the one I wore a,</v>

901
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I forget what special it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta like I've,</v>

902
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I've done this occasionally throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>the years and I used to wear a Santa hat</v>

903
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 3>for a while and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

904
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.860
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we dress up and just fucking </v>

905
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.040
<v Speaker 3>dumb shit sometimes just because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bored like Muslim prayer robes on stage.</v>

906
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Where were you getting these ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this.</v>

907
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.840
<v Speaker 3>My neighbor Evelyn found this great old </v>
<v Speaker 3>plaid vintage 70 sport coat and I just </v>

908
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 3>happened to find a pair of yellow pants </v>
<v Speaker 3>that matched it perfectly.</v>

909
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.920
<v Speaker 3>So then I'd start like really looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for when I could put a whole suit </v>

910
00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.290
<v Speaker 3>together and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

911
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 3>and then I realized white shoes go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's white loafers.</v>

912
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.940
<v Speaker 3>So then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

913
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 3>that's all we do when we're driving on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>

914
00:45:34.921 --> 00:45:39.921
<v Speaker 3>The only interest I have are we hit all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thrift stores in the town and uh,</v>

915
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 3>try to find good Sushi and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to a fucking museum.</v>

916
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.310
<v Speaker 3>So you look for wacky clothes to try on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

917
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.120
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

918
00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Now I have a closet that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I do these Ebay yard sales </v>

919
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.341
<v Speaker 3>every couple years and I sell all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suits I'm tired of because my closet is </v>

<v Speaker 3>if I ever recorded that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about how you,</v>

953
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 3>the in the polyester under hot lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

954
00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can only imagine how bad fucking had</v>

955
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:46.591
<v Speaker 3>to smell in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was dancing all night at the </v>

956
00:47:46.591 --> 00:47:50.540
<v Speaker 3>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>54 and oh know doing blow and then </v>

957
00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 3>sweating and then fucking in a bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all their pubes on and</v>

958
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no deodorant.</v>

959
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 4>What was deodorant like back then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was terrible.</v>

960
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guard Aerosol.</v>

961
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:05.340
<v Speaker 4>That's what I grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when everybody thought there </v>

962
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.690
<v Speaker 4>was gonna be a giant hole in the ozone </v>
<v Speaker 4>layer from the hairspray.</v>

963
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Hairspray's going to put a hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ozone layer and like apparently there's </v>

964
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 4>a big hole above Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia has it bad.</v>

965
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Like there's all those skin cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>do different.</v>

966
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very rapidly in Australia.</v>

967
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a hole over there if </v>

968
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 4>they ever really remember that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there it is right over Australia.</v>

969
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a God damn hole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the image of the largest Antarctic ozone</v>

970
00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:34.150
<v Speaker 4>hole ever recorded over the South Pole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>September 2006 layers of the atmosphere.</v>

971
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:39.151
<v Speaker 4>Not to scale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ozone layer is mainly found in the </v>

972
00:48:39.151 --> 00:48:42.331
<v Speaker 4>lower portion of the stratosphere from </v>
<v Speaker 4>approximately 20 to 30 kilometers ozone </v>

973
00:48:42.331 --> 00:48:43.420
<v Speaker 4>depletion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a whole.</v>

974
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

975
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 4>if the whole world was underneath that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole,</v>

976
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 4>we'd have some fucking real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You play Australia?</v>

977
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have been.</v>

978
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been in awhile though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last time I did a Melbourne had a great </v>

979
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 4>time or how do they make you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Melvin Melvin.</v>

980
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 4>I like Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Done Sydney there too.</v>

981
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 4>They're nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are fantastic.</v>

982
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

983
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite.</v>

984
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.280
<v Speaker 3>And I did a Hobart Tasmania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

985
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tasmania.</v>

986
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 3>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

987
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:19.141
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a couple of weeks there in April </v>

988
00:49:19.141 --> 00:49:21.770
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read it's called the uh,</v>

989
00:49:21.771 --> 00:49:26.771
<v Speaker 3>the fatal shore and it's like this 700 </v>
<v Speaker 3>page history of Australia and it's </v>

990
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:30.680
<v Speaker 3>fucking brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

991
00:49:30.681 --> 00:49:33.320
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely brutal,</v>

992
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 3>or from the time they started shipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners there for nothing,</v>

993
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.360
<v Speaker 3>their shackles and dying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pestilence.</v>

994
00:49:44.361 --> 00:49:45.020
<v Speaker 3>They're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

995
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 3>in halls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sit in boats for months waiting to </v>

996
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.570
<v Speaker 3>be shipped to a camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just brutal after brutal.</v>

997
00:49:53.571 --> 00:49:56.870
<v Speaker 3>And then a flogging until the skin fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>off his back.</v>

998
00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

999
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.000
<v Speaker 3>and then you do an interview where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going,</v>

1000
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people need comedy in these times </v>

1001
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 3>because there are worse than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1002
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.751
<v Speaker 3>have you read your fucking history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is not the fucking worst thing </v>

1003
00:50:10.751 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at your own fucking </v>

1004
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did some dark shit</v>

1005
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.440
<v Speaker 4>to the aborigines too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1006
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:22.130
<v Speaker 4>One of the things they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took a aborigine kids away from </v>

1007
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:23.880
<v Speaker 4>their parents and they tried to raise </v>
<v Speaker 4>him with a white families.</v>

1008
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like the 19 fifties I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were telling me it when I was </v>

1009
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.591
<v Speaker 4>there and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one of them jaw dropper </v>

1010
00:50:32.591 --> 00:50:32.591
<v Speaker 4>conversations where people were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1011
00:50:32.591 --> 00:50:37.380
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they stole people's babies and </v>

1012
00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.751
<v Speaker 4>raise them as white kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like because they didn't think the </v>

1013
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 4>aborigines knew what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just said,</v>

1014
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to raise that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me that kid.</v>

1015
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:46.430
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda like the foster system will </v>
<v Speaker 4>know because they took them.</v>

1016
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the foster system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea would be that someone would </v>

1017
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 4>either have to go to jail or someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be murdered,</v>

1018
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.910
<v Speaker 3>heard or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have.</v>

1019
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.790
<v Speaker 3>You're an unfit parent.</v>

1020
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 4>That's sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1021
00:50:58.581 --> 00:50:59.750
<v Speaker 4>I guess that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1022
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:04.751
<v Speaker 4>If someone's a drug addict or a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'll take your kid away and put </v>

1023
00:51:04.751 --> 00:51:08.021
<v Speaker 4>it in foster care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is just taking your kid away </v>

1024
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:08.021
<v Speaker 4>because you're an aborigine.</v>

1025
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Which if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if their society thinks that's a bad </v>

1026
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with a drug addict?</v>

1027
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I know drug addicts do a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>functionally.</v>

1028
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1029
00:51:18.821 --> 00:51:23.821
<v Speaker 4>Levels to that is levels of drug addict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's weird about the </v>

1030
00:51:23.821 --> 00:51:24.760
<v Speaker 4>aborigines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have hundreds of languages.</v>

1031
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1032
00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 4>they speak different language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

1033
00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.110
<v Speaker 4>you'll be in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call a mob.</v>

1034
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:33.640
<v Speaker 4>They call themselves mom's like a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mob and you'll have a mob,</v>

1035
00:51:33.641 --> 00:51:37.450
<v Speaker 4>but there'll be another mob that's 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>kilometers away and they speak a totally</v>

1036
00:51:37.451 --> 00:51:42.451
<v Speaker 4>different language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what the fuck they're </v>

1037
00:51:42.451 --> 00:51:44.221
<v Speaker 4>saying and then there's another one over</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and most of it's not even written </v>

1038
00:51:44.221 --> 00:51:46.330
<v Speaker 4>down and there's hundreds and hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them and they're all over the.</v>

1039
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1040
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange culture.</v>

1041
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Like the culture of the aborigines in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>

1042
00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:54.790
<v Speaker 4>My friend Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam Green tree,</v>

1043
00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:00.510
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he runs a mining company in Australia </v>

1044
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.370
<v Speaker 4>and he works with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aboriginal people that get some jobs and</v>

1045
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.940
<v Speaker 4>gets to understand their culture and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to them.</v>

1046
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:10.980
<v Speaker 4>He's told me some just insane shit about</v>
<v Speaker 4>how these people have lived and they'd </v>

1047
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.570
<v Speaker 4>been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1048
00:52:12.571 --> 00:52:16.060
<v Speaker 4>they've been there for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All living in these little tribes,</v>

1049
00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:16.990
<v Speaker 4>these little moms.</v>

1050
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.230
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:52:19.231 --> 00:52:22.830
<v Speaker 3>They would have no structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they first showed up over there,</v>

1052
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 3>the aborigines were basically packs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically cut and burn or you know,</v>

1053
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:34.790
<v Speaker 3>they hunt as much as they could in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>area and they didn't have houses.</v>

1054
00:52:35.521 --> 00:52:38.250
<v Speaker 3>They had no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to just move on.</v>

1055
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 4>And they were living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1057
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:47.590
<v Speaker 4>like essentially like how native </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans were maybe in the 14,</v>

1058
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:51.560
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of 15 centers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably even more simply.</v>

1059
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1060
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just there.</v>

1061
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why they wouldn't fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand because the,</v>

1062
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 3>the Mowery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you pronounce that,</v>

1063
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:07.810
<v Speaker 3>the Maori people would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were fucking bad asses and they </v>

1064
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 3>were somewhat fortified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1065
00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've retained so little.</v>

1066
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:15.311
<v Speaker 3>I read the book and I have two days </v>
<v Speaker 3>later I have like three facts that I'd </v>

1067
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 3>probably have two of them wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1068
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 3>they weren't terrified of the fucking.</v>

1069
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's scared of the mowery's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's scared of just New Zealand.</v>

1070
00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:25.020
<v Speaker 4>People are very fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fierce.</v>

1071
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to think that those two </v>

1072
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.181
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular Australia was a prison </v>

1073
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 2>colony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially free for England.</v>

1074
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1075
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.080
<v Speaker 2>that's how they treated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1076
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking slavery is what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was white slavery because they there.</v>

1077
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea was to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners build this into a country.</v>

1078
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy thing is the weather's way </v>

1079
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.461
<v Speaker 2>better than anyone I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only fucking England would use the </v>

1080
00:53:58.461 --> 00:54:02.031
<v Speaker 2>beautiful place as a fucking penal </v>
<v Speaker 2>colony and can't wait to get back to </v>

1081
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:08.061
<v Speaker 2>fucking shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Share him by the sea where it's fucking </v>

1082

<v Speaker 2>gloomy,</v>

1083
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:13.400
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's just sour and dour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1084
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you're in the Gold Coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia jumping into the water,</v>

1085
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 2>having a Martini on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weather's perfect.</v>

1086
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but same token.</v>

1087
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Back then there was no fucking plumbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was hard to find clean water to </v>

1088
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 2>drink and that's true.</v>

1115
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:46.431
<v Speaker 2>these crocodiles that were killing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that lived in this village </v>

1116
00:55:46.431 --> 00:55:49.940
<v Speaker 2>while they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone got snatched and taken by a </v>

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:06.201
<v Speaker 2>getting eaten everywhere they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're free of getting eaten by these </v>

1122
00:56:06.201 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>enormous Nile crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 feet long.</v>

1124
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Just grabbing people and pulling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>under water.</v>

1125
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I really want to go to the outback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a train,</v>

1126
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you have to train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one's called the Gan that goes from </v>

1127
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Adelaide all the way up to Darwin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have another that goes</v>

1128
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 3>all the way from Perth to Sydney and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to just do a train trip </v>

1129
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 3>because in the middle there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooper pd is a mining town where most of</v>

1130
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 3>the town is underground because it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hot.</v>

1131
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 3>It's 120 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they built the town underground.</v>

1132
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go see some weird shit.</v>

1134
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Sydney is fucking Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1135
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:47.170
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1136
00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the weird shit.</v>

1137
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And you could</v>

1138
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 4>drive for hours and hours and not see </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1139
00:56:52.881 --> 00:56:54.950
<v Speaker 4>In Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these guys,</v>

1140
00:56:54.951 --> 00:56:59.690
<v Speaker 4>they get those snorkels on their cars </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not for going under water.</v>

1141
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just because the amount of dirt you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to drive through.</v>

1142
00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:10.520
<v Speaker 4>above your car so that you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaner air.</v>

1145
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Now they all have extended gas tanks to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get these giant gas tanks put on because</v>

1146
00:57:15.561 --> 00:57:17.360
<v Speaker 4>they know they're going to be driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 15,</v>

1147
00:57:17.361 --> 00:57:21.050
<v Speaker 4>16 hours without seeing a gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>

1148
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.210
<v Speaker 4>That's why I thought the train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird place,</v>

1150
00:57:25.731 --> 00:57:30.731
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia is one of the last weird </v>

1151
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:33.341
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 20 million people in the entire </v>

1152
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:35.900
<v Speaker 4>country and it's the same size as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contiguous United States of dirt.</v>

1153
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 4>It's all dirt and there's only 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people less than live in la.</v>

1154
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Live in this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge country.</v>

1155
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a small town but a country you</v>

1156
00:57:46.741 --> 00:57:48.530
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the same proportions</v>

1157
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:53.930
<v Speaker 3>and it's all Darwin is the only one I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go to that's north and really </v>

1158
00:57:54.001 --> 00:57:56.310
<v Speaker 3>tropical or do you want to go to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one?</v>

1159
00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.430
<v Speaker 3>It just sounds like a weird place to go</v>

1160
00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 4>that it's sloppy goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where Darwin did all of his </v>

1161
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:04.820
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Galapagos Islands,</v>

1162
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.750
<v Speaker 4>some of his research compiling his </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories on evolution,</v>

1163
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:12.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's apparently some crazy tropical </v>
<v Speaker 4>island that's.</v>

1164
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.760
<v Speaker 4>They're trying so hard to keep it from </v>
<v Speaker 4>being touched and influenced by people,</v>

1165
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.640
<v Speaker 4>but every time people go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to clean off their shoes.</v>

1166
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1167
00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:20.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1168
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the don't step off the track,</v>

1169
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 3>but what's the fucking go back in time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Butterfly Effect.</v>

1170
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1171
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1172
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1173
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 4>People are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everywhere,</v>

1174
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that how life got spread all </v>

1175
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 4>across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1176
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I know we shouldn't do it on purpose and</v>
<v Speaker 4>foolishly,</v>

1177
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 4>but I mean a lot of how life got spread </v>
<v Speaker 4>is just things,</v>

1178
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.630
<v Speaker 4>picking things up and carrying them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their shit and dropping them off there </v>

1179
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.200
<v Speaker 4>and this germs and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really how everything gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>spread.</v>

1181
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:56.110
<v Speaker 4>We're just doing it on a larger scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we use planes and boats and like</v>

1182
00:58:56.111 --> 00:59:01.111
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything on Hawaii is something </v>

1183
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:03.631
<v Speaker 4>somebody brought over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some birds that used to </v>

1184
00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:04.570
<v Speaker 4>live there and some bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1185
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.970
<v Speaker 4>and everything else is all the different</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife,</v>

1186
00:59:06.971 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 4>all the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just been brought over there.</v>

1187
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 3>The other worst than going to Hawaii </v>
<v Speaker 3>here in white people,</v>

1188
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About the tourists,</v>

1189
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.570
<v Speaker 3>white people that live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1191
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.620
<v Speaker 3>And how tourism is destroying ecosystem.</v>

1192
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Elon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are you?</v>

1193
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.120
<v Speaker 1>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what would you do without the </v>

1194
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.120
<v Speaker 1>tourists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1195
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1196
00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne's going to actually fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money off a macadamia nut farm.</v>

1197
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I think she's going to be out selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking nuts somewhere.</v>

1198
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she never had.</v>

1199
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.860
<v Speaker 1>She never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1200
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she called me again.</v>

1201
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to do Rogan.</v>

1202
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 1>We've been going back and forth now she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says she's gonna do her own podcast.</v>

1203
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just gonna take time.</v>

1204
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told this is what I told her.</v>

1205
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>She said she contacted me the day says </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to do it whenever you are.</v>

1206
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just tell me when and we'll do it.</v>

1207
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And then we're trying to figure out I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Salt Lake City.</v>

1208
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm on either other sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little bit of that and then,</v>

1209
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just trying to figure out when's </v>

1210
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the right time.</v>

1211
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>But she said she wants to do her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel and she's,</v>

1212
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>she's upset at everybody and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I felt like,</v>

1213
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

1214
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of merit and what she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1215
01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do think she got fucked over.</v>

1216
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1217
01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I really do think she made a joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman that she didn't know was black </v>

1218
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and a woman who's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's the only one eighth.</v>

1219
01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1220
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the picture and I like,</v>

1221
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1222
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>She talked to her on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards where she goes,</v>

1223
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>she was asking me for advice and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

1224
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I really fucked up and I honestly didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think she was black.</v>

1225
01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever do ambien?</v>

1226
01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:56.141
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why I stopped doing </v>

1227
01:00:56.141 --> 01:00:58.541
<v Speaker 1>ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure that's why she tweeted that</v>

1228
01:00:58.881 --> 01:01:03.881
<v Speaker 1>where I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talk about this on Rogan because </v>

1229
01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:03.881
<v Speaker 1>Rogan spends time.</v>

1230
01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You can explain stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop fucking tweeting.</v>

1231
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Tweet where she goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did take an ambient.</v>

1236
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:27.911
<v Speaker 1>because he on a flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took an Ambien and had a couple of </v>

01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck your brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember my ex renee,</v>

1264
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>her brother and his buddy took some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambience,</v>

1265
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>had minor amounts of cocktails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up on a lawn in a neighborhood they</v>

1266
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't know where they were cheeses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it was.</v>

1267
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>That one lucid business conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go,</v>

1268
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>that could have been me driving my car </v>
<v Speaker 1>into someone's front fucking porch.</v>

1269
01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1270
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swore it off.</v>

1271
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.990
<v Speaker 1>My Mom said that she took it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no booze,</v>

1272
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>just took the ambient and wound up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on a bathroom.</v>

1273
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Carpet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1274
01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>in the little bathroom rugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just drawing on with like lipstick and,</v>

1275
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and nail pause doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>recollection of doing it.</v>

1276
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Just drawing on it like a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>would where they pulled the nail Polish.</v>

1277
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Just start.</v>

1278
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a hypnotic,</v>

1279
01:03:24.481 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what they called that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that category of drugs.</v>

1280
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 1>The other thing with Roseanne is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1281
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got serious mental illness and </v>

1282
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>she's on a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>medications as well.</v>

1283
01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:40.200
<v Speaker 1>She's got legit multiple personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

1284
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:45.201
<v Speaker 1>She's talked about it and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it multiple personality </v>

1285
01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 1>disorder anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a new name for it,</v>

1286
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but since the noise rebranding fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illnesses,</v>

1287
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

1288
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is multiple personality disorder.</v>

1289
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 1>She has a bunch of different people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:02.931
<v Speaker 1>if you talked to people that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around her and see or switch from </v>

1291
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:02.931
<v Speaker 1>personality to personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>

1292
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1293
01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this also came from head </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>

1294
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>She's one of several comedians that </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a different person because of </v>

1295
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>head trauma.</v>

1296
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I think she was hit by a car as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison,</v>

1297
01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:20.331
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit by a car and also she was in a car </v>

1298
01:04:20.331 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was child molestation</v>

1299
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 1>or rape and disassociative identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

1300
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:30.741
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're calling it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she also can't fucking tell the </v>

1301
01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:35.001
<v Speaker 1>difference between twitter and a green </v>
<v Speaker 1>room because if every single comic was </v>

1302
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark shit that we say in green rooms</v>

1303
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>because we're comics and we saved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst possible thing,</v>

1304
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>especially to make each other laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you go to the darkest areas and </v>

1305
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:53.121
<v Speaker 1>you say all the wrong words and you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most racist thing to your black </v>

1306
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:59.511
<v Speaker 1>comic friend and he says the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst thing to you about your fucking </v>

1307
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>ugly fucking teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're fat or you're fucking stupid,</v>

1308
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>and if she walked into the green room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said that about that lady,</v>

1309
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>we would be laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1310
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:14.330
<v Speaker 1>We'd be laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if we know who she was and </v>

1311
01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 1>then I didn't know Ashley was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something racist.</v>

1312
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You'd look at the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1313
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>don't</v>

1314
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no understanding of who that woman</v>

1315
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:25.471
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had heard of her before until </v>

1316
01:05:25.471 --> 01:05:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Rosana got fired and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this lady in?</v>

1317
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>She's saying she's the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brotherhood,</v>

1318
01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>and then Rosanne said that she thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was Jewish and I was like,</v>

1319
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think she was black,</v>

1320
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought she was Jewish and I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture.</v>

1321
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1322
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking that's a,</v>

1323
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:45.630
<v Speaker 2>that's not a cut and dry one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read two years of Roseanne's </v>

1324
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:50.371
<v Speaker 2>tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would not be the one that stood </v>

1325
01:05:50.371 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just says fucking insane stuff.</v>

1326
01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:56.470
<v Speaker 2>That makes no sense all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she say that Susan Rice,</v>

1327
01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 2>she said she was a great big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1328
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.030
<v Speaker 2>big ape with no a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1329
01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:07.210
<v Speaker 2>she's a man with giant swinging a balls.</v>

1330
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:15.420
<v Speaker 2>This was like five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then five years later they give her </v>

1331
01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.300
<v Speaker 2>that Sitcom and can't believe she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting crazy.</v>

1332
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I completely fault ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seen a fucking cash cow that.</v>

1333
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:24.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1334
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 2>they thought they could handle her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1335
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 2>we can make a lot of money by giving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>toddler a pistol.</v>

1336
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what else she said she felt </v>

1337
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:36.090
<v Speaker 2>like she promised not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she felt.</v>

1338
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.070
<v Speaker 2>She felt like she was being removed from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creative process to.</v>

1339
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of things going on </v>

1340
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.480
<v Speaker 2>even before this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like one of the final steps,</v>

1341
01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:48.481
<v Speaker 2>but that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was having a hard time with the </v>

1342
01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:50.881
<v Speaker 2>whole process and she was definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a hard time with being </v>

1343
01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:50.881
<v Speaker 2>overworked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1344
01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I am all about the Illuminati and Zion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1345
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should get you out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer's room.</v>

1346
01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Will not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be a bad idea to do an episode </v>

1347
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.140
<v Speaker 2>about her thinking that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati mean.</v>

1348
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking gold comedy there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much there.</v>

1349
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I had explained to her chem trails like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is be different than </v>

1350
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 2>anybody that I've ever talked to about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of wacky conspiracy theories.</v>

1351
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.450
<v Speaker 2>When I explained to her what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1352
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 2>how those clouds are made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went,</v>

1353
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1354
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like most of them,</v>

1355
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tell them that,</v>

1356
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see those planes,</v>

1357
01:07:23.951 --> 01:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>they're spraying overhead and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1358
01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:25.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1359
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It's the heat of the engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the condensation and the atmosphere is </v>

1360
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:33.451
<v Speaker 2>actually creating a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the water vapor and it mixes </v>

1361
01:07:33.451 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 2>with the heat of this engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes clouds.</v>

1362
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosanna just goes,</v>

1363
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let it go.</v>

1364
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody else is like bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1365
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking documents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's papers.</v>

1366
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:48.090
<v Speaker 2>The CIA's admitted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the hardest things in the </v>

1367
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:48.700
<v Speaker 2>world when you get a stupid conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory in your head.</v>

1368
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the hardest things the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to just go.</v>

1369
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.130
<v Speaker 2>That might be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be bullshit.</v>

1370
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:54.650
<v Speaker 2>What's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1371
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>what's your latest favorite conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory?</v>

1372
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I've dropped off the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The favorite one that I believe in.</v>

1373
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Man,</v>

1374
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a good one that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1375
01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Are there new ones that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

1376

1427
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Only in this presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would this be something that we would </v>

1428
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:48.740
<v Speaker 2>think about only this is the like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1431
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:58.021
<v Speaker 2>Melania leaves him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get a double because you </v>

1432
01:10:58.021 --> 01:10:58.021
<v Speaker 2>going to get a body double is just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give her money.</v>

1433
01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:03.120
<v Speaker 3>It could just go hooked up with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>chick on tinder.</v>

1434
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at what point are people going to </v>

1435
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.861
<v Speaker 3>stop being completely be fuddled that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said something and</v>

1436
01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.850
<v Speaker 2>stormy Daniels got arrested yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1437
01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.110

<v Speaker 2>that's some bullshit.</v>

1438
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Sue's touching an undercover cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it she was touching on the cover </v>

1439
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>crop or she allow the undercover cop to </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch her?</v>

1440
01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:32.230
<v Speaker 5>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I read from her attorney last </v>

1441
01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:36.370
<v Speaker 5>night on twitter is that she'd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the same show or whatever </v>

1442
01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:36.370
<v Speaker 5>performance she's been doing all over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the country.</v>

1443
01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:36.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what she does,</v>

1444
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:39.920
<v Speaker 5>that she was going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was almost a setup or something.</v>

1445
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't blowing a guy in a fucking,</v>

1446
01:11:42.561 --> 01:11:44.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the champagne room or something.</v>

1447
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:50.830
<v Speaker 2>When you read the law it said the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that you can't touch someone in an </v>

1448
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:56.540
<v Speaker 2>adult establishment unless it's a family</v>
<v Speaker 2>member.</v>

1449
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:59.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1450
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.510
<v Speaker 2>So you walked over to Jamie and rubbed </v>
<v Speaker 2>his back.</v>

1451
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:06.530
<v Speaker 2>You'd go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless we're related.</v>

1452
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.480
<v Speaker 2>We haven't done a 23 employee who </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly appears nude or semi nude in a</v>

1453
01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:16.481
<v Speaker 2>sexually oriented business is prohibited</v>
<v Speaker 2>from touching patrons except for family </v>

1454
01:12:16.481 --> 01:12:16.481
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1455
01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it goes.</v>

1459
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:25.080
<v Speaker 2>The charges were dismissed according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>court documents,</v>

1460
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:27.700
<v Speaker 5>so it almost makes it more news that she</v>
<v Speaker 5>was arrested.</v>

1461
01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it was like a rogue cop </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like a fucking trump fan was like,</v>

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:13.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is what got us here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>

1485
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.400
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't here for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not like she did that to a trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer with a gun to a cop.</v>

1487
01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not like even a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy who makes his living stopping</v>

1488
01:13:42.581 --> 01:13:46.120
<v Speaker 2>crime and she stopped being fun Vice </v>

1491
01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.910

<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

1607
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:33.400
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is a really good documentary.</v>

1608
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1609
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 3>there's just the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild west.</v>

1610
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Wild country is</v>

1611
01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:44.060
<v Speaker 4>about a sex cult that took over a town </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Oregon.</v>

1612
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 80.</v>

1613
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one I was looking for,</v>

1614
01:19:48.101 --> 01:19:52.690
<v Speaker 3>but I know it was the Bhagwan shree rush</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

1615
01:19:52.691 --> 01:19:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to search Bhagwan how do I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even know how to spell that.</v>

1616
01:19:57.161 --> 01:20:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even know how to spell that </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough for Google to correct it.</v>

1617
01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I know about this whole thing before the</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary series came out.</v>

1618
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never heard of it,</v>

1619
01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1620
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 2>not in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've heard it's a fucking brilliant </v>

1621
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know the name it.</v>

1622
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1623
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed I could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.</v>

1624
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd just call them Osho.</v>

1625
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 2>It's with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them later.</v>

1626
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's A.</v>

1627
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never.</v>

1628

1630
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.500
<v Speaker 2>So when this documentary series came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 2>that whole story until it went down or </v>
<v Speaker 2>until the documentary series went down.</v>

1667
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.340
<v Speaker 2>I never heard that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>When you see it,</v>

1678
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you realize the scope of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see the old home movies,</v>

1679
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you realize like,</v>

1683
01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have the ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't turn it into this town.</v>

1684
01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:03.590
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't develop on it the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to because they were.</v>

1685
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:07.560
<v Speaker 2>They were recognizing that these were </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming like a,</v>

1686
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:13.250
<v Speaker 2>a giant caught that was next door and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people are moving in and so </v>

1687
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.250
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>tiny little house or a tiny little town?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just like a busy type place.</v>

1692
01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:26.580
<v Speaker 2>They start buying everybody's house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they started shipping in homeless </v>

<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shipped and homeless people and </v>

1694
01:23:29.731 --> 01:23:29.731

<v Speaker 2>they took these people and that they </v>

1700
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.870
<v Speaker 2>made them a part of the community and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they used them for voting and they took </v>

1701
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.870
<v Speaker 2>over this town.</v>

<v Speaker 3>your fan base to fuck off and I don't </v>

<v Speaker 3>What I'm getting is a lot of fucking </v>

1793
01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:11.640
<v Speaker 3>mag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking Nazi type shitheads like are </v>

1794
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.510
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1795
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it on stage last night that the </v>

1796
01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:22.051
<v Speaker 3>same way people can be offended at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzword without hearing the whole bit </v>

1797
01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:28.620
<v Speaker 3>because you said contar retard or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that they just completely </v>

1798
01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.790
<v Speaker 3>tuned out and walk out without hearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the context of the whole piece of </v>

1799
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:37.411
<v Speaker 3>material the same way people can become </v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to you because you said,</v>

1800
01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faggot Jew without hearing the context </v>

1801
01:28:46.061 --> 01:28:49.920
<v Speaker 3>of the bit and like I'm having to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1802
01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want you as a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have enough fans.</v>

1803
01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:58.300
<v Speaker 3>I've lived my little niche base and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go away and like the Libertarians,</v>

1804
01:28:58.301 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I have to distance myself from them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that was always a split</v>

1805
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.820
<v Speaker 1>of know civil libertarians and legalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

1806
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 1>That versus snake handling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooling,</v>

1807
01:29:14.611 --> 01:29:19.611
<v Speaker 1>Christian types that don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government involved in them raising </v>

1808
01:29:19.611 --> 01:29:21.600
<v Speaker 1>freak kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's like,</v>

1809
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:25.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems like all the good parts are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>just anti-trump,</v>

1810
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:30.290
<v Speaker 1>like we have to vote Democrat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad parts of the libertarians are the </v>

1811
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:33.530
<v Speaker 1>whole now where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fucking lit.</v>

1812
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I Lean Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the party,</v>

1813
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.620
<v Speaker 1>but the ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leaned that way,</v>

1814
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not calling myself a libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because there's a bunch of </v>

1815
01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all of them,</v>

1816
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:52.220
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying a lot of people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become the good parts have left.</v>

1817
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just a problem with </v>

1818
01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:00.510
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have groups you're going to</v>

1819
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:05.511
<v Speaker 1>have the fringe and when you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fringe was the French stupid or the </v>

1820
01:30:05.511 --> 01:30:05.511
<v Speaker 1>fringe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical.</v>

1821
01:30:05.511 --> 01:30:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the fringe radical left.</v>

1822
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.120
<v Speaker 1>They sort of define the group and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1823
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a group that anybody can</v>
<v Speaker 1>join,</v>

1824
01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 1>like do you have libertarian ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1825
01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:17.811
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I support a lot of libertarian </v>

1826
01:30:17.811 --> 01:30:17.811
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1827
01:30:17.811 --> 01:30:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Become a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be with us,</v>

1828
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

1829
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know Dave Smith at all from </v>
<v Speaker 1>legionnaires.</v>

1830
01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1831
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:28.190
<v Speaker 1>different guy.</v>

1832
01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So legitimate libertarian had they.</v>

1833

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he.</v>

1834
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Did you do the skanks in a legion of </v>

1848
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

1849
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.240
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than it would be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

1850
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:17.300
<v Speaker 1>no fan thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck were we just talking </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:31:18.721 --> 01:31:20.730

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1854
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like identifying as a right wing,</v>

1855
01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:27.020
<v Speaker 1>identifying as a left way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1856
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:29.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people that identify.</v>

1857
01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You just grab those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually one issue.</v>

1858
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1859
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:41.100

1860
01:31:41.101 --> 01:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>your abortion.</v>

1861
01:31:43.981 --> 01:31:48.981
<v Speaker 1>you have to be left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's the right wing people that </v>

1862
01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:48.981
<v Speaker 1>go pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get attacked.</v>

1863
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:55.230
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those weird things where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think racism will stop them.</v>

1864
01:31:56.341 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Overturning Roe vs Dot Wade.</v>

1867
01:32:05.630 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 3>all these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be the only way.</v>

1868
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always on Frankie Boyle show and I</v>

1926
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 1>attention to the stock market and really</v>

01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Really doing the research on the </v>

01:35:20.151 --> 01:35:25.151
<v Speaker 1>I don't of course know it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get reports and I see if this number </v>

1929
01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 1>is higher than this number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has no fucking time.</v>

1930
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no time for you.</v>

1931
01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:39.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no time because you do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and you're very ambitious to two.</v>

1932
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.320
<v Speaker 1>A two and almost a pathological extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I have all the fucking time in the</v>

1933
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 1>world and I'm always riddled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

1934
01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do nothing but I can enjoy it.</v>

1935
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's something I should be </v>

1936
01:35:58.930 --> 01:35:58.930
<v Speaker 1>dealing all the time too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I'm,</v>

1937
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm paralyzed in bed because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it is they should be doing.</v>

1938
01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I know there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you do more things,</v>

1939
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:13.150
<v Speaker 1>that feeling goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do like if you do things that </v>

1940
01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really tuned into things that are</v>

1941
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:18.380
<v Speaker 1>like require your attention than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety of not doing things goes away.</v>

1942
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Then it just becomes a matter of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1943
01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to enjoy doing nothing.</v>

1944
01:36:22.551 --> 01:36:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Like I told you after this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time this airs it'll be Monday </v>

1945
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:31.610
<v Speaker 1>and I will be retired and I do this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>often as I can.</v>

1946
01:36:31.611 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Every few years I quit comedy in my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I just.</v>

1947
01:36:35.691 --> 01:36:37.010

1954
01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:58.460
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this.</v>

1955
01:36:58.461 --> 01:37:02.510
<v Speaker 1>You're starting a new hour ruthless as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was process.</v>

1956
01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>So I want to have that moment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally where I go,</v>

1957
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I can do anything in the world right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can fuck off.</v>

1959
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I could write another book or I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1960
01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I have no commitment just having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still won't enjoy it because </v>

1961
01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety fueled to go.</v>

1962
01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I should do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1963
01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:29.561
<v Speaker 1>we're always looking for a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always looking for that moment of </v>

1964
01:37:29.561 --> 01:37:29.561
<v Speaker 1>relaxation.</v>

1965
01:37:29.561 --> 01:37:30.110
<v Speaker 1>A moment of I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1966
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:34.580
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes your brain is a wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means having nothing.</v>

1967
01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to have a gig booked a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking year from now.</v>

1968
01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:40.940

<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>legal pad and she knows my act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I come up with something new,</v>

2062
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.570
<v Speaker 2>she'll write that down.</v>

2063
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 2>And the next day in the van Gogh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2064
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said this.</v>

2065
01:41:50.111 --> 01:41:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

2066
01:41:50.861 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to listen to yourself</v>

2067
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:55.950
<v Speaker 2>and cringe for fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2068
01:41:55.990 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Here's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listening to yourself and cringing is </v>

2069
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>good for the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's the best thing.</v>

2070
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It's good for this thing you can do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I hate myself so </v>

2071
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:09.820
<v Speaker 2>much that it's disheartening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what I sound like?</v>

2072
01:42:09.821 --> 01:42:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking suck.</v>

2073
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:16.930
<v Speaker 2>A familiarity breeds contempt and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's yourself too.</v>

2074
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:21.931
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be worth a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be hypercritical of </v>

2075
01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:21.931
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fact.</v>

2076
01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:24.160
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching or listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and just like,</v>

2077
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

2078
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I heckled myself alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to myself and dropbox and I'm </v>

2079
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get to the fucking point.</v>

2080
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Yelling at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you record with you?</v>

2081
01:42:38.861 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Record with your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daily records using an MP,</v>

2082
01:42:42.971 --> 01:42:47.971
<v Speaker 2>three players to little unit that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the road and we just bring two </v>

2083
01:42:48.821 --> 01:42:52.090
<v Speaker 2>mikes to podcast on that little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zoom?</v>

2084
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zoom.</v>

2085
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be better at I,</v>

2086
01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:59.961
<v Speaker 2>I do it on my phone just so I have them </v>
<v Speaker 2>there all the time and then I listened </v>

2087
01:42:59.961 --> 01:43:02.740
<v Speaker 2>to him on my way home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have a ritual I listened to set on</v>

2088
01:43:02.741 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 2>the way home unless I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I do a set and I'm like that was</v>

2089
01:43:06.401 --> 01:43:08.860
<v Speaker 2>just textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this by the book on autopilot.</v>

2090
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:09.340
<v Speaker 2>That one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2091
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>but if there was some new bit or one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those stand up on the spot shows I </v>

2092
01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:19.501
<v Speaker 2>listened to it all the way home and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I get home then I'll break out the </v>

2093
01:43:19.501 --> 01:43:19.501
<v Speaker 2>laptop.</v>

2094
01:43:19.501 --> 01:43:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll start writing just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2095
01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I got the spark going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what the fuck comes out of </v>

2096
01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:25.900
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just feel like a lot of it is just</v>

2097
01:43:25.901 --> 01:43:27.970
<v Speaker 2>throwing shit against the wall until </v>
<v Speaker 2>something sticks.</v>

2098
01:43:27.971 --> 01:43:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not out there throwing shit,</v>

2099
01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But bold while you're doing it,</v>

2100
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you can't believe them throwing all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit but then swap a lot of times when </v>

2101
01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:40.480
<v Speaker 2>when you get so bored with a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2102
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any special.</v>

2103
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I probably have three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2104
01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:50.780
<v Speaker 2>this I have to do these three bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're tired of them and then I</v>

2105
01:43:51.381 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>just start</v>

2106
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking around with it just to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting for me.</v>

2107
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of the times where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>

2108
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this works.</v>

2109
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2110
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll find,</v>

2111
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean comedy is one of those weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to do in front of </v>

2112
01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:09.280
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2113
01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you can write and you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get seeds,</v>

2114
01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but you got to plant those seeds in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt of the crowd.</v>

2115
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>This is the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way I can see it.</v>

2116
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I'll come up with a bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done when I come up with it.</v>

2117
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I know I know the premise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a setup,</v>

2118
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I got the punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2119
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:31.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he could bring it to the stage and </v>

2120
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:33.851
<v Speaker 1>never changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's like one out of 100 bits </v>

2121
01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:33.851
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2122
01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was my first show in the states </v>

2123
01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 1>since March.</v>

2124
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I started in Southeast Asia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and Canada and the UK and I </v>

2125
01:44:43.971 --> 01:44:48.971
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of these tags are going to </v>

2126
01:44:48.971 --> 01:44:50.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking work if I ever get back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

2127
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

2128
01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 1>this is not getting what it should get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also.</v>

2129
01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And there was other bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last night was my first show in the </v>

2130
01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 1>states where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to see it.</v>

2131
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's the opposite where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of this is gonna </v>

2132
01:45:07.090 --> 01:45:07.700
<v Speaker 1>work in fucking Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2133
01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to see what works.</v>

2134
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what people will get offended at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they never,</v>

2135
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:17.040
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck in Australia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2136
01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's never too brutal there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that you have with the a seismic </v>

2137
01:45:22.551 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 1>shift in the political and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape now.</v>

2138
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It really has been seismic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2139
01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2140
01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:34.840
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my audience is pretty much immune to </v>

2141
01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about this anymore.</v>

2143
01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My reinforces your audience.</v>

2144
01:45:41.901 --> 01:45:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It reinforces your relationship with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience because they know,</v>

2145
01:45:44.151 --> 01:45:46.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll doug will give us the real deal.</v>

2146
01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.220
<v Speaker 1>He'll give us real comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2147
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 1>people are scared to do real comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

2148
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Real comedy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Requires occasionally requires a fence.</v>

2149
01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2150
01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a sponsor or a network that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sanction me.</v>

2151
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:06.020
<v Speaker 1>They will fire you for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2152
01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her getting fired.</v>

2153
01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:11.900
<v Speaker 1>People getting fired for things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make any sense.</v>

2154
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not popular enough to get protested </v>
<v Speaker 1>or people try to lean on the venue.</v>

2155
01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2156
01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.290

2162
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:46.340

<v Speaker 1>I have to like watch how I phrase things</v>

2163
01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 4>good or for bad and probably for both,</v>

2174
01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:40.060
<v Speaker 4>but there's more communication going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2175
01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Then pretty much ever anytime that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could ever remember</v>

2176
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 3>furrowing my brow at what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication because I think as a lot </v>

2177
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 3>of misinformation,</v>

2178
01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:59.380
<v Speaker 4>not saying like spectacular lines of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that lead to transformative </v>

2179
01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:00.470
<v Speaker 4>dialogues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2180
01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 4>but is it just Yapping pee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>More and more people are yapping and </v>

2181
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.801
<v Speaker 4>comments there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yapping on twitter that yapping on </v>

2182
01:48:08.801 --> 01:48:11.831
<v Speaker 4>facebook and instagram is more yapping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more blogs and yapping and video </v>

2183
01:48:11.961 --> 01:48:16.961
<v Speaker 4>yapping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more communication as a lot of </v>

2184
01:48:16.961 --> 01:48:18.170
<v Speaker 4>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twitter feed where you go,</v>

2185
01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.310
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you used to write jokes on here and now.</v>

2186
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:26.330
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already put a whole thing about all </v>

2187
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:27.770
<v Speaker 4>these comedians like saying things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't even remotely funny about issues</v>

2188
01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and how how uninformed are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those opinions,</v>

2189
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:39.610
<v Speaker 3>like if you questioned a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

2190
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:44.930
<v Speaker 3>like three levels below the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much do you really know about this </v>

2191
01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.240
<v Speaker 3>issue that you're speaking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I remember when I was vaguely,</v>

2192
01:48:52.570 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 3>not even political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was really like into the </v>

2193
01:48:57.570 --> 01:49:00.211
<v Speaker 3>libertarian thing and if you question </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was open about it,</v>

2194
01:49:00.341 --> 01:49:04.120
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything I know on that subject is the</v>

2195
01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:09.121
<v Speaker 3>bit that I did you question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just surface knowledge enough to </v>

2196
01:49:09.521 --> 01:49:14.521
<v Speaker 3>make it funny and then I move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not home studying this shit </v>

2197
01:49:14.521 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 3>afterwards like I know enough to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>salient point which I.</v>

2198
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I can stand behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

2199
01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:24.880
<v Speaker 3>if you had me on a panel talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it now all all I know is the bit.</v>

2200
01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.870
<v Speaker 3>That was the extent of my knowledge with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fist fuck joke at the end.</v>

2201
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Against.</v>

2202
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Too much shit to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2203
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 4>there's no way you could know most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the issues that are pressing today.</v>

2204
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have an actual job,</v>

2205
01:49:40.141 --> 01:49:43.380
<v Speaker 4>but an actual life and friends and shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>you like to do,</v>

2206
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.920
<v Speaker 4>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we've got a bunch of people that are </v>

2207
01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:48.920
<v Speaker 4>arguing about shit that they're not even</v>
<v Speaker 4>barely informed.</v>

2208
01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.860
<v Speaker 3>My brain is beaten to a pulp where I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2209
01:49:50.861 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a book two days later,</v>

2210
01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I remember if I liked it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I might remember one fact from that </v>

2211
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:02.700
<v Speaker 3>that I can turn into a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2212
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2213
01:50:04.610 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think your brain is </v>

2214
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 4>occupying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like W,</v>

2215
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:11.810
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you think it's an operating?</v>

2216
01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you think your brain is operating at </v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of what it was when you were </v>

2217
01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:17.750
<v Speaker 4>21,</v>
<v Speaker 4>75 percent?</v>

2218
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I care about a lot less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2219
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.640
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much of it is that?</v>

2220
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a lot of it is fucking alcohol </v>

2221
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 3>under age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blame the alcohol probably as much as </v>

2223
01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know people that are my age that I</v>

2224
01:50:41.210 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 3>can't remember a fucking thing and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't drink</v>

2225
01:50:44.770 --> 01:50:47.020
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think too many things happen to people</v>

2226
01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:52.021
<v Speaker 4>in their lives too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's impossible to remember </v>

2227
01:50:52.021 --> 01:50:52.021
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2228
01:50:52.021 --> 01:50:56.401
<v Speaker 4>they have that thing where you can only </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep a certain amount of people in your </v>

2229
01:50:56.401 --> 01:50:57.940
<v Speaker 4>brain told Dunbar's number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of people in your tribe,</v>

2230
01:50:57.941 --> 01:51:02.941
<v Speaker 4>like 150 people and keep intimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships with 150 people in your </v>

2231
01:51:02.941 --> 01:51:06.751
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's the case with life </v>

2232
01:51:06.751 --> 01:51:07.300
<v Speaker 4>experiences too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's the case with information.</v>

2233
01:51:07.301 --> 01:51:12.301
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you only have a certain amount </v>

2234
01:51:12.301 --> 01:51:14.641
<v Speaker 4>of database space in your brain and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think some people really exercise it and</v>

2235
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.580
<v Speaker 4>expand the capacity and get it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>impressive,</v>

2236
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.010
<v Speaker 4>but there's still only room for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of shit.</v>

2237
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:26.490
<v Speaker 4>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're really paying attention to </v>

2238
01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:29.161
<v Speaker 4>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other things you kind of kind of </v>

2239
01:51:29.161 --> 01:51:31.021
<v Speaker 4>half ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just the way of being a person </v>

2240
01:51:31.021 --> 01:51:31.021
<v Speaker 4>we're not designed for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2241
01:51:31.021 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 4>a perfect output in every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>category of things that we do.</v>

2242
01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:40.980
<v Speaker 4>We're designed to pay a lot of attention</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some things and as long as like food </v>

2243
01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:44.551
<v Speaker 4>and shelter is taking care of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of barely pay attention to other </v>

2244
01:51:44.551 --> 01:51:44.551
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2245
01:51:44.551 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 4>that's what we do mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but today that the chatter,</v>

2246
01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 4>the Yap and back and forth and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be.</v>

2247
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:50.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've watched.</v>

2248
01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:55.670
<v Speaker 4>I've watched battles like twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>battles all day long sometimes just </v>

2249
01:51:55.670 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 4>watch these people go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just trying to be right.</v>

2250
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:01.780
<v Speaker 4>That's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was never this much because people</v>

2251
01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 4>are doing this mostly probably while </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're at work,</v>

2252
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:09.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's supposed to be doing other shit </v>

2253
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:09.120
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2254
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:09.120
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you you fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucking Nazi,</v>

2255
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:14.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're just typing shit at each </v>

2256
01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.931
<v Speaker 4>other and going back and forth with each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other when they're not getting anything </v>

2257
01:52:15.931 --> 01:52:15.931
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

2258
01:52:15.931 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I have someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an old bit about nationalism,</v>

2259
01:52:20.121 --> 01:52:25.121
<v Speaker 3>but because of the current climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people tweet that clip a lot and then </v>

2260
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 3>because my name is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they start an intellectual twitter </v>

2261
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:33.620
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the worst when people are using</v>

2262
01:52:33.621 --> 01:52:37.250
<v Speaker 3>big words and fucking lots of facts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2263
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:42.370
<v Speaker 3>excerpts from smart fuck magazine in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a twitter battle like right.</v>

2264
01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:47.380
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck your mother and my team's better </v>

2265
01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:50.651
<v Speaker 3>than your team and that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when they're having these entered </v>

2266
01:52:50.651 --> 01:52:53.950
<v Speaker 3>intellectual discourses about whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking climate change her know </v>

2267
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:59.860
<v Speaker 3>nationalism or immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they keep me in the fucking thing </v>

2268
01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:02.750
<v Speaker 3>because it started with a a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a youtube clip.</v>

2269
01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So my name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my handle is in there and they don't </v>

2270
01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.201
<v Speaker 3>take me out of the fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm involved in these long threads </v>

2271
01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 3>between two assholes who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsmart each other.</v>

2272
01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:18.620
<v Speaker 3>You're doing this on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a legitimate argument.</v>

2273
01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:23.621
<v Speaker 3>That's what I told Rosanne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking try to tweet your way out </v>

2274
01:53:23.621 --> 01:53:24.530
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to tweet it all,</v>

2275
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:29.650
<v Speaker 3>just keep tweeting and crazy shit til it</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts the tweet and question into this </v>

2276
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:35.350
<v Speaker 3>fog of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was like a fucking cleaner.</v>

2277
01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way that I would have flown </v>

2278
01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:42.780
<v Speaker 3>to her house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was Ray Donovan,</v>

2279
01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I would have flown her fucking house and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

2280
01:53:44.271 --> 01:53:46.460
<v Speaker 3>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's more ambien.</v>

2281
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Here's more fucking malt liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep doing crazy shit until it's </v>

2282
01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:58.061
<v Speaker 3>completely snowed over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the least of your problems.</v>

2283
01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:09.200
<v Speaker 2>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of the people that are </v>

2284
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.191
<v Speaker 2>tweeting all day are either don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job and they're just addicted to twitter</v>

2285
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:17.890
<v Speaker 2>or they're at work and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking off and it's supposed to be </v>

2286
01:54:17.890 --> 01:54:20.570
<v Speaker 2>working and so this is way more engaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them because they're already stuck in</v>

2287
01:54:20.571 --> 01:54:25.571
<v Speaker 2>this office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're making sport out of like </v>

2288
01:54:25.571 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 2>going after people are getting at people</v>
<v Speaker 2>or communicating with people.</v>

2289
01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:29.340
<v Speaker 2>They're making sport out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2290
01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:34.410
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's flexing their intellectual muscles </v>

2291
01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:37.721
<v Speaker 2>because they're trying to find a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument to your point that makes you </v>

2292
01:54:37.721 --> 01:54:41.351
<v Speaker 2>look fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing it in 280 words is fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was,</v>

2304
01:55:14.101 --> 01:55:19.101
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the late nineties when I did the </v>

2305
01:55:19.101 --> 01:55:23.061
<v Speaker 3>aristocrats and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just make up the joke however you </v>

2306
01:55:23.061 --> 01:55:25.350
<v Speaker 3>want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took like I took verbatim stuff.</v>

2307
01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:29.040
<v Speaker 3>I did baiting pedophiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2308
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2309
01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I almost forgot about you're baiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like you had a website,</v>

2310
01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:36.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the way.</v>

2311
01:55:36.961 --> 01:55:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I had a website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a website,</v>

2312
01:55:38.411 --> 01:55:41.520
<v Speaker 3>and they and they had stopped doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they got bored with it.</v>

2313
01:55:41.521 --> 01:55:45.320
<v Speaker 3>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was painting the fence where it,</v>

2314
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get you to.</v>

2315
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 3>I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2316
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:50.880
<v Speaker 3>can I do this and submit them to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>site?</v>

2317
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we had that much </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time.</v>

2318
01:55:54.451 --> 01:55:59.451
<v Speaker 3>I would spend 14 hour days just trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a fucking full because he'd get </v>

2319
01:56:00.151 --> 01:56:05.151
<v Speaker 3>one that went halfway through and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy fails out because he figures out </v>

2320
01:56:05.151 --> 01:56:07.400
<v Speaker 3>your fuck with them and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>printable and like,</v>

2321
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:12.470
<v Speaker 3>how did I have that much time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember spending 12 hours on like </v>

2322
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 3>free poker sites playing poker and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>trolling the people because you have a,</v>

2323
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can chat while you play poker and </v>

2324
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.250
<v Speaker 3>then fucking with people and just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>an asshole.</v>

2325
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:25.800
<v Speaker 3>And how did I have 14 fucking because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't have a job.</v>

2326
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I still don't have a job and I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>have probably that much free time,</v>

2327
01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.600
<v Speaker 3>but now that I'm successful so I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have to keep doing something </v>

2328
01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 3>productive.</v>

2329
01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also wiser.</v>

2330
01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You realize like how much time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually invented a invested into that </v>

2331
01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:45.380
<v Speaker 2>versus what you got out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2332
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many different pedophiles did you </v>

<v Speaker 2>One of them started talking to me.</v>

2334
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to wait for them to contact you</v>

2335
01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.570
<v Speaker 3>roast the point because you have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile set up.</v>

2336

2339
01:57:04.450 --> 01:57:05.770
<v Speaker 3>However you set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2340
01:57:05.771 --> 01:57:10.771

<v Speaker 3>getting another fucking 13 year old kids</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2343
01:57:14.571 --> 01:57:19.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the amount of time to fucking off </v>

2344
01:57:19.571 --> 01:57:19.571
<v Speaker 3>and having fun with it.</v>

2345
01:57:19.571 --> 01:57:21.140
<v Speaker 2>There was a funny story that I heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a dea undercovered,</v>

2346
01:57:21.141 --> 01:57:23.130
<v Speaker 2>dea agent who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2347
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:28.190
<v Speaker 2>moved in to try to arrest another </v>
<v Speaker 2>undercovered dea agent and they playing </v>

2348
01:57:28.190 --> 01:57:32.511
<v Speaker 2>each other back and forth against each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and they didn't know that both of </v>

2349
01:57:32.511 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 2>them were cops the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking assholes.</v>

2350
01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Just wasted money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wasted money investigating each </v>

2351
01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking stupid.</v>

2352
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Both sides undercover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2353
01:57:45.451 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2354
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.920
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if trump started talking about that,</v>

2355
01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:51.600
<v Speaker 2>if you really wanted to keep people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

2356
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 2>if you really wanted to get people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the side,</v>

2357
01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I think what he would do is start making</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs legal and started saying,</v>

2358
01:57:56.881 --> 01:58:01.881
<v Speaker 2>listen folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why it's a problem in </v>

2359
01:58:01.881 --> 01:58:03.501
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you talk to real economists </v>

2360
01:58:03.501 --> 01:58:03.501
<v Speaker 2>really were talking about that on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>

2361
01:58:03.501 --> 01:58:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2362
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.810
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is the drug war make </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs legal.</v>

2363
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2364
01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first methods Alpha fucking.</v>

2365
01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a fucking horrible drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruthless.</v>

2366
01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:20.820
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of that in Mexico as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2367
01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a ruthless drug.</v>

2368
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a ruthless drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think part of the reason why it's </v>

2369
01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:28.650
<v Speaker 2>so fucked up is because all of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

2370
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of why it's so fucked </v>

2371
01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:35.070
<v Speaker 2>up is because it's not regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not measured.</v>

2372
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the doses or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say on the box what will kill</v>

2373
01:58:38.701 --> 01:58:39.990
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2374
01:58:39.991 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 2>You can go and bought this old camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiskey at any corner store.</v>

2375
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just go in there and buy it.</v>

2376
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Drake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing,</v>

2377
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 2>drink that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weigh 100 pounds,</v>

2378
01:58:49.061 --> 01:58:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>

2379
01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 2>We all know is thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I did run for mayor,</v>

2380
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I have a.</v>

2381
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:59.870
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a like they have the gun exchange </v>

2382
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.870
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a method change.</v>

2383
01:58:59.870 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Is it Meth for mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2384
01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:04.780
<v Speaker 2>that's a great exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them good drugs.</v>

2385
01:59:04.781 --> 01:59:09.781
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing this because it's cheap </v>

2386
01:59:09.781 --> 01:59:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get get them on good drugs.</v>

2387
01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:15.180
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a really good way to </v>

2388
01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:17.161
<v Speaker 2>approach the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't one of the things that hunter </v>

2389
01:59:17.161 --> 01:59:20.071
<v Speaker 2>s Thompson said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's running for sheriff a Pitkin </v>

2390
01:59:20.071 --> 01:59:20.071
<v Speaker 2>County.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2391
01:59:20.071 --> 01:59:20.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any drug worth taking,</v>

2392
01:59:20.291 --> 01:59:22.750
<v Speaker 2>she'll never be sold and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2393
01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:27.780
<v Speaker 2>put a stocks in the middle of the seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the city to lock up </v>

2394
01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.620
<v Speaker 2>dishonest drug dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drug should be free.</v>

2395
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:34.300
<v Speaker 2>We're going to arrest drug dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if we made everything legal,</v>

2396
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 2>we'd have real problems for sure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a long period of time.</v>

2397
01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:43.050
<v Speaker 2>The question is whether or not you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough resources to parent your kids to </v>

2398
01:59:43.050 --> 01:59:44.500
<v Speaker 2>keep those problems from happening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

2399
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.680
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you have enough self </v>
<v Speaker 2>control to keep yourself from being one </v>

2400
01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 2>of those problems and drugs become legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and accessible,</v>

2401
01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but then once it settled down from there</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

2402
01:59:54.881 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 2>we'd be moving in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier place and you essentially take</v>

2403
01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:00.580
<v Speaker 2>all of the money out of the cartel.</v>

2404
02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:05.580
<v Speaker 2>They're not making any money anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're not going to be this </v>

2405
02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:08.401
<v Speaker 2>murderers gang of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna take a while for things to </v>

2406
02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:08.410
<v Speaker 2>dissipate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look what they did to Columbia.</v>

2407
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia used to be fucking crazy and </v>

2408
02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:14.080
<v Speaker 2>now you can go there and it's supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be really nice.</v>

2409
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:16.720
<v Speaker 2>You go to Bogota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be a really nice place.</v>

2410
02:00:16.721 --> 02:00:17.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's safe.</v>

2411
02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to South America and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

2412
02:00:20.410 --> 02:00:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

2413
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>it's the only continent I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2414
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Antarctica doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2415
02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:31.180
<v Speaker 2>if there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never found a place that looks like</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking rebel army shit going on and </v>

2432

<v Speaker 2>kid and some dude offered me coke.</v>

2438
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I was walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding hands with a five year old dude</v>

2445
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2446
02:01:55.461 --> 02:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2447
02:01:56.361 --> 02:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2448
02:01:58.330 --> 02:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we drove to a couple of different places</v>

2449
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:06.161
<v Speaker 1>in Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you fly into San Jose or </v>

2450
02:02:06.161 --> 02:02:06.161
<v Speaker 1>Liberia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberia.</v>

2451
02:02:06.161 --> 02:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we went to the rain forest.</v>

2452
02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Did the ziplining did I heard a horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2453
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just the honeymoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple of Tan.</v>

2454
02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crashed into each other and killed </v>

2455
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.321
<v Speaker 1>the guy and put the girl in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crashed into each other on a zip </v>

2456
02:02:23.321 --> 02:02:23.321
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2457
02:02:23.321 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>So the one of them get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2458
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.520
<v Speaker 1>and the other guys coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like a fat kid into </v>

2459
02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking a water slide gets stuck in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tube,</v>

2460
02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:38.441
<v Speaker 1>but then the next one comes down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smashes and they were going so fast to </v>

2461
02:02:38.441 --> 02:02:38.441
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

2462
02:02:38.441 --> 02:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the zip line.</v>

2463
02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2464
02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I did that once just to say I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something the first time I went to Costa</v>

2465
02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2466
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

2467
02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fat on a Boogie Board.</v>

2468
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it once too and I kept thinking,</v>

2469
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>when do they check this wire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wire as a mile long,</v>

2470
02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:01.730
<v Speaker 1>how are they checking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wire is not as strong.</v>

2471
02:03:01.731 --> 02:03:06.731
<v Speaker 1>Work Ethic and Costa Rica either know </v>
<v Speaker 1>those dudes who worked there who were </v>

2472
02:03:06.731 --> 02:03:11.631
<v Speaker 1>just climbing up and hitch and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto those things like they're a little </v>

2473
02:03:11.631 --> 02:03:15.821
<v Speaker 1>too comfortable with the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are just a little too </v>

2474
02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:19.100
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with hanging off the trees </v>
<v Speaker 1>clip and ropes on the wires and shooting</v>

2475
02:03:19.101 --> 02:03:23.870
<v Speaker 1>it down a little too casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little too casual about that endeavor.</v>

2476
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the scariest things I've ever </v>

2477
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:32.621
<v Speaker 1>done is the cab ride from Hako to San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jose in the capital and they're fucking </v>

2478
02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 1>speeding around what should be like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile an hour curves and there's a,</v>

2479
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ox and a cart in the fucking middle </v>

2480
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>of the road and you just had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collegiate coming down.</v>

2481
02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be fascinated by bourdain's show </v>

2482
02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 1>was his willingness to continue to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these places where you had to take these</v>

2483
02:03:55.100 --> 02:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>trucks down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dirt roads and you look out the </v>

2484
02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:00.320
<v Speaker 1>window and you see a sheer cliff and up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

2485
02:04:00.321 --> 02:04:05.321
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they get to bring in a tractor to </v>

2486
02:04:05.321 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>move the rocks away for landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2487
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Vietnam where you're,</v>

2488
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the cab from the airport and </v>

2489
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:17.831
<v Speaker 1>there's just see like a Sturgis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese people.</v>

2490
02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>They're all on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sea of motorcycles and scooters.</v>

2491
02:04:22.670 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're literally moving in your seat,</v>

2492
02:04:27.621 --> 02:04:31.280
<v Speaker 1>like they're going to hit it and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

2493
02:04:31.281 --> 02:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Like Cirque de Solei that crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't crash it.</v>

2494
02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Those birds in the sky moved together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2495
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:40.950
<v Speaker 4>That's how they figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How to all of them to get together.</v>

2496
02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Look at all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2497
02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:50.050
<v Speaker 4>This is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just straight and Saturday.</v>

2498
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Three lights or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing there.</v>

2499
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Cars are just driving through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been in Mexico City?</v>

2500
02:04:55.450 --> 02:05:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Might even be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be the view from where I was </v>

2501
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:03.821
<v Speaker 3>staying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was staying in the hotel where they </v>

2502
02:05:04.061 --> 02:05:06.230
<v Speaker 3>have the iconic picture of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2503
02:05:06.590 --> 02:05:08.750
<v Speaker 3>the last helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIA,</v>

2504
02:05:08.751 --> 02:05:13.751
<v Speaker 3>helicopter landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking off from the roof of the hotel </v>

2505
02:05:13.751 --> 02:05:17.861
<v Speaker 3>and people are like climbing to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last person on there.</v>

2506
02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:20.930
<v Speaker 3>That was the hotel we were at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2507
02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Where that helicopter was landing is now</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rooftop bar.</v>

2508
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the hotel we did the Gig in</v>

2509
02:05:28.610 --> 02:05:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to be awesome.</v>

2510
02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:33.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're adventurous,</v>

2511
02:05:33.621 --> 02:05:36.550
<v Speaker 3>if you're Tom Rhodes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's fantastic if you're,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2529
02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I love when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2530
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:21.500
<v Speaker 3>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you complain about something and </v>

<v Speaker 3>Obama did the same thing and no one </v>

2533
02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:25.811
<v Speaker 3>shedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>

2534
02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:25.811
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2535
02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:27.190

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2536
02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.200
<v Speaker 3>that's not the point still sucks you </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you make a point about an issue </v>

2537
02:06:33.051 --> 02:06:38.051
<v Speaker 3>that it's a left or right thing while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were actually defending a person or </v>

2538
02:06:38.971 --> 02:06:40.220
<v Speaker 3>a like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is fucked up and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will Obama did it?</v>

2540
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still fucked up and wrong.</v>

2541
02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:46.400
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2542
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I think Obama's a really fucking cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy as a personality,</v>

2543
02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:53.160
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure every print.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2544
02:06:53.210 --> 02:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton did horrible fucking things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Yo,</v>

2545
02:06:56.901 --> 02:07:01.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like increased sentencing from fucking </v>

2546
02:07:01.901 --> 02:07:01.901
<v Speaker 3>drug stuff and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2547
02:07:01.901 --> 02:07:03.950
<v Speaker 3>but he was a good personality and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give a fuck.</v>

2548
02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't imagine</v>

2549
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:12.010
<v Speaker 4>a guy or girl that's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to every single issue </v>

2550
02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:16.511
<v Speaker 4>that's going on in this country and </v>
<v Speaker 4>making decisions about all of it and </v>

2551
02:07:16.511 --> 02:07:19.541
<v Speaker 4>doing it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>investigating every single issue </v>

2552
02:07:19.541 --> 02:07:22.331
<v Speaker 4>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting all the right advice from all </v>

2553
02:07:22.331 --> 02:07:25.280
<v Speaker 4>the advisors carefully considering each </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every step the fuck out of here.</v>

2554
02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:30.400
<v Speaker 4>There's no way they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way the president really </v>

2555
02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:31.370
<v Speaker 4>knows what's going on with all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different problems in this country.</v>

2556
02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:32.420
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking way</v>

2557
02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:37.660
<v Speaker 3>possible if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we just became a,</v>

2558
02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 3>a cool country like Norway and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>close all the bases around the world.</v>

2559
02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:51.541
<v Speaker 3>Don't be world police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just gonna be a fun country like </v>

2560
02:07:51.541 --> 02:07:54.871
<v Speaker 3>fucking Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just bring all the troops back and no </v>

2561
02:07:54.871 --> 02:07:58.351
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead with the were disarming you </v>

2562
02:07:58.391 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think shit would calm down.</v>

2563
02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I think the world would calm down</v>

2564
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:10.280
<v Speaker 4>as long as we kept our guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as they keep our weapons and </v>

2565
02:08:11.671 --> 02:08:13.620
<v Speaker 4>keep the same amount of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>military,</v>

2566
02:08:13.621 --> 02:08:18.621
<v Speaker 4>bring them back home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but make them exercise here at the </v>

2567
02:08:18.621 --> 02:08:22.080
<v Speaker 4>problem is as soon as any one superpower</v>
<v Speaker 4>drifts away,</v>

2568
02:08:22.081 --> 02:08:25.230
<v Speaker 4>they leave a vacuum and another super </v>
<v Speaker 4>power try to rise up.</v>

2569
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:30.800
<v Speaker 4>That's the big fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the big military proponents </v>

2570
02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.040
<v Speaker 4>fear is that if we're not strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else will become stronger and </v>

2571
02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.410
<v Speaker 4>then we'll be weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be attacked and that it does happen</v>

2572
02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:41.440
<v Speaker 4>other places in the world and we can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be so naive as to think it'll never </v>

2573
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:41.440
<v Speaker 4>happen again.</v>

2574
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>So give it a shot and if it doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2575
02:08:43.551 --> 02:08:48.551
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you can take any </v>

2576
02:08:49.431 --> 02:08:54.431
<v Speaker 3>president seriously now as we're aging </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put time and perspective for years </v>

2586
02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.890
<v Speaker 4>question in the United States was </v>
<v Speaker 4>founded because people have decided they</v>

2587
02:09:24.891 --> 02:09:26.720
<v Speaker 4>didn't like the way things are running </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Europe.</v>

2588
02:09:26.721 --> 02:09:29.690
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like monarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like being under the rule of</v>

2589
02:09:29.691 --> 02:09:34.691
<v Speaker 4>the king or queen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to do it by elected </v>

2590
02:09:34.691 --> 02:09:36.971
<v Speaker 4>officials that wanted to have a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Great calves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>

2628
02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boring white people.</v>

2629
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:19.250
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the good things about what</v>

2630
02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you do is that you can be in your town </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can go other places,</v>

2631
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:27.260
<v Speaker 1>but you always have that town versus if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get stuck.</v>

2632
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just living in Columbus,</v>

2633
02:11:29.901 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole life.</v>

2634
02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Not to pick on Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but near St Louis,</v>

2635
02:11:33.021 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever name is city versus someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>travels around all over the place.</v>

2636
02:11:37.611 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 1>The same can be said about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in La.</v>

2637
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.800
<v Speaker 1>If you grow up here and you think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the world of this,</v>

2638
02:11:42.801 --> 02:11:47.801
<v Speaker 1>this crazy congested slab of human rose </v>
<v Speaker 1>piled on top of each other.</v>

2639
02:11:49.770 --> 02:11:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Now the rest of the world is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some spots where you can go to </v>

2640
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.890
<v Speaker 1>where there's hardly anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been to Idaho?</v>

2641
02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Boise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>

2642
02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2643
02:11:57.561 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I lived in a town of 400 people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Awhile when I was 22.</v>

2644
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.930
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2645
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 1>a little cabin on the south fork of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>payette river,</v>

2646
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>about 55 miles north of Boise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some lakes up there where you </v>

2647
02:12:11.841 --> 02:12:13.730
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even be allowed to be here.</v>

2648
02:12:14.230 --> 02:12:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is too pretty,</v>

2649
02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>like this seems like you should have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay to be here or this should be </v>

2650
02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>restricted access or something.</v>

2651
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fucking gorgeous up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2652
02:12:24.010 --> 02:12:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 22 and I,</v>

2653
02:12:26.690 --> 02:12:29.600
<v Speaker 1>my wife left me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Boise just because it sounded</v>

2654
02:12:29.601 --> 02:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fraud,</v>

2655
02:12:32.271 --> 02:12:34.160
<v Speaker 1>telemarketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could do it anywhere.</v>

2656
02:12:34.161 --> 02:12:35.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2657
02:12:35.371 --> 02:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

2658
02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.990
<v Speaker 1>after we moved to Boise and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife left me for my best friend.</v>

2659
02:12:41.991 --> 02:12:46.991
<v Speaker 1>We all moved out there together and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>my other buddy that moved with us </v>

2660
02:12:46.991 --> 02:12:49.190
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle the stress so he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Vegas.</v>

2661
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:53.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm all my shit to boise and within </v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks I'm alone.</v>

2662
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So I moved up to this fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a cabin,</v>

2663
02:12:56.661 --> 02:13:01.050
<v Speaker 1>like a for sale by owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2664
02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't get a loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2665
02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to give you was,</v>

2666
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just signed a contract and I'll </v>

2667
02:13:10.821 --> 02:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go through a bank owner,</v>

2668
02:13:13.250 --> 02:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>financed owner finance and a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabin and the two bars in town.</v>

2669
02:13:19.761 --> 02:13:24.761
<v Speaker 1>And you were either a long branch guy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the dirty shame guy and I was a </v>

2670
02:13:24.761 --> 02:13:29.141
<v Speaker 1>dirty shame saloon guy and I would drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth because in a small town </v>

2671
02:13:29.421 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>they open around noon but</v>

2672
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.920
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily at Niu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how old were you then?</v>

2673
02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2674
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:41.570
<v Speaker 3>No fucking chicks there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would drive back and forth in </v>

2675
02:13:41.570 --> 02:13:43.860
<v Speaker 3>front of the bar until Jolie showed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to open.</v>

2676
02:13:43.861 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's 1215.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been just driving back and forth,</v>

2677
02:13:47.821 --> 02:13:52.821
<v Speaker 3>waiting for it to open and I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lasted like six months and then I had </v>

2678
02:13:52.821 --> 02:13:54.320
<v Speaker 3>to ditch out on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You there by yourself?</v>

2679
02:13:54.321 --> 02:13:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Owner financing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2680
02:13:55.831 --> 02:14:00.831
<v Speaker 3>at one point my buddy that moved back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas came up and he was there for a </v>

2681
02:14:00.831 --> 02:14:03.600
<v Speaker 3>couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'd get on the phone just enough to</v>

2682
02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.940
<v Speaker 3>pay our bar tab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2683
02:14:05.941 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 3>my bar tab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I traded out like furniture when I.</v>

2684
02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:14.540
<v Speaker 3>When I bailed six months later I traded </v>
<v Speaker 3>jolene like my furniture in the cabin </v>

2685
02:14:14.881 --> 02:14:17.580
<v Speaker 3>for my bar tab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

2686
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:22.780
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could set your own hours when </v>

2687
02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:22.780
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that.</v>

2688
02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Telemarketing stuff,</v>

2689
02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 3>he just did it whenever you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just got you clocked in.</v>

2690
02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 3>You got paid out of my cabin was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up the phone.</v>

2691
02:14:30.841 --> 02:14:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I had leads I stole from Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2692
02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 3>and what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did that work?</v>

2693
02:14:36.930 --> 02:14:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I'd call up businesses and then add the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch and you won one of these awards </v>

2694
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:46.341
<v Speaker 3>and you just have to buy this many pens </v>
<v Speaker 3>like ad copy and ad specs,</v>

2695
02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.340
<v Speaker 3>advertising specialties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This mug with A.</v>

2696
02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Hey Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2697
02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:54.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won a big award and I'm going to.</v>

2698
02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is make a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>purchase of these mugs with your </v>

2699
02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:01.080
<v Speaker 3>business name on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Joe Rogan podcast,</v>

2700
02:15:01.081 --> 02:15:02.880
<v Speaker 3>and you're guaranteed to win this big </v>
<v Speaker 3>award.</v>

2701
02:15:02.881 --> 02:15:05.580
<v Speaker 3>That's worth way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2702
02:15:05.581 --> 02:15:07.680
<v Speaker 3>So it was just a total scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2703
02:15:08.070 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But cleverly phrased,</v>

2704
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:16.320
<v Speaker 3>so to stay in that gray area of legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

2705
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:17.910
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a dude who has</v>

2706
02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:23.220
<v Speaker 2>really interesting scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a scam where they were making a.</v>

2707
02:15:24.150 --> 02:15:28.500
<v Speaker 2>It was a company that would allow you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix your credit.</v>

2708
02:15:28.710 --> 02:15:32.700
<v Speaker 2>So they would give you a line of credit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a,</v>

2709
02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you would buy things and then pay off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the credit and it would boost your </v>

2710
02:15:38.341 --> 02:15:40.140
<v Speaker 2>credit backs if you had fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

2711
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.390
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was allowing you to fix your credit.</v>

2712
02:15:42.391 --> 02:15:46.410
<v Speaker 2>But the catch was the only things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could buy with their credit card was</v>

2713
02:15:46.411 --> 02:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>things from their catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2714
02:15:48.670 --> 02:15:51.490
<v Speaker 3>a soul to the company's story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2715
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:52.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

2716
02:15:52.610 --> 02:15:54.360
<v Speaker 3>So they had these catalogs scam</v>

2717
02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:59.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but say if something costs,</v>

2718
02:15:59.040 --> 02:15:59.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2719
02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a toenail clipper for costs like $3 at </v>

2720
02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:07.511
<v Speaker 2>the grocery store there is $25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to buy it,</v>

2721
02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2722
02:16:08.241 --> 02:16:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you're giving them a giant chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

2723
02:16:10.730 --> 02:16:15.730
<v Speaker 2>So they would ship these terrible little</v>
<v Speaker 2>items and it would really actually boost</v>

2724
02:16:16.081 --> 02:16:18.470
<v Speaker 2>these people's credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually did work were.</v>

2725
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:21.170
<v Speaker 2>So it was enough that it was a total </v>
<v Speaker 2>scam.</v>

2726
02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So you're the only shit they can buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your credit cards and stuff from </v>

2727
02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:28.130
<v Speaker 2>your catalog and everything's marked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the fucking roof.</v>

2728
02:16:28.610 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 2>And this made millions</v>

2729
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:31.910
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made millions.</v>

2730
02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:37.380
<v Speaker 3>What aspects of the products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I was working for a company </v>

2731
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:40.520
<v Speaker 3>originally we would have the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2732
02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.800
<v Speaker 3>a black mat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pen with the gold medal Florentine </v>

2733
02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Trim and five lines of your ad copy on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and we'd be selling these fucking </v>

2734
02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 3>twenty five cent pens for like $4 a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>

2735
02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.880
<v Speaker 3>So it was put the scan that I was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into when I started doing comedy</v>

2736
02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:05.110
<v Speaker 3>and then bailed out and went full time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And comedy was the uh,</v>

2737
02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:07.390
<v Speaker 3>the invention once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the George Foreman.</v>

2738
02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh look the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2739
02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you have an invention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a fucking.</v>

2740
02:17:13.430 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a great scam because egos</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved and it's good.</v>

2741

2782
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:41.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a throwaway special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just did it like as an experiment </v>

2783
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:45.310
<v Speaker 3>in the fun house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically this room but not maybe not</v>

<v Speaker 3>quite this big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an 18 by 20 box with a bar built </v>

2785
02:19:51.551 --> 02:19:54.290
<v Speaker 3>and a little tiny stage in the corner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've filmed.</v>

2786
02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a pop off vodka presents and </v>
<v Speaker 3>evening would tug stan hope and now </v>

2787
02:19:59.530 --> 02:20:01.640
<v Speaker 3>we're selling it on vhs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we're sold out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2791
02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I took about an hour's worth of material</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

2792
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I think there's only 20 minutes on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vhs,</v>

2793
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:19.090
<v Speaker 3>just the bit about pop up vodka presents</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we tried to get sponsorship with </v>

2794
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:24.560
<v Speaker 3>pop off because it's fucking low grade </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty vodka and I thought that would be</v>

2795
02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:29.800
<v Speaker 3>a funny sponsor and Brian reached out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and through channels that they said the </v>

2796
02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:35.580
<v Speaker 3>pop off wouldn't touch doug stanhope </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a 10 foot pole as what they said.</v>

2797
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:41.170
<v Speaker 3>So I have this giant 20 minute fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit about it and I like I'm going to be </v>

2798
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:46.631

2801
02:20:55.791 --> 02:20:58.640
<v Speaker 3>cut out of other specials where I go.</v>

2851
02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad idea.</v>

2852
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could do youtube red to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it through subscriptions.</v>

2853
02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it now.</v>

2854
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:58.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more options every day.</v>

2855
02:23:58.951 --> 02:23:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2856
02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:01.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's becoming interesting.</v>

2857
02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon releases a lot of stuff now too.</v>

2858
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.080
<v Speaker 1>They're releasing a lot of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2859
02:24:07.081 --> 02:24:09.540
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of amazed since there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only one youtube.</v>

2860
02:24:09.690 --> 02:24:10.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2861
02:24:10.921 --> 02:24:15.921
<v Speaker 1>Vimeo does exist and it is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of like when people think </v>

2862
02:24:15.921 --> 02:24:19.500
<v Speaker 1>of like one platform where you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on,</v>

2863
02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:22.360
<v Speaker 1>he really only think of Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:24:22.370 --> 02:24:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and monetizing.</v>

2865
02:24:24.091 --> 02:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how any of that works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie could tell you I can help you.</v>

2866
02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2867
02:24:33.241 --> 02:24:38.241
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do it and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fucking start doing video for </v>

2868
02:24:38.671 --> 02:24:40.230
<v Speaker 1>our podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2869
02:24:40.231 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 1>How come you don't like doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hate being on camera.</v>

2870
02:24:43.171 --> 02:24:48.171
<v Speaker 1>Like here you have it subtle enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that your old studio where </v>

2871
02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at my face on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start remembering the tripping that </v>

2872
02:24:54.090 --> 02:24:56.220
<v Speaker 1>bad bad day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2873
02:24:56.340 --> 02:25:01.340
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have done that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way was dumb because when we </v>

2874
02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:02.970
<v Speaker 1>realized somewhere along the line that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were up on that screen,</v>

2875
02:25:02.971 --> 02:25:04.920
<v Speaker 1>like we would look at ourselves on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

2876
02:25:04.921 --> 02:25:09.921
<v Speaker 1>It would make you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somewhere along the line I </v>

2877
02:25:09.921 --> 02:25:09.921
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stop doing this.</v>

2878
02:25:09.921 --> 02:25:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just doesn't seem like it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of Gopros.</v>

2879
02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2880
02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's an added unnecessary element </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about.</v>

2881
02:25:16.890 --> 02:25:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about that camera or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

2882
02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:20.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2883
02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:24.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember the first time I did your</v>

2884
02:25:24.730 --> 02:25:29.730
<v Speaker 1>podcast and we were sitting on a couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're side by side,</v>

2885
02:25:30.671 --> 02:25:35.671
<v Speaker 1>so it's awkward and it was uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>couches or uncomfortable to like sit and</v>

2886
02:25:36.311 --> 02:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sit up and talk like you're sinking</v>

2887
02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:41.620
<v Speaker 1>into him and it just starts bothering </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2888
02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:43.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to look across someone you </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

2889
02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be nine years in </v>

2890
02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:49.320
<v Speaker 1>December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at you</v>

2892
02:25:54.350 --> 02:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2893
02:25:57.051 --> 02:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>That couch was in [inaudible] house for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still have to make me hard sign.</v>

2894
02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 1>That was offensive to offensive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy central are you're doing.</v>

2896
02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So you're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>House is like,</v>

2897
02:26:09.971 --> 02:26:14.971
<v Speaker 1>you have an extra house so you have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your main house where you live in and </v>

2898
02:26:14.971 --> 02:26:18.451
<v Speaker 1>then you have the fun house that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and we have a guest house and you </v>

2899
02:26:18.451 --> 02:26:20.290
<v Speaker 1>bought a couple houses in town too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2900
02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2901
02:26:22.451 --> 02:26:23.930
<v Speaker 1>We get a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be,</v>

2902
02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you're becoming your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2903
02:26:26.170 --> 02:26:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Oregon cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just slowly buy up the town.</v>

2904
02:26:29.470 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Start renting it out to people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2905
02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:37.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what the free state project </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that the Libertarian Movement </v>

2906
02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.791
<v Speaker 1>to try to get everyone to move to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and that way we can all vote </v>

2907
02:26:41.791 --> 02:26:43.990
<v Speaker 1>because we get one percent of the vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationally,</v>

2908
02:26:43.991 --> 02:26:45.820
<v Speaker 1>but if we all lived in one state than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

2909
02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they picked New Hampshire.</v>

2910
02:26:48.281 --> 02:26:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fucking fuck you.</v>

2911
02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just too hard to get laid up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking cold.</v>

2912
02:26:56.100 --> 02:27:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's too cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen winter and many years.</v>

2913
02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember a Fitzsimmons got kicked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a Gig up there and they had told him </v>

2914
02:27:05.410 --> 02:27:08.350
<v Speaker 1>not to drive at night because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many moose on the road.</v>

2915
02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kicked them out of the Gig for </v>

2916
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They filed.</v>

2917
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>They fired him when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he got there,</v>

2918
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:16.960
<v Speaker 1>they had his bags packed when he got off</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and they said,</v>

2919
02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:21.961
<v Speaker 1>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out because you're supposed to be </v>

2920
02:27:21.961 --> 02:27:21.961
<v Speaker 1>there for the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they made them drive home.</v>

2921
02:27:21.961 --> 02:27:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing this is a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2922
02:27:24.041 --> 02:27:27.370
<v Speaker 1>We were both starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Fitzsimmons is a hothead.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always been.</v>

2926

<v Speaker 1>He's always been a hothead as long as </v>

2927
02:27:37.441 --> 02:27:39.961
<v Speaker 1>I've done a podcast a few years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he almost came to fisticuffs with a </v>

2928
02:27:40.331 --> 02:27:41.650

<v Speaker 1>guy just ignored me.</v>

2933
02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:55.981
<v Speaker 1>He was so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just waiting there to do his </v>

2936

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we get on the podcast and he's </v>

2937
02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:07.700
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professional.</v>

2938
02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

2939
02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:12.190
<v Speaker 1>We started out together like within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week apart from each other.</v>

2940
02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2941
02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>we're buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're raw open micros.</v>

2942
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:20.640
<v Speaker 1>We steal jokes from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we didn't really have enough </v>

2943
02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 1>material to do like a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he would do some</v>

2944
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:27.100
<v Speaker 2>of my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do some of his shit and he would tell </v>

2945
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:27.100
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2946
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:30.160
<v Speaker 2>that blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It worked great and fucking some shit </v>

2947
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:30.980
<v Speaker 2>hole in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you,</v>

2948
02:28:30.981 --> 02:28:35.981
<v Speaker 2>when we were like a year and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>both about a year and when we started </v>

2949
02:28:35.981 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 2>getting paid gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're a year and you've really</v>

2950
02:28:38.001 --> 02:28:39.540
<v Speaker 2>don't have shit.</v>

2951
02:28:40.410 --> 02:28:45.410
<v Speaker 3>My first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first right before I moved to </v>

2952
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:48.111
<v Speaker 3>Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first paid road Gig was in flagstaff </v>

2953
02:28:48.111 --> 02:28:51.681
<v Speaker 3>for Sandy Hackett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was co headlining with a </v>

2954
02:28:51.681 --> 02:28:53.220
<v Speaker 3>ventriloquist who'd never worked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy club.</v>

2955
02:28:53.221 --> 02:28:55.200
<v Speaker 3>He only worked at the county fair </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuits.</v>

2956
02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:58.440
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember he was so weird.</v>

2957
02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:03.990
<v Speaker 3>He was an old historic hotel that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were staying in that they put us up in.</v>

2958
02:29:03.991 --> 02:29:08.910
<v Speaker 3>The gig is in and he moved to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different hotel because this was so old.</v>

2959
02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:14.060
<v Speaker 3>He thought it was a fire hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said one time he played a cruise </v>

2960
02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:19.041
<v Speaker 3>ship and someone threw his dummy </v>
<v Speaker 3>overboard and he can't go through that </v>

2961
02:29:19.041 --> 02:29:23.301
<v Speaker 3>again if he lost this dummy in a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he paid probably as much as he was </v>

2962
02:29:23.730 --> 02:29:27.270
<v Speaker 3>making for the Gig to get his own hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a decent hotel.</v>

2963

02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't started in 28 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to interact with you.</v>

3043
02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:40.080
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with you.</v>

3044
02:33:40.081 --> 02:33:42.150
<v Speaker 1>If they wanted us to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to ask you.</v>

3046
02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:45.740
<v Speaker 1>They got to go to open mic nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask the guide.</v>

3047
02:33:45.741 --> 02:33:48.610
<v Speaker 1>That's if you haven't done an open mic </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

<v Speaker 1>where do I do?</v>

3049
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:57.230

<v Speaker 1>to get work as an mc than asking him see</v>

3050
02:33:58.230 --> 02:34:03.230
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked the guy just above you because </v>

3051
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:06.051
<v Speaker 1>he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck you think I </v>

3052
02:34:06.051 --> 02:34:06.840
<v Speaker 1>know what the Dorfman's look for in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It means people that want advice,</v>

3060
02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:33.340
<v Speaker 1>like there's no way you can give an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice anyway.</v>

3061
02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:35.500
<v Speaker 1>You would have to see them a whole bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>

3062
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And even then you'd have to be like,</v>

02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're asking me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't listen to me.</v>

3083
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:25.000

<v Speaker 1>My refrain.</v>

3084
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Joey Zola was a guy that was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little above me and I was given advice </v>

3085
02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:33.880
<v Speaker 1>to a kid that was just below me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at know,</v>

02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:37.780
<v Speaker 1>just above open miker and Jelly pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>me aside.</v>

3087
02:35:37.781 --> 02:35:40.300
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give these kids advice because all</v>

3088
02:35:40.301 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you ever doing is telling them how to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3089
02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3090
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:45.310
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

3091
02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I would have fucking told Dane Cook.</v>

3092
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to.</v>

3093
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to be good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not your audience.</v>

3094
02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy is always going to suffer from </v>

3095
02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that because there's no categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3096
02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a blues or.</v>

3097
02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>different ways doing,</v>

3101
02:36:11.050 --> 02:36:14.860
<v Speaker 1>but there's no categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they used to build me as x rated just</v>

3102
02:36:14.861 --> 02:36:17.980
<v Speaker 1>because there wasn't a category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to warn people.</v>

3103
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:22.810
<v Speaker 1>The signs that I still have on all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows to this day,</v>

3104

<v Speaker 4>Then you try to take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're barely sleep.</v>

3195
02:40:53.001 --> 02:40:55.340
<v Speaker 4>You sleep a few hours at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to get up in the morning again.</v>

3196
02:40:55.670 --> 02:41:00.670
<v Speaker 4>You're doing a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're wired after the show and then </v>

3197
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.670
<v Speaker 4>they're like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three days in your exhaust it,</v>

3198
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:02.090
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3199
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:07.990
<v Speaker 4>I think the way to do it is to spread it</v>
<v Speaker 4>out over long periods of time so that </v>

3200
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:10.670
<v Speaker 4>you do a Gig and then you hang out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the city for like a few days,</v>

3201
02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:12.860
<v Speaker 4>chill out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see what's there,</v>

3202
02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:14.300
<v Speaker 4>then move onto the next place.</v>

3203
02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:17.770
<v Speaker 3>I I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

3204
02:41:17.771 --> 02:41:21.390
<v Speaker 3>let's get it out of the way because </v>
<v Speaker 3>those days off I go,</v>

3205
02:41:21.610 --> 02:41:23.470
<v Speaker 3>oh wow.</v>

3208
02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lot healthier when I have a lot of</v>

3209
02:41:31.961 --> 02:41:36.340
<v Speaker 3>gigs in a row because then I stay sober </v>
<v Speaker 3>until show time.</v>

3210
02:41:36.370 --> 02:41:38.020
<v Speaker 3>You tried quitting cigarettes for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while?</v>

3213
