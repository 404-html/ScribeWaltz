00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

19
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless they,</v>

20
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I started on the Sopranos in 99.</v>

21
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I went back and forth for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The judge did six episodes.</v>

23
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I was still at the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like the how?</v>

24
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It must've been fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was still at the river.</v>

25
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Then I booked it for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

26
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I booked the river till 2010.</v>

27
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock said you're still dipping</v>
<v Speaker 1>your toe in that shit.</v>

28
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

29
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>They're paying me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

30
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it to book three comics a week?</v>

31
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I could do it in three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Book up six months.</v>

32
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the book I book guys that,</v>

33
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work much,</v>

34
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think your point is a really</v>

35
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>important part of what you're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the getting a different perspective</v>

36
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>or a guy like Kendall feeney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd imagine he was so good.</v>

38
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You would imagine that he probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at it from all sorts of different</v>

39
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes he did.</v>

40
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And you saw a lot of different colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

41
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would work 16 hours.</v>

42
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen hour days on the Sopranos.</v>

43
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>He's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's there.</v>

44
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>So I mean the guy gets up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever time he got up,</v>

45
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>then he's got to go home and learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow stuff.</v>

46
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes he told me he'd be sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the chair.</v>

47
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>He Fall Asleep for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wakes up,</v>

48
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>she's still there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just waiting for him to wake up and</v>

49
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>they're going to work on the stuff for</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

50
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

52
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.220

60
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a full hour,</v>

61
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>18 working days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine Brock was said to me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're talking about Gandolfini.</v>

94
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>that's still fucking with my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>

95
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Jim was one of my closest friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find a better guy.</v>

96
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>He worked hardly stories.</v>

<v Speaker 1>while he was on the Sopranos.</v>

101
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>But it was like no life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could completely gave up your life,</v>

102
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>not the rest of us because there was so</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a point with the money now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>what I love about blue bloods is there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of character.</v>

122
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.810

135
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first got the role,</v>

136
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I was seeing all these jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're counseling with legs and you</v>

137
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.501

<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going,</v>

139
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that much fatter than getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Fini.</v>

140
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm just starting to think that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they catch the wrong guy.</v>

141
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying P,</v>

142
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean these jokes don't make sense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they call all you got to come in</v>

143
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>for a fat suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was ridiculous thing.</v>

144
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Then the second year they made it like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice one that costs like a</v>

145
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>costume shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had like tits and</v>

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>a costume shop in like a Broadway</v>
<v Speaker 1>costume thing.</v>

147
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one year I was going back and I</v>

148
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>was at a fitting for the fourth year,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

151
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm assuming it was pretty</v>

152

153
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:56.950

<v Speaker 1>And he was gone too big and I was like</v>

154
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.980
<v Speaker 1>going walking back and forth like crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like that acting that way became in</v>

167
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.060
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taste started to taste.</v>

168
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They used to hang around wherever we</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were extras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we were up in Reno and there's one of</v>

<v Speaker 1>he hit Michael and Michael was right.</v>

184
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>He got really pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just one of those fucking</v>

185
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Goombas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This like this.</v>

188
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>There's wannabes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about Guinea</v>

<v Speaker 1>wannabes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a handful out of here.</v>

190
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

191
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>And the thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they congregate together when they try</v>

192
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>to like climb out tying</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

193
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.310

195
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda.</v>

196
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 1>And I try to navigate away from even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

197
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my thing.</v>

198
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And Sopranos was so good that it almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the genre.</v>

199
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I think so I think you're right about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you know what,</v>

200
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>unless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get a lot of scripts,</v>

201
00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know of that crap.</v>

202
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make these,</v>

203
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I call them backyard movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>

206
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It's that same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck you up.</v>

207
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>You know I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:13.950
<v Speaker 1>my uncle is my rarest gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

209
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 1>But they write this and I say how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them the money.</v>

210
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the money to make these</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies?</v>

211
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for awhile people were making</v>

212
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:24.840
<v Speaker 1>them just because it's sopranos was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular now.</v>

213
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're going to beat Sopranos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodfellas,</v>

214
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the great mob movies?</v>

215
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Some Sopranos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodfellas Casino,</v>

216
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>a raging bull had marbella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

217
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

218
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 1>one of my mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going to be a few of them,</v>

219
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some great,</v>

220
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.320
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great mob movies.</v>

221
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But right now it was after the Sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

222
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

223
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.790
<v Speaker 1>The Godfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>godfather to know that there was some,</v>

224
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but you're to have to beat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they tried,</v>

225
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>they tried to do some mobby stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

226
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Donovan's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good trail.</v>

227
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's from an Irish perspective.</v>

228
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened with those movies</v>

229
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.361
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

230
00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>that show rather is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was those,</v>

232
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.180

<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

233
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So like every subject was covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But trail gambling,</v>

234
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was funny,</v>

235
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

250
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.810

<v Speaker 1>Trying to shake me down.</v>

290
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the movie came out,</v>

291
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>we got some heat for the Nicky deuce</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

292
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not really about mob.</v>

293
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It's intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

294
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

295
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>and they did that with the cement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people would say all the time,</v>

296
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:37.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

297
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:38.641
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

298
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to think I'm an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

299
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>You guys talked bad about the times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

300
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

301
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed what really was.</v>

302
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was very authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

303
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>this apprentices is authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a guess.</v>

305
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>If you know anybody like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>those people exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

307
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that fencing?</v>

308
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a story that needs to be</v>

309
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think in stone this is what it</v>

310
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was such a fascinating show</v>

311
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>because Gandel feeney was a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his character.</v>

312
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 1>You're rooted for a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a murder for a murderer or cheated on.</v>

313
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:14.960
<v Speaker 1>His wife stole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rob shook people down slowly,</v>

314
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but he was your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

315
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I think the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could be wrong,</v>

316
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the first like anti hero that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will default to.</v>

317
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine before that it was,</v>

318
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:27.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

319
00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>your roof for the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he was a real anti hero murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a con man.</v>

321
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of the above</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people in the mob.</v>

322
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They did it to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:40.440
<v Speaker 1>like on the show.</v>

324
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.400
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't just within each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went outside,</v>

325
00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:47.460
<v Speaker 1>they were robbing people and busting up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>businesses and doing all this stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

328
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

329
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Show was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very small.</v>

330
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a very smart show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it was,</v>

331
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.750
<v Speaker 1>if they put it back on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get higher ratings than some</v>

332
00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 1>of these shows now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

333
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

334
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.980
<v Speaker 1>it was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people forgot how good</v>

335
00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:08.430
<v Speaker 1>it was and it also changed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the first episode,</v>

336
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:11.040
<v Speaker 1>the first episode was essentially like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>slapstick comedy.</v>

337
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the rain brought out with the</v>

338
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 1>rain Brocco a who was the woman that</v>
<v Speaker 1>played a his wife Edi file community.</v>

339
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Falco and Falco had a fucking machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun and like the doctor was trying to</v>

340
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.900
<v Speaker 1>come down and see that and she's outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a machine gun point matter.</v>

341
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It was way more slapsticky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

342
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It was like a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shot.</v>

343
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Got The show aired in [inaudible] 99,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

344
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.020

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 98,</v>

345
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.090
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

346
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken at 98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe [inaudible] 97 even.</v>

347
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 1>They go back and then it took six months</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they started shooting them.</v>

348
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>You know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how David Chase did it?</v>

349
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.470
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do it like a regular show</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you shoot it and then in three</v>

350
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:00.570
<v Speaker 1>weeks it's on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

351
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.740
<v Speaker 1>he put them all in the can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were finished and locked and you</v>

<v Speaker 1>you got to shoot the scene again with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different actor for whatever reason,</v>

365
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 1>whether you know the guy didn't do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job or a,</v>

366
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 1>he looked too young or too old or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't fit.</v>

370
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about those kinds of</v>
