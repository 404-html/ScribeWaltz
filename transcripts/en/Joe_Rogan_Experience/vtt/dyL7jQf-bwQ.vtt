00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience when I started doing nights or doing yoga when I travel</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and I feel better,</v>

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel a lot better doing that.</v>

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>That's because all the girls that yoga pants in the class,</v>

5
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel better too.</v>

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.861
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it,</v>

7
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>is she excited?</v>

8
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing.</v>

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.333
<v Speaker 1>No Yoga.</v>

10
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>That was the pig.</v>

11
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I could just go to the yoga pants.</v>

12
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

13
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>You can just go to a strip club and you feel great.</v>

15
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.781

18
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.840

19
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I played Largo the other night and there's a place across from it.</v>

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>different reasons to go to strip clubs a lot.</v>

64
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.891
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

65

<v Speaker 1>it turned me off.</v>

66
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I was in Nashville once,</v>

67
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I saw a commercial on TV for a strip club.</v>

68
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

69
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I would like,</v>

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.411

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

80
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't want you to know.</v>

81
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You're like the anonymity of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cause I really want to go.</v>

100
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>The California thing is whenever,</v>

101
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know someone's come from California because in the first 30 seconds they</v>

102
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>tell you something incredibly intimate,</v>

103
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>intimate about their life.</v>

104
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

105
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

106
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I used to be addicted to drugs or like I was molested and I'm like,</v>

107
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're here.</v>

108
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Dog burdened me with this shit.</v>

109
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know that.</v>

110
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's sad,</v>

111
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's why they're here.</v>

112
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You know it's weird because this is also the,</v>

114
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously people create all over the world,</v>

115
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>

116
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>But when you come to like creating things that get attention,</v>

117
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>this is like the pub of the universe creating things that get attention.</v>

118
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's almost all in Hollywood.</v>

119
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big chunk of it,</v>

120
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:07.931
<v Speaker 1>whether it's movies,</v>

121
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.764
<v Speaker 1>TV shows,</v>

122
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.101
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

123
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.341
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

124
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:09.581
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

125
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

126
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Who needs attention?</v>

127
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>People that didn't get enough or people that got too much of the wrong con and</v>

128
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that seek out and seek out validation.</v>

129
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.511
<v Speaker 1>So they all come here.</v>

130
00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

131
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Mathematical process.</v>

132
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

134
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe he always left her.</v>

135
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole blonde bombshell just put fucking billboards of herself and came</v>

136
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>famous just for that.</v>

137
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I saw her the other day just picking her nose and eating it and then you posted</v>

138
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:30.421
<v Speaker 2>something about,</v>

139
00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>you saw somebody picking your nose and eating it like the day after and I'm</v>

140

00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

142
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

143
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I love that pink corvette around</v>

144
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 1>a wig.</v>

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.130
<v Speaker 1>She was a on the PCH,</v>

146
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>the Topanga to the pcs on the merge were stopped at the light and I look behind</v>

147
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and I watched this old lady in a wig just dig,</v>

148
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.751
<v Speaker 1>pull out,</v>

149
00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll whopper and just start chewing.</v>

150
00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:50.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

151
00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>she was openly chill enough mouth open chewing,</v>

152
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

153
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.943
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

154
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And all I could think of,</v>

155
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 1>of course for the rest of the day it was that she probably came over here in</v>

156
00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:04.901
<v Speaker 1>1955 and she wanted to be a star and she was hot and it just didn't work out.</v>

157
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And now she's wearing a wig on the PCH chewing or burgers in her blue Saturn</v>

158
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:11.690
<v Speaker 1>with fucking faded out paint.</v>

159
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a very weird watch as I thought it was.</v>

160
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought she always drove a vet.</v>

161
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Now that's Angelina [inaudible].</v>

162
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.901
<v Speaker 1>Angelina,</v>

163
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I saw some random crazy lady was light blue Saturn.</v>

164
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.041
<v Speaker 1>I do that with people.</v>

165
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I like try to piece together what their story was,</v>

166
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

167
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.590
<v Speaker 1>what's it?</v>

168
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>That fucking mind always goes down to drugs and blow jobs.</v>

169
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>The story's all there.</v>

170
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Very unoriginal.</v>

171
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.251
<v Speaker 1>They always,</v>

172
00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:31.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line someone blew Burt Reynolds.</v>

174
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>That's always in my stories.</v>

175
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan would show up at a place in 2000 women would show up to meet him</v>

176
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:41.564
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

177
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 1>7,000 women would get the text message,</v>

178
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jr.</v>

179
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

180
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the pussy that has been thrown at Michael Jordan.</v>

181
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.983

182
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you can't even wrap your head around.</v>

183
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

185
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like locusts</v>

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 2>And he's actually won suits and he keeps winning.</v>

192
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm winning them cause there's,</v>

194
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.760

195
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

200
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's also probably people that are like hoping that he'll just pay him x.</v>

201
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.721
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

202
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:17.530

207
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

208
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're not making money anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>huge benefactor of that brand and he is the number one chew,</v>

00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 2>huge multibillion dollar business.</v>

226
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

227
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>His shoes still outsell the Bron and Kolby,</v>

245
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.131
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

246

00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>His name rings in the hallowed halls.</v>

251
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>

252
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.031
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

253
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:29.421

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.650

255
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.973
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

256
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

257
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 2>But how many athletes can say that?</v>

258
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.923
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

259
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.351
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

263
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like a Q rating where they rank the impact of just athletes and the</v>

264
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>top 10 is like always the craziest list of guys who you all,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean Michael Jordan is number one.</v>

268
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 2>He's been number one for like 25 years and the lowest he ever dipped,</v>

269
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 2>he went to like number two once under tiger woods.</v>

270
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.531
<v Speaker 2>Pissed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thing is that he is a notorious gambler.</v>

279
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And he would bet wouldn't,</v>

280
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't uncommon for him to bet a quarter million on a round of golf.</v>

281
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And he would also,</v>

<v Speaker 2>$100 million a year close to it for 10 years.</v>

332
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

333
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take?</v>

334
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.551
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a billion?</v>

335
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.384
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it has a billion?</v>

336
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.170

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

340
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 2>if you make an 80 million a year,</v>

341
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>and he was famous for,</v>

342
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was him or his agent at the time,</v>

343
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but he's famous for being one of the innovators in the,</v>

344
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>when he was getting these crazy,</v>

345
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

346
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 2>endorsement deals,</v>

347
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 2>he was getting stock as part of his deal.</v>

348
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:46.154
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

349
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>he would get millions of dollars to sponsor,</v>

350
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 2>to be the endorser of Gatorade,</v>

352
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>but then insisted on owning stock.</v>

353
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

354
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.321
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

355
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>When Michael Jordan started endorsing Gatorade,</v>

356
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 2>stock went up pretty significantly,</v>

357
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and he made many,</v>

358
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 2>many more millions than he would have.</v>

359
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 2>So he's pretty innovative in that sense too.</v>
