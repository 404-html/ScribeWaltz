<v Speaker 1>I always said it never fucking happened cause it cause I didn't want it to cause</v>

33
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want okay.</v>

34
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do it?</v>

35
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>It was thanksgiving.</v>

36
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It was right after the rolling stone magazine came out.</v>

37
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:56.101
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

38
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and I go back to party on what do you mean the rolling Stone magazine with a</v>

39
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>number of the rolling stone in 1997 called me the number one party animal in the</v>

40
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>country just for someone who's not,</v>

41
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know.</v>

42
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And then that was a big deal.</v>

43
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I became famous until I became famous in like Tampa,</v>

44
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>

45
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.351
<v Speaker 1>Tampa,</v>

46
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:10.861
<v Speaker 1>Tallahassee,</v>

47
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Gainesville,</v>

48
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Orlando,</v>

49
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>anywhere that I had people with four went to Florida state lived.</v>

50
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

51
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>they knew who I was.</v>

52
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

53
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>cause the fucking party guy.</v>

54
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>So if I went out shots,</v>

55
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>really we'd any do people put drugs in my hand.</v>

56
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Like it was fucking insane.</v>

57
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:24.931
<v Speaker 1>I get roof feed,</v>

58
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:25.381
<v Speaker 1>I got roof.</v>

59
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>He'd a couple of times.</v>

60
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So you became like a sort of a celebrity partier.</v>

61
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I became the guy that I'd walk after the,</v>

62
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>before the article I was just the loud,</v>

63
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>

64
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>shirtless guy on top of the bar,</v>

65
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>getting everyone in a frenzy.</v>

66
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>And then when the article came out,</v>

67
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it was like the fucking lineman would come to the bar.</v>

68
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I drank at the [inaudible] and they'd pull me aside and they're like,</v>

69
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking with us tonight.</v>

70
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>We want to drink with a party animal.</v>

71
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd just be up with these lines and like four lineman and we'd be just</v>

72
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>doing shots and shots and shots and these guys are 350 pounds,</v>

73
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>two to 18 at the time,</v>

74
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>probably like going through to 18 and probably more like two 25 but,</v>

75
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but and so I became like,</v>

76
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>like I say famous,</v>

77
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I say like reality show famous like the way Snookie her first season was,</v>

78
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:07.470

80
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.950

81
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>definitely in Orlando,</v>

82
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I knew 40% of the bar knew who I was in Tampa.</v>

83
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew who I was back when people actually read magazines.</v>

84
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the rolling stone stuff was crazy when that came out.</v>

85
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like being famous cut back to how I pissed on my girlfriend's table.</v>

86
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.910

148
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you probably had a t shirt of it explaining it.</v>

149
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.351
<v Speaker 1>Aw.</v>

150
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think about getting on the party animal tattooed anywhere in your</v>

151
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:03.321
<v Speaker 1>body?</v>

152
00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about getting a squirrel with a beer can and a cigarette that</v>

153
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>said the party squirrel on at one time.</v>

154
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.501
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to fuck it?</v>

155
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Question two.</v>

156
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So he told me what your 10 to about it.</v>

157
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I pulled you our world.</v>

158
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 1>If I was a cop and I pulled you over and you had a party squirreled Tatooine,</v>

159
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I immediately take you to jail.</v>

160
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

161
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:22.700

162
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Speaker 1>You've just got to get it out of them.</v>

163
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 1>We just going to sit down and go,</v>

164
00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:26.391

168
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:31.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll get you a nice quick sentence.</v>

169
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330

173
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

174
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>How much piss were we talking about here in my head?</v>

175
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen in your head.</v>

176
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:48.111
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen.</v>

186
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:56.750
<v Speaker 1>He didn't fucking sell you down the river.</v>

187
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he pissed on the table and then said that you did it.</v>

188
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why he woke you up in the morning.</v>

189
00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>He knew you blacked out and then you blame you for pissing on the table.</v>

190
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:04.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going through my head right now.</v>

191
00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>As I rolled back over and I go fuck them.</v>

192
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:06.944
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you will.</v>

193
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe that would be called shitting.</v>

248
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.221
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

249
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:07.671
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

250
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>we got locked in their food cabinet like in their,</v>

251
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>in their food closet,</v>

252
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>like a pantry because in their,</v>

253
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>because we were eating in their kitchen and then this and this.</v>

254
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:16.431
<v Speaker 1>I start,</v>

255
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:16.881
<v Speaker 1>remember I go,</v>

256
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

257
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>So like the girlfriend come out,</v>

258
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>the girlfriend's coming and it was a sliding door.</v>

259
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So it was we,</v>

260
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>we were eating and the girlfriends came out,</v>

261
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the sisters and they go,</v>

262
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking making a ton of noise.</v>

263
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So me and Danny went into the pantry and shut the door,</v>

264
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.970
<v Speaker 1>but then we couldn't figure out how to open it cause there wasn't a handle.</v>

265
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.300
<v Speaker 1>You guys were hammered and you cite a pantry.</v>

266
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>They shoved you in the Pantry to quiet you down.</v>

267
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>We shoved ourselves into the pantry so that we can continue eating.</v>

268
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.811
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

269
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:39.441
<v Speaker 1>we're going to bed.</v>

270
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>They left,</v>

271
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.731
<v Speaker 1>we went to the Pantry,</v>

272
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>shut the door.</v>

273
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember sitting in the pantry.</v>

274
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I do remember this distinctly is us being in the pantry thinking we are in a</v>

275
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>phone booth,</v>

276
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>laughing how hard all,</v>

277
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>they had all this food in this phone booth and we're like,</v>

278
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>he believe this bull Moose has fucking Doritos in it.</v>

279
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So then that's all I remember.</v>

280
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>So then he says to me,</v>

281
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>he goes them and he's really adamant.</v>

282
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>So he leaves and I lay back down and I'm like,</v>

283
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm me a frame for this shit.</v>

284
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.690
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I start,</v>

285
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:08.451
<v Speaker 1>do you ever have one of those?</v>

286
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:08.760

287
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>remember the dream you had last night and I distinctly remember seeing her dad</v>

288
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.311
<v Speaker 1>in his underwear.</v>

289
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.144
<v Speaker 1>In my dream.</v>

290
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

291
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.531
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

292
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I did have a dream about her dad and his underwear.</v>

293
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.343
<v Speaker 1>That's odd.</v>

294
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.423
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

295
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but he was in here yelling at me.</v>

296
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.140
<v Speaker 1>There's not a jury in yet.</v>

297
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>She danced with an old man.</v>

298
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

299
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.141
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

300
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>

301
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:25.551
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

302
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and then I start going,</v>

303
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.261
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

304
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>this totally did happen.</v>

305
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I woke up in the middle of the night,</v>

306
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>walked out to their dining room table,</v>

307
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>erect and tried to go to the bathroom.</v>

308
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>You know how you would kind of try to lean it down.</v>

309
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So I must have been making a ton of noise at their dining room table.</v>

310
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Pissed on their dining room table,</v>

311
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>full blown pissed on their dining.</v>

312
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.420
<v Speaker 1>When you're telling me this now,</v>

313
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>now I'm remembering.</v>

314
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

315
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.781

00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>You know how when you,</v>

324
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you have one of those nights where you're like in the bathroom,</v>

327
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>So I'm leaning forward over their dining room table,</v>

328
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to Piss,</v>

329
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>making a ton of noise,</v>

330
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>knocking everything off of it.</v>

331
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>He comes out in his tighty whities I remember that because she came back in and</v>

332
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I go to see your dad were tidy.</v>

333
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:07.911
<v Speaker 1>Whities and she goes,</v>

334
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.211

00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:13.294
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

341
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.580
