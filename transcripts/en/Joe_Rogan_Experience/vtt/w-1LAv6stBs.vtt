68
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.850

<v Speaker 1>These dogs were so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just had this air about them.</v>

145
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile they would do bite work,</v>

148
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:15.551
<v Speaker 1>like he would have these dudes in a suit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would hold them back and they </v>

149
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>let the dog loose and it was like a meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannon.</v>

150
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you shot a side of beef of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude's arm that they would just latch </v>

151
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>onto the guy and bring him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

152
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.861
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've engineered this dog that will </v>

153
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:30.371
<v Speaker 1>respond to your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every command is super intelligent and </v>

154
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>is gigantic and can mimic the primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack map and then shut it off and shut</v>

155
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.751
<v Speaker 1>it right off the superfund to physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what he's designed to do and do </v>

156
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.210
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impressed the.</v>

157
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.240
<v Speaker 1>That was the most impressive thing to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're on fear factors,</v>

158
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>what people have done with dog breeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dog training,</v>

159
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>like dogs that really know their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're impressive man.</v>

160
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have it locked down.</v>

161
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.780
<v Speaker 1>They're giving them treats and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting them up and they'd given them </v>

162
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>their affection or given them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition for what they'd done.</v>

163
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>These dogs will do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do whatever the fuck you say.</v>

164
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty nuts that we figured out a</v>

165
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.260
<v Speaker 1>way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I always think it's kind of funny that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will.</v>

167
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally love and respect people,</v>

168
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.991
<v Speaker 1>rescuing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a beautiful thing that </v>

169
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:12.971
<v Speaker 1>people do and then there's the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who will buy like a budget </v>

170
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:17.141
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely coming from a bad </v>

171
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:17.141
<v Speaker 1>place for like 100 bucks.</v>

172
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people do the dog and the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expect great results.</v>

174
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a place where they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $25 tattoos.</v>

175
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have this for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

176
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>like make a good investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people just say it's a dog.</v>

177
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>What could be wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

178
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of dogs with like I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bulldog.</v>

179
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>He's had to have a bunch of operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian just killed my mind.</v>

180
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a.</v>

181
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>he's got a hip dysplasia so he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get both his arms operated and there was</v>

182
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>like six grand man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was serious money.</v>

183
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was like $18,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for both of his arms.</v>

184
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:57.251
<v Speaker 1>He had have one operation and then had </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one like a while later and then </v>

185
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about replacing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>back hips and I'm like,</v>

186
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dog is lazy as fuck.</v>

187

<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People dog just likes to chill like you </v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

189
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.830

<v Speaker 1>but he seems happy.</v>

190
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>He might be in a little pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time he's just chilling,</v>

191
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a running dog.</v>

192
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just gonna.</v>

193
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Relax,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give a metal hips.</v>

196
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let them be fucked up.</v>

197
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's a dog that was given to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

198
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>if that there was a situation as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

199
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>if they wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have never wanted to get a dog </v>

200
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want.</v>

201
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I would look for dogs that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic propensity for hip dysplasia and</v>

202
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta you gotta think,</v>

204
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.530

<v Speaker 1>care of them.</v>

205
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>But you're adopting a giant bag of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking problems with some animals.</v>

206
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get them from a good breeder,</v>

298
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a coyote fucks a dog because that's </v>

299
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually.</v>

300
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

381
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Alaska.</v>

382
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:03.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a woman got attacked and killed by </v>

383
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:03.701

<v Speaker 1>So it's very rare.</v>

384
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:05.000

<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

391
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:17.630

<v Speaker 1>the history of time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then the population is so small now.</v>

411
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel that the strength to </v>

421
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:32.831

<v Speaker 1>It was all like monster stories and one </v>

422
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>of them was about this werewolf that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sneaking into these,</v>

423
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these people that sheep and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in the old west or some shit and </v>

425
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>had sheep and the Werewolf would sneak </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their pen and kill all the sheep,</v>

426
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the guy goes out there and he </v>

427
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:47.320
<v Speaker 1>gets attacked by this werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

428
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:47.320
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

429
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.831
<v Speaker 1>Would that be if Werewolf was out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaking people's pens and killing all </v>

<v Speaker 1>the animals?</v>

431
00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:50.860

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Mountain lions do do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a real point.</v>

434
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 1>If you live anywhere near mountain line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have animals in your yard,</v>

435
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.330

<v Speaker 1>Those are game.</v>

436
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.910

<v Speaker 1>fence and kill them and drag them in the</v>

437
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>

438
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>why is a wolf man any scarier than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

439
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because it couldn't have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

440
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 1>The wolf man.</v>

444
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:24.080

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.040
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this too many times </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcasts.</v>

465
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I have Wolfman fetishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've some crazy fucking werewolf thing.</v>

466
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

467
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Ever since I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved Werewolf movies.</v>

468
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Just like the idea that some sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were drawn werewolves.</v>

469
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

470
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

471
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

472
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 1>When I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before high school,</v>

473
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are like from when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>12 and 13,</v>

474
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked up.</v>

475
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Tap into something primal and Joe Rogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking.</v>

476
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I moved to the woods,</v>

477
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some part of me that wants to be</v>

478
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:48.321
<v Speaker 1>out with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody Seen Joe Rogan on a full </v>

479
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.940
<v Speaker 1>moon and why is he tweeting at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM?</v>

480
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad because I can't live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungle if I could live in the </v>

481
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.950
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in the jungle,</v>

482
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but there's no jungle in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I choose the woods.</v>

483
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I really would like to be just living </v>
<v Speaker 1>around animals and shit.</v>

484
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to represent some primal part </v>

485
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>of all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's something,</v>

486
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>there's some energy I think that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound so hippy,</v>

487
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:11.340
<v Speaker 1>faggy bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So true man.</v>

488
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like certain energy when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>around these animals.</v>

489
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:21.651
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the people that I lived near</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there was this crazy yoga lady,</v>

490
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>very nice lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crazy yoga lady and I was talking to</v>

494
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.151

<v Speaker 1>Because there's a fucking corner store </v>

495
00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:34.151
<v Speaker 1>up there that had a sign that if you get</v>

<v Speaker 1>attacked by a mountain lion,</v>

497
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you should fight back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're really gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to be able to do that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with the fact that you </v>

504
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:55.281
<v Speaker 1>are around these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beasts?</v>

505
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:56.570
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just let them all in.</v>

506
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:02.230
<v Speaker 3>When I walked through the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I let them know that I'm here among you.</v>

507
00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

508
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I love you and I love them and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked through and I've never had a </v>

509
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.750
<v Speaker 3>problem like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

510
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 3>you've been so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zigged,</v>

511
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 3>when you could have zagged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have walked right onto a </v>

512
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cougar protected are young.</v>

513
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.740
<v Speaker 3>You could have fucked up and walked into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking grizzly bear and he could have</v>

514
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:24.710
<v Speaker 3>been with its cobs and freaked out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to eat your face.</v>

515
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.180
<v Speaker 3>You got lucky.</v>

516
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You see all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all those documentaries hang out</v>

517
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:33.290
<v Speaker 1>with these predators long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do people think that they are better</v>

518
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:37.220
<v Speaker 1>than dear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that if there's love in</v>

519
00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it really?</v>

520
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's all love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does nature let this murderous </v>

521
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.961
<v Speaker 1>cougar snap this deers fucking neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck the blood out and then eat its guts</v>

522
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 3>first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what they do.</v>

523
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 3>They go God's first cause they don't eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass.</v>

524
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Then they get their vegetation by eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guts of the things that kill,</v>

525
00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it happen to the deer and not </v>

526
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.400
<v Speaker 3>to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just you really get thanked.</v>

527
00:21:02.401 --> 00:21:07.401
<v Speaker 3>The universe gives a fuck if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>around a Predator and it wants to eat </v>

528
00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:10.861
<v Speaker 3>and it looks at you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I ate one of these back in the </v>

529
00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:10.861
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try it again.</v>

530
00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

531
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I only get a hiker once every 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck it.</v>

532
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got that Muesli in their system.</v>

533
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

534
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 3>they'll jack you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when they get used to it.</v>

535
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an area I talked about in my </v>

536
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an area in India called the cinder bands</v>

537
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.940
<v Speaker 3>and they have a real problem with tigers</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because the congress have gotten </v>

538
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:31.940
<v Speaker 3>used to eating people.</v>

539
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.240
<v Speaker 3>The tsunamis typhoons rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wash a lot of bodies into the </v>

540
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.111
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people drowned musical with </v>

541
00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:40.111
<v Speaker 3>fucking villagers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

542
00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>These people are really poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're living in shacks on the river in</v>

543
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:47.131
<v Speaker 3>India and the Tigers eat the bodies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drown and so they get a taste of human </v>

544
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:49.260
<v Speaker 3>flesh and they just started jacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

545
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Just Jack and people go through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>article anywhere,</v>

546
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's videos on Youtube and look this </v>

547
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Speaker 3>up folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

548
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're at home or when you get home,</v>

549
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:03.211
<v Speaker 3>you got to check out Sunderbans Tigers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a bunch of cool </v>

550
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>documentaries online and one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these poor fox,</v>

551
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.080
<v Speaker 3>these guys are census takers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have to find out how many of </v>

552
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 3>these murderous monsters are out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tall grass,</v>

553
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 3>in the fucking tall grass out on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what did this guy,</v>

554
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 3>this guy has a rifle and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>helmet on.</v>

555
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the helmet has a mask on the back of</v>

556
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 3>the head because tigers like to sneak up</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind you and jack you.</v>

557
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you to see them coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want a jacket.</v>

558
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.640
<v Speaker 3>So these guys were wearing helmets to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect themselves from getting jacked </v>

559
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.151
<v Speaker 3>by monsters and they have a mask with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking face on the back of the head </v>

560
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 3>with a tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figured it out after a while that it was</v>

561
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:42.061
<v Speaker 3>just a face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they started jacking guys from the </v>

562
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:42.061
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

563
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 3>even though they have these face on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of dudes in the census,</v>

564
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.580
<v Speaker 3>takers get killed by tigers with fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>masks on,</v>

565
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 3>so now they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things can swim,</v>

566
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.280
<v Speaker 3>so they have to make sure that the boat </v>
<v Speaker 3>has an engine so they can swim faster </v>

567
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.521
<v Speaker 3>than the tiger can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can run 50 miles an hour and </v>

568
00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 3>they've killed 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the last 200 years.</v>

569
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Since then you'd think that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>would take up the challenge and be like,</v>

570
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tigers were smarter,</v>

571
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

572
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

573
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:09.230
<v Speaker 3>they're a part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're part of miniature.</v>

574
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Some regards there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

575
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes us that much better?</v>

576
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Because we have the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>

577
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 3>We don't need them around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>national animal.</v>

621
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Franklin was putting forward </v>

622
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Turkeys.</v>

623
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Turkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smartest bird that would have made </v>

<v Speaker 1>you're holding them and feeding them </v>

634
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.211
<v Speaker 1>everyday and they were a little little </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on your arm and you get shot in </v>

<v Speaker 1>Those birds of prayer trip,</v>

639
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>there was a hawk that landed on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranch and we knew something was off with</v>

640
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>it because it was just hanging around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

641
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 1>So my parents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

642
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>we got to try and bring it in.</v>

643
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 1>We got to try and get it to the bed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

644
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:27.821
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they sent me with a kitchen where </v>

645
00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:27.821
<v Speaker 1>they sure have bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

646
00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:32.640
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the kitchen glove and a little </v>

647
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>piece of steak yet though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like going very slowly,</v>

648
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>like looking at this hawk and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like thinking of the options.</v>

649
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Do I do I run like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

650
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.130

<v Speaker 1>domesticated hawk,</v>

651
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Speaker 1>so I was able to give it to meet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it dug it and then it hopped on the</v>

652
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.900
<v Speaker 1>kitchen glove that's brought it into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house they rescued it.</v>

653
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.880

<v Speaker 1>for that to have happened?</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's a bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that uh,</v>

705
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a whole blog about watching her </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform at the emmy's that I watched.</v>

706
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I watched her perform and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be fucking shitting me.</v>

707
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Like that was just sheer brilliance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordination with perfect singing and </v>

708
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.180
<v Speaker 1>just just so in tune with the crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had everyone mesmerized.</v>

709
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:31.600
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

710
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just shocked that nobody got </v>
<v Speaker 1>paint before.</v>

711
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not old.</v>

712
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not like she got there first like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody thought to call themselves pink.</v>

713
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there probably was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet some fucking dummy that just </v>

714
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:43.800
<v Speaker 1>didn't trademark it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

715
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

716
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Way before that whole Charlie Chaplin </v>
<v Speaker 4>was pink.</v>

717
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:55.291
<v Speaker 4>Once she don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she don't.</v>

718
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 4>She heard about me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she heard about me.</v>

719
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I created my name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my name.</v>

720
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.610
<v Speaker 1>There's always when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever someone famous gets famous,</v>

721
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:10.400
<v Speaker 1>there's always someone that thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

722
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time.</v>

723
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got my whole act.</v>

724
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 4>That's my whole routine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing that in the catskills.</v>

725
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Everything</v>

726
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.570
<v Speaker 1>he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that story so many times that</v>

727
00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:22.070
<v Speaker 1>a guy makes it and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

728
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:27.071
<v Speaker 1>you know that guy made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a guy back in like </v>

729
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Michigan who was scared to leave town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the guy he learned from that </v>

730
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.200
<v Speaker 1>guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's like creamer.</v>

731
00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:36.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a real Kramer Kramer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld,</v>

732
00:30:36.241 --> 00:30:41.241
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls himself the real Kramer and he </v>

733
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:44.120
<v Speaker 1>gives tours of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that burst through doors,</v>

734
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.980
<v Speaker 1>like universally acknowledged as the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who inspired that character.</v>

735
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So he somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let them capitalize on it and gives</v>

736
00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.580
<v Speaker 1>tours and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has got to be so twisted.</v>

737
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Boring.</v>

738
00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe for him it's like the shit,</v>

739
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if he was a dentist he'd be bored </v>

740
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:05.660
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dentist had his job,</v>

741
00:31:05.661 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he'd be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

742
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the dentist themselves mean who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what,</v>

743
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.740
<v Speaker 1>if he made really supposed to be Kramer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's got to be very eccentric.</v>

744
00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:20.741
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if that's really the guy who </v>

745
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:20.741
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've seen him in randomly and placements</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's one of the worst predicaments in </v>

758
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.201
<v Speaker 1>the history of the media for an actor,</v>

785
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.811
<v Speaker 3>that word still works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the few still freak out </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

814
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:09.110

<v Speaker 3>I would say that even saying it's a word</v>

815
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.140
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not even calling anybody yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just saying the word and you're </v>

816
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:14.550
<v Speaker 3>like candyman candyman character.</v>

817
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 3>It is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're in your,</v>

818
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying and in contention is going</v>

<v Speaker 3>And in,</v>

823
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in incanting it and saying it out loud,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run the risk of violence.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the few words were,</v>

827
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't even hear my own voice saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

828
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've had the courage to </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>

829
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it all the time and you fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>n word.</v>

834
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.120

<v Speaker 3>so it's not bad.</v>

837
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she was really a black then it would </v>

838
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.160
<v Speaker 3>feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's white.</v>

839
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.670

<v Speaker 3>You could be a white nigger.</v>

846
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a ridiculous point that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>argued throughout time.</v>

847
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be still going on.</v>

848
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should always be your intent.</v>

849
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.180
<v Speaker 3>It should always be like whenever you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any environment where you're not </v>

<v Speaker 3>talk honestly about how you feel about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The reason why we made the connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 3>he's also the reason why they have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>avatar flashlight.</v>

863
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Let me say this correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as a correction.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I say I was the alien pussy realities.</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is our space.</v>

867
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.880
<v Speaker 3>We pushed this out two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a space vagina.</v>

868
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.660
<v Speaker 3>We put some girls and some blue lipstick</v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

869
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this was.</v>

870
00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.680
<v Speaker 3>But it just happens that they're super </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot.</v>

871
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 3>And here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you didn't even make it look like a</v>

872
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 3>vagina at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how you did that.</v>

873
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Like doubleclick is a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of this.</v>

874
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.620
<v Speaker 3>The mold inside is like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>eggshells.</v>

875
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Greg's every site has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bowl has like different ribs inside.</v>

876
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Speaker 3>The urban myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that an urban myth,</v>

877
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 3>the razor blade in the vagina from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam,</v>

878
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 3>is that an urban myth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been do that.</v>

879
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.930
<v Speaker 3>You never heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now hookers would take these back in </v>

880
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam was like when I was a kid in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

881
00:37:16.331 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 3>When you're growing up in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in Vietnam,</v>

882
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:23.481
<v Speaker 3>I heard what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took a razor blades and they put </v>

883
00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.300
<v Speaker 3>them up the girl's vagina and he'd fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and cut your Dick and half.</v>

884

<v Speaker 3>You never heard that before?</v>

885
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.330

<v Speaker 3>If you heard of the rape condoms.</v>

886
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They shove it in the girl.</v>

888
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 3>The girl shoves it inside of her like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tampon.</v>

889
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:43.311
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's basically like an interior </v>

890
00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 3>lining for her vagina that's filled with</v>
<v Speaker 3>barbs.</v>

891
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Like fucking with fish hook type deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these guys,</v>

892
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.920

<v Speaker 3>Africa has been raped.</v>

895
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Certain areas of Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the areas where </v>

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 3>so give you a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was such an asshole that he would</v>

903
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:27.801
<v Speaker 3>rape you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think he'll kill you if you </v>

904
00:38:27.801 --> 00:38:27.801
<v Speaker 3>cut his dick up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 3>you were really shouldn't have raped </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

907
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I got fish hooks on my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deserve it.</v>

908
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

909
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 3>he's going to attack you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

910
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I would</v>

911
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.220
<v Speaker 5>assume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

912
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 5>I just thought I was actually out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Africa,</v>

913
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 5>Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tanzania,</v>

914
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:45.481
<v Speaker 5>Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and out with some of the tribes when we </v>

915
00:38:45.481 --> 00:38:47.791
<v Speaker 5>were working with some of the men out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there to try and actually instill </v>

916
00:38:47.791 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 5>traditional martial arts into them so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they could see some kind of martial</v>

917
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 5>arts in the tribesmen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

918
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:56.430
<v Speaker 5>and some of the inner inner city to slum</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids because really they have a whole </v>

919
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.610
<v Speaker 5>generation of fathers that are gone from</v>
<v Speaker 5>aids,</v>

920
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 5>just no father figures so they have no </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing else to really go to.</v>

921
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:06.361
<v Speaker 5>So they get picked up by gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get picked up by these war parties </v>

922
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:06.361
<v Speaker 5>and then they get turned into little </v>
<v Speaker 5>killer.</v>

923
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:10.891
<v Speaker 5>So what we trying to do is show them </v>
<v Speaker 5>some kind of paternal discipline and </v>

924
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 5>show them that they can be strong and </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful without having to be in a gang.</v>

925
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 5>And it was a really cool program and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>worked,</v>

926
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's fucking intense out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

927
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.400
<v Speaker 5>Really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We ended up having to stop the program </v>

928
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 5>because civil war broke out in Kenya and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just too nutty to keep doing it.</v>

929
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Damn it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty crazy over there teaching </v>

930
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 5>them martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

931
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very true.</v>

932
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Like traditional stylized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

933
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:37.880
<v Speaker 5>we weren't going into MMA ground and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pound.</v>

934
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:42.881
<v Speaker 5>She's like discipline karate type </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the Kata and definitely speaking</v>

935
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 5>to them and they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they dug it.</v>

936
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 5>I know it's kind of interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Africa is not known for martial arts,</v>

937
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like Africa is the cradle of </v>

938
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:53.880
<v Speaker 5>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

939
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.701
<v Speaker 5>That's where humans emanated from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But really martial arts didn't really </v>

940
00:39:56.701 --> 00:40:00.271
<v Speaker 5>pick up until they got to like Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was other martial arts are </v>

941
00:40:00.271 --> 00:40:03.091
<v Speaker 5>developed in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for whatever reason I think it's </v>

942
00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 5>because Africa was so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just went straight to weapons.</v>

943
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>

<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Africa,</v>

991
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 3>trip panning and when you cut a hole </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the top of the head,</v>

992
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.050
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

993
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some tribes in Africa,</v>

994
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.620
<v Speaker 3>the gnarliest shit to their bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always tried to figure out what </v>

995
00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.260
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're where,</v>

996
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's that coming from?</v>

997
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.060
<v Speaker 3>But one of them is trapping t r e p a n </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it means cutting a hole through</v>

998
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 3>the skull and exposing the brain.</v>

999
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.430
<v Speaker 3>And this one guy had done it 20 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antiseptic conditions?</v>

1000
00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.750
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it with coconut shells and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1002
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Fucking cut your head open with a sharp </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

1003
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not joking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are using rocks and shit,</v>

1004
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 3>carving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carving,</v>

1005
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no anesthetic whatsoever.</v>

1006
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Carving into dude skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the women in Surrey who cut the</v>

1007
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:47.330
<v Speaker 3>hole in their lip and they put plates in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bigger the plate,</v>

1008
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 3>the more cows you're worth when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

1009
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is all those?</v>

1010
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Those are tough to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that are on vacation,</v>

1011
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 3>they did a lot of that one that's easier</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out.</v>

1012
00:42:56.931 --> 00:43:01.931
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's maybe the worst is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clutter ectomies are done by the </v>

1013
00:43:01.931 --> 00:43:01.931

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean just them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1015
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.170
<v Speaker 3>More bad and it's just know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once,</v>

1016
00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they do that,</v>

1017
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 3>like sex is just never pleasurable.</v>

1018
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1019
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to do it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>control these chicks for life.</v>

00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:07.151
<v Speaker 3>for so many firsts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1040
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:11.201
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamia Babylonia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Iraq is ancient Sumerian or they </v>

1041
00:44:11.201 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 3>had the first written language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first agriculture,</v>

1042
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.550
<v Speaker 3>the first government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first astrology,</v>

1043
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:19.630
<v Speaker 3>the first astronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they had a lot of,</v>

1044
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.740
<v Speaker 3>a lot of first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a brilliant,</v>

1045
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 3>brilliant place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean so much.</v>

1046
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 3>So much development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody,</v>

1047
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.490
<v Speaker 3>like in all good places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got tired of the Douche bags and he</v>

1048
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:33.491
<v Speaker 3>moved and everybody's spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civilization spread out across the </v>

1049
00:44:33.491 --> 00:44:33.491
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like America.</v>

1050
00:44:33.491 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 3>If you go the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of holdouts.</v>

1051
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of stubborn people that go,</v>

1052
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I fucking like in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck everybody else and what they really</v>

1053
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 3>are is the grandchildren and children of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking savages.</v>

1054
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 3>People in Ireland and Poland and </v>
<v Speaker 3>England,</v>

1055
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:55.570
<v Speaker 3>that that life over there sucked so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>cock that they were willing to get in a </v>

1056
00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>boat for months and come to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>someplace,</v>

1057
00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.440
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know what the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly they get there and then </v>

1058
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.421
<v Speaker 3>they huddle up and they try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out this new place and fight off the </v>

1059
00:45:05.421 --> 00:45:08.181
<v Speaker 3>fucking Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do whatever they have to do to make a </v>

1060
00:45:08.181 --> 00:45:08.181
<v Speaker 3>business and get everybody's smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals.</v>

1061
00:45:08.181 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be someplace better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1062
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Let's get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they started traveling west.</v>

1063
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Devote your vital energy to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>besides bear survival.</v>

1064
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the VAT is the civilization </v>

1065
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.350
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assume Sumir and that is Iraq and that </v>

1066
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:24.350
<v Speaker 3>is the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle.</v>

1067
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 3>That's why the Middle East is so fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1068
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 3>That's where there's such haters over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1069
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

1070
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 6>I have a theory that I don't think has </v>
<v Speaker 6>been explored very much,</v>

1071
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 6>but it seems like in the desert areas of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world,</v>

1072
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:34.780
<v Speaker 6>they're very patriarchal dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1073
00:45:34.781 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 6>and then you get to the coast land,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get to the jungles,</v>

1074
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.871
<v Speaker 6>they have a lot more matriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 6>societies that have a lot more respect </v>

1075
00:45:41.871 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 6>for women and the religions or appear </v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

1076
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 6>Something about that dry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>arid landscape.</v>

1077
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:46.390
<v Speaker 6>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1078
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 6>the major desert religions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Judaism,</v>

1079
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 6>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Islam has really taken hold there.</v>

1080
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:56.151
<v Speaker 6>But for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of patriarchal dominance that </v>

1081
00:45:56.151 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 6>occurs out there and those</v>

1082
00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It demands hard,</v>

1084
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 3>hard living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1085
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you have to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be.</v>

1086
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.860
<v Speaker 3>And you also have to realize that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this hard radical ideology thousands</v>

1087
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years ago and a hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical ideologies.</v>

1088
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to break without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

1089
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sort of evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1090
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:22.791
<v Speaker 3>if their ideology about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how recent it's been </v>

1091
00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:26.121
<v Speaker 3>that they've been so strict with women </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the glitter ectomies and with the </v>

1092
00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Burkas and I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how recent has that been?</v>

1093
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's still going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1094
00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.900
<v Speaker 3>But I mean when did it start?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1095
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 3>how it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it something that's been going on for</v>

1096
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.300
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and thousands of these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100?</v>

1097
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1098
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.350
<v Speaker 3>When you have a situation where there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fear and a lot of religious </v>

1099
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.801
<v Speaker 3>fanaticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to change because </v>

1100
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:45.801
<v Speaker 3>everybody's scared.</v>

1101
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even the females for the clitoral </v>

1102
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 6>ectomies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of them feel like they can't become</v>

1103
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.730
<v Speaker 6>a woman until they get it.</v>

1104
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.480
<v Speaker 3>It's so ingrained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they make it illegal,</v>

1105
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually forcing some women </v>

1106
00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.340
<v Speaker 3>underground to get them done and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse conditions than the flint rock and</v>

1107
00:46:57.341 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 3>a chisel or whatever</v>

1108
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.370
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's a,</v>

1109
00:47:00.371 --> 00:47:01.240
<v Speaker 6>it's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1110
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:03.310
<v Speaker 6>you really got to attack it with </v>
<v Speaker 6>education,</v>

1111
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.830
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the only real option.</v>

1112
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where I think </v>

1113
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1114
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.010
<v Speaker 3>there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain levels of fear when it gets,</v>

1115
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 3>when fear gets ingrained into a culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it's control and that's what a </v>

1116
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:21.181
<v Speaker 3>lot of that is a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the controlling of lemon with the </v>

1117
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:23.260
<v Speaker 3>clothing and the dancing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to prevent other men from fucking</v>

1118
00:47:23.261 --> 00:47:24.430
<v Speaker 3>them and all that craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1119
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that should get a hold of a </v>

1120
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to get it out.</v>

1121
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it takes like a new person or a </v>

1122
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1123
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1124
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at least a culture or a person </v>

1125
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 3>rather than responsible for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people can wake up and go,</v>

1126
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a douche bag.</v>

1127
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:44.821
<v Speaker 3>I need to snap out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult for a culture to </v>

1128
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:44.821
<v Speaker 3>wake up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1129
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:44.821
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked up.</v>

1130
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what we're doing overseas.</v>

1131
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:51.421
<v Speaker 3>Look at were pretending that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on and we're making billions and </v>

1132
00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 3>we've got all these fucking dummies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are listening to us.</v>

1133
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:52.760
<v Speaker 3>We can do better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1134
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare that a culture wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a government wakes up or any large</v>

1135
00:47:56.951 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a person can wake up.</v>

1136
00:47:58.481 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1137
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best thing to do would be to</v>

1138
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 3>put Internet kiosks fucking everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>or just put that in satellite Internet.</v>

1139
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Just get them out there and have them </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch spice girls.</v>

1140
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Like at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1141
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say a quitter and kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of do that with the laptops you have.</v>

1142
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:15.350
<v Speaker 3>You seen those things as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they getting into.</v>

1143
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.580
<v Speaker 3>They're like throwing them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

1144
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely need some big </v>

1145
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.270
<v Speaker 3>inoculation of the retardation they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone through for decades and hundreds </v>

1146
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years.</v>

1147
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:33.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need something to get them to </v>

1148
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.341
<v Speaker 3>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get like people that are just </v>

1149
00:48:35.341 --> 00:48:38.101
<v Speaker 3>so wacky about a certain ideology to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where there is so nutty that </v>

1150
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 3>you're not even allowed to draw their </v>
<v Speaker 3>main dude.</v>

1151
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:41.200
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Think how crazy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't draw their main guy or they'll</v>

1153
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:48.610
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we tolerate this?</v>

1154
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Why does anyone tolerate that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely crazy.</v>

1155
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1156
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:58.561
<v Speaker 3>it's not saying no one saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed doesn't exist or never did </v>

1157
00:48:58.561 --> 00:48:58.561
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or he's not a prophet.</v>

1158
00:48:58.561 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 3>He might very well be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1159
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I am completely uneducated to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

1160
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 3>but you're telling me that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>draw them.</v>

1161
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's silly.</v>

1162
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>One of the tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a great philosophy instructor when</v>

1163
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:13.381
<v Speaker 3>I was going to school and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenants that he thought he was </v>

1164
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:13.381
<v Speaker 3>philosophy of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a specialist,</v>

1165
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any God that should be worship should be</v>

1166
00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 3>worthy of worship.</v>

1167
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're a god in someone's drawing </v>

1168
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.051
<v Speaker 3>you and you're going to Mike them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that dude isn't worthy of </v>

1169
00:49:25.051 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 3>followers that smite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1170
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 3>But it's because it was fighting because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel it's an offense to God right </v>

1171
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone's drawing you,</v>

1172
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does that mean that you're better </v>

1173
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>than God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be.</v>

1174
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.740
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a system where you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the god isn't worthy of worship and </v>

1175
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 3>being as good as another man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was my,</v>

1176
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.360
<v Speaker 3>my thought is that all of this is seem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so archaic and ridiculous.</v>

1177
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.600
<v Speaker 3>It seems so several thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that this kind of ideology </v>

1178
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.840
<v Speaker 3>is allowed to live through this age of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information like deep into the two </v>

1179
00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:57.840
<v Speaker 3>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

1180
00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

1181
00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1182
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real grain of truth at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of all these religions says </v>

1183
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm beautiful things.</v>

1184
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure in the Koran,</v>

1185
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as familiar as I am with some of</v>

1186
00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 3>the other works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen a little bit,</v>

1187
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 3>here's beautiful passages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual,</v>

1188
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.480
<v Speaker 3>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really powerfully beautiful passages</v>

1189
00:50:16.481 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

1190
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men get in there and they're able to </v>

1191
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 3>utilize that as a mechanism of power to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wield more power over other people.</v>

1192
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.860
<v Speaker 3>It just gets kinda twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the origin of it all?</v>

1193
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it isn't the word of God,</v>

1194
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:33.881
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it smart people who figure some </v>

1195
00:50:33.881 --> 00:50:36.491
<v Speaker 3>things out and somehow or another figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to tell it to people and those </v>

1196
00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:40.181
<v Speaker 3>people tell it to each other for </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and then it </v>

1197
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:42.731
<v Speaker 3>eventually gets written down and by that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point it's become fables and the words </v>

1198
00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:46.430
<v Speaker 3>have been twisted and things have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange and the translations are off the</v>

1199
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 3>memories off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1200
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're dealing with something </v>
<v Speaker 3>as big as the Bible,</v>

1201
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>how many hundreds of pages that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

1202
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do try to like say it is a spoken</v>

1203
00:50:57.141 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 3>word thing for like a thousand years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they wrote it down.</v>

1204
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.220
<v Speaker 6>It was a while and they had a council to</v>
<v Speaker 6>decide,</v>

1205
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like an editing where they </v>

1206
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 6>decided which now this goes in.</v>

1207
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:12.180
<v Speaker 3>How about the fucking New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new testament that even better than </v>

1208
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.731
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were candidates for the new </v>

1209
00:51:14.731 --> 00:51:14.731
<v Speaker 3>testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just threw out there,</v>

1210
00:51:14.731 --> 00:51:16.360
<v Speaker 3>like the editor just recently redid it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1211
00:51:16.361 --> 00:51:17.440
<v Speaker 3>the region is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.720
<v Speaker 3>They have like a newer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>newer tests.</v>

1213
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to Jesus and shit and</v>

1214
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.700
<v Speaker 3>he got some old notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got some old Tupac tapes and Jesus</v>

1215
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.030
<v Speaker 3>is like Tupac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're redoing his words,</v>

1216
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 3>talking snake sheet with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>apostles that willing to and all that.</v>

1217
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if we know Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They chose</v>

1218
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 6>words that fitted their fitted their </v>
<v Speaker 6>agenda.</v>

1219
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was constantine.</v>

1220
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.210
<v Speaker 3>That was one constant team was </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling Rome.</v>

1221
00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:43.710
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a smart dude.</v>

1222
00:51:43.711 --> 00:51:46.770
<v Speaker 3>He realized he needed a rope people up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one universal religion.</v>

1223
00:51:46.771 --> 00:51:47.820
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't be pagan</v>

1224
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.580
<v Speaker 6>that at that point though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the slave class had really outnumbered,</v>

1225
00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:53.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other classes.</v>

1226
00:51:53.081 --> 00:51:54.090
<v Speaker 6>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1227
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.810
<v Speaker 6>he says it came to him in a dream or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

1228
00:51:55.811 --> 00:52:00.811
<v Speaker 6>but I think he was trying to survive the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Christianity spread in the lower </v>

1229
00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:04.231
<v Speaker 6>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they idealize that theory that </v>

1230
00:52:04.231 --> 00:52:07.561
<v Speaker 6>they were going to go to heaven and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these rich people who are putting them </v>

1231
00:52:07.561 --> 00:52:07.561
<v Speaker 6>to work and doing shitty stuff to him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were going to go to hell.</v>

1232
00:52:07.561 --> 00:52:09.730
<v Speaker 6>So it took off and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh shit.</v>

1233
00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Almost our entire country is slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a Christian.</v>

1234
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:14.200
<v Speaker 6>Like Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a dream,</v>

1235
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:14.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1236
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.720
<v Speaker 6>and then that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what did it,</v>

1237
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he says it came to him in a dream,</v>

1238
00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.360
<v Speaker 6>but really I think it was survival.</v>

1239
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.930
<v Speaker 3>The Christians were just taken over that</v>

1240
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.360
<v Speaker 6>it was just too many in that lower class</v>
<v Speaker 6>versus the patricians who were well </v>

1241
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.030
<v Speaker 6>outnumbered at that point.</v>

1242
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:33.130
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a survival move more than </v>

1243
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:33.130
<v Speaker 3>control move.</v>

1244
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 6>I think so at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the adoption of Christianity,</v>

1245
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:35.910
<v Speaker 6>it was like he saw the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1246
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.980
<v Speaker 6>he saw the tide's going and he was going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to either get trampled by it or he was </v>

1247
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.080
<v Speaker 6>gonna go with.</v>

1248
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you have loved to been in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>war meeting?</v>

1249
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>

1250
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.830
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how are we going to handle this?</v>

1251
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.330
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got some shit.</v>

1252
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Some shit is going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what people.</v>

1253
00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.010
<v Speaker 3>They would pitchforks and torches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1254
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feeding him to the lions was just so mad</v>

1255
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.500
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's tell him.</v>

1256
00:52:56.501 --> 00:52:59.110
<v Speaker 3>We found Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that sound.</v>

1257
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.380
<v Speaker 3>We found God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking.</v>

1258
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm born again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about y'all.</v>

1259
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Are you born again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally bored again.</v>

1260
00:53:06.241 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Speaker 3>We can still keep everything going as </v>
<v Speaker 3>usual.</v>

1261
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1262
00:53:08.221 --> 00:53:08.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1263
00:53:08.641 --> 00:53:10.290
<v Speaker 3>We bring them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to include them,</v>

1264
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:12.620
<v Speaker 3>but they're not going to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1265
00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.560
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're born again.</v>

1266
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:18.561
<v Speaker 3>We're born again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>History has changed and he didn't even </v>

1267
00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:20.520
<v Speaker 3>become a Christian until right before he</v>

1271
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.730
<v Speaker 5>a long time in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he didn't start leading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tucking my fucking head in the water.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Is John Shelby spong.</v>

1279
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.240
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why Christianity must change or die?</v>

1280
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:49.950
<v Speaker 5>I think you actually posted a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>

1281
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:51.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:56.060
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a preacher who were Kinda is </v>

1283
00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:56.820
<v Speaker 5>commenting and very devout Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's commenting on,</v>

1284
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way Christianity has gone.</v>

1285
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 5>And second book is why Christianity must</v>
<v Speaker 5>change or die,</v>

1286
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 5>and it's really a poignant book for </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody interested in.</v>

1287
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 5>He was super fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1288
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.330
<v Speaker 5>we're on the control business.</v>

1289
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.310
<v Speaker 5>This is all the control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was like so upfront about it,</v>

1290
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:14.270
<v Speaker 5>like his whole entire career that he had</v>
<v Speaker 5>brutally honest.</v>

1291
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.820
<v Speaker 5>His first book goes through different </v>
<v Speaker 5>passages and basically attacks the </v>

1292
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.970
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalist position of Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 5>and says,</v>

1293
00:54:20.971 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1294
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:23.160
<v Speaker 5>this doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was a book.</v>

1295
00:54:23.161 --> 00:54:24.440
<v Speaker 5>It was a guidebook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1296
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 5>there's lots of stuff that doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of sense in here anymore.</v>

1297
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go through this,</v>

1298
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:33.291
<v Speaker 5>let's get rid of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then a second book philosophically </v>

1299
00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:35.570
<v Speaker 5>talks about how the evolution and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity needs to be in order for </v>

1300
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 5>that religion to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think ultimately it will.</v>

1301
00:54:36.871 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 5>I think it's happening like the fire and</v>
<v Speaker 5>brimstone that used to be,</v>

1302
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:45.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Bosch paintings of people just </v>

1303
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 5>getting ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you go to El Duomo in Florence,</v>

1304
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 5>you look up at the ceiling and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>demons with these big,</v>

1305
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 5>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big giant.</v>

1306
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't flaming staff shoving it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's asses?</v>

1307
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:57.170
<v Speaker 5>It's like shoving one in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some girl's pussy in.</v>

1308
00:54:57.171 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 5>You're in this church,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful church and you're like,</v>

1309
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.190

<v Speaker 5>Like ill Duomo,</v>

1310
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:11.770
<v Speaker 5>Duomo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the center church in the middle of </v>

1311
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 5>Florence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Climb up this fucking bananas.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Do they have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They must have the photos.</v>

1314
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1315
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.900
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what is the story behind all that?</v>

1316
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean at that point,</v>

1317
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:26.211

<v Speaker 5>Well it was for sodomy and adultery and </v>

<v Speaker 5>but they would be punished by the Duomo.</v>

1319
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 5>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it might be ill since it's Italy</v>

<v Speaker 5>Some of the sculptures.</v>

1340
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:34.561
<v Speaker 5>I looked at some of the work by this </v>
<v Speaker 5>artist named Bernini and I sat this one </v>

1341
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 5>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a lady sitting on the pillows,</v>

1342
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:40.711
<v Speaker 5>the name a name a while Bernini actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>did the ones that were like Daphne and </v>

1343
00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:45.500
<v Speaker 5>Apollo and the rape of [inaudible] 70 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just to look at how they.</v>

1344
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 5>He was able to sculpt someone's fingers </v>
<v Speaker 5>digging into someone's flesh.</v>

1345
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 5>Like Haiti's is digging into perceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's into her side,</v>

1346
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 5>like grabbing the side of it and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot believe that it's marble.</v>

1347
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean just the way that he makes it </v>
<v Speaker 5>like flashy and lifelike.</v>

1348
00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:02.320
<v Speaker 5>Canova did the same thing with this lady</v>
<v Speaker 5>reclining on a pillow,</v>

1349
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:06.350
<v Speaker 5>just sculpting sheets out of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of marble that looked like they're,</v>

1350
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:11.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could fluff them in the breeze just </v>

1351
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.231
<v Speaker 5>incredibly you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all this stuff just passed on </v>

1352
00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:18.121
<v Speaker 5>through generation after generation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>learning how to work with stone and </v>

1353
00:57:18.121 --> 00:57:18.660
<v Speaker 5>carve and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll never be duplicated.</v>

1355
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:21.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like no,</v>

1356
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:27.050
<v Speaker 5>just way too lazy carbon shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck all the weaknesses and the marble </v>

1357
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:32.660
<v Speaker 5>and envisioning what could come out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1358
00:57:32.661 --> 00:57:37.661
<v Speaker 5>But we'll do some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like walk through the Amazon will do </v>

1359
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 5>some shit.</v>

1360
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm going to be the first guy like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Douche bag.</v>

1361
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Do you know you can take a boat and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a few hours you go all around.</v>

1362
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Well you know what's even crazier than </v>
<v Speaker 5>walking through the Amazon.</v>

1363
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big River Man.</v>

1364
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 5>The dude who swam the Amazon bods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he swam the Amazon.</v>

1365
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.360
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this one will be easy to bring.</v>

1366
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 5>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a big river man.com.</v>

1367
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:01.410
<v Speaker 5>And see that dude is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's from like a rounded die.</v>

1368
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 5>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does pretty much take 65 days,</v>

1369
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:06.730
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's this documentary of this guy and</v>

1370
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:11.731
<v Speaker 5>he started swimming because he had this </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcoholic father and his father would </v>

1371
00:58:11.731 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 5>come home and try and beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in eastern Europe,</v>

1372
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:13.690
<v Speaker 5>try and beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you figure it out.</v>

1373
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 5>They figured out if he went in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>river,</v>

1374
00:58:15.311 --> 00:58:20.311
<v Speaker 5>his dad wouldn't follow them and so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>just swim and his dad would chase him </v>

1375
00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:20.311
<v Speaker 5>along the riverside one.</v>

1376
00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:22.060
<v Speaker 5>And so eventually he learned to be this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stamina,</v>

1377
00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 5>endurance swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he got all fucked in the head,</v>

1378
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:29.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so he goes out and he swam all of </v>

1379
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:32.311
<v Speaker 5>the world's biggest rivers and so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes out on the Amazon and I just </v>

1380
00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:36.081
<v Speaker 5>thought it's happened to catch this late</v>
<v Speaker 5>night and I was just amazed and he </v>

1381
00:58:36.081 --> 00:58:38.731
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a normal swimmer would like take </v>

1382
00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:41.911
<v Speaker 5>their protein and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like getting them to throw bottles </v>

1383
00:58:41.911 --> 00:58:42.510
<v Speaker 5>of wine in the water and whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He comes off,</v>

1384
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 5>he drinks two bottles of wine and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not even in shape.</v>

1385
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's kind of like Chubby,</v>

1386
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.090
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1387
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.390
<v Speaker 5>and he gets there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then around day 14,</v>

1388
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 5>you know all the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's drinking the water from the Amazon,</v>

1389
00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:58.621
<v Speaker 5>so all the sites get him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has an onboard doctor and he's like </v>

1390
00:58:58.621 --> 00:59:02.101
<v Speaker 5>shocking himself with electroshock </v>
<v Speaker 5>therapy to kill the parasites and he's </v>

1391
00:59:02.101 --> 00:59:04.540
<v Speaker 5>like screaming with stuff and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>batteries attached to them.</v>

1392
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then around the 40th day,</v>

1393
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 5>the last you ever hear from him in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary,</v>

1394
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:14.611
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm crossing into the fourth dimension </v>

1395
00:59:14.611 --> 00:59:16.930
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he just fucking gone at that point,</v>

1396
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 5>just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then say he'll like wake up early in</v>

1397
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 5>the morning and swim away from the boat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they won't know where he is</v>

1398
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pointing their light out and trying</v>

1399
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:29.291
<v Speaker 1>to find him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see him naked on some river bank </v>

1400
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:32.081
<v Speaker 1>looking at driftwood just because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucked to begin with.</v>

1401
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Or was it all the parasites?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the parasites and just not </v>

1402
00:59:38.771 --> 00:59:38.800
<v Speaker 1>taking care of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exhaustion.</v>

1403
00:59:38.801 --> 00:59:41.380
<v Speaker 1>He so sunburned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked to wear this mask.</v>

1404
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.930
<v Speaker 1>He looks like silence of the lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mask covering his face.</v>

1405
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nutty.</v>

1406
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Big River man is the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin strehle I believe is his name </v>

1407
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:53.210
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

1408
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 1>There's some motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a broad spectrum of human beings.</v>

1409
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It's broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1410
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just when you think you've got people </v>

1411
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 1>completely figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find some new one online.</v>

1412
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>You'll see some new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when he was swimming the </v>

1413
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.541
<v Speaker 1>Yangtze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so dirty and some of the </v>

1414
01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.551
<v Speaker 1>industrial areas that he had to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightly blood transfusions from a nurse </v>

1415
01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:19.721
<v Speaker 1>on the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just new blood in blood out and he just </v>

1416
01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>kept swimming.</v>

1417
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Pictures of that swim or just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1418
01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>he wants to swim all of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivers of the world.</v>

1419
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>What is it about people doing dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they don't have to do?</v>

1420
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that if you get thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Amazon,</v>

1421
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:39.941
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out a way to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay alive and make it to the shore </v>

1422
01:00:39.941 --> 01:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and then get back to safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I survived in the woods.</v>

1423
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started a fire with rocks.</v>

1424
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I know how to get back and I got back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I made it.</v>

1425
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:51.251
<v Speaker 1>That's an excellent story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you thrust yourself into that </v>

1426
01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's not a game,</v>

1427
01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1428
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that is that it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival instinct that is propagated </v>

1429
01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 1>this species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the instinct to reproduce and doing</v>

1430
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>dangerous shit has always gotten checks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really that's what it is.</v>

1431
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1432
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you account for chicks that like </v>

1433
01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>getting hot air balloons and go across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1434
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>How about this chick who's rolling her </v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

1435
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>She's on a sail boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like 16 and she's sailing across </v>

1436
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>

1437
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>She's a lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to get some.</v>

1438
01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's some kind of,</v>

1439
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of tapping into the same.</v>

1440
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Some of the same instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean two lesbians trying to pick up </v>

1441
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>street chicks is just as creepy as dudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick up straight checks.</v>

1442
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>My girl certainly gets her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's her fair share.</v>

1609
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>young enough to be having fun in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

1610
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Have some fun friends and if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun friends,</v>

1611
01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 1>they're going to see some fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1612
01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:11.430
<v Speaker 1>If they're going to see some fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1613
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:13.380
<v Speaker 1>then I want you to see it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1614
01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it tweaks,</v>

1615
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>they're going to want to send</v>

1616
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.990
<v Speaker 3>it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to.</v>

1617
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.590
<v Speaker 3>They're going to want to be the one that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shocks you.</v>

1618
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 3>It's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1619
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.950
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1620
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:27.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every once in a while just reading a </v>

1621
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:27.990
<v Speaker 6>book with actual pages,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1622
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 6>because I got the ipad thing and that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like that too,</v>

1623
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's sometimes comforting.</v>

1624
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Go back a page of letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've tried this recently and this was </v>

1625
01:08:39.641 --> 01:08:42.330
<v Speaker 3>a big thing that I do is a sensory </v>
<v Speaker 3>deprivation tank.</v>

1626
01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:43.750
<v Speaker 3>You just tried it for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1627
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what did you,</v>

1628
01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:46.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd you think about that?</v>

1629
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 6>I think I sent this to you in an email,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I likened it to the first time I had</v>

1630
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:55.121
<v Speaker 6>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I could tell it was something rad </v>

1631
01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:56.240
<v Speaker 6>and I knew I was going to dig it for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>most the rest of my life,</v>

1632
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 6>but I was terrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like just not quite good at it yet,</v>

1633
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to really just relax your mind.</v>

1634
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 6>And I was fidgeting with how comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

1635
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 6>but then I also was super tired when I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was in there,</v>

1636
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:11.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a long week and I didn't have it,</v>

1637
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>available to me except for you know,</v>

1638
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:18.551
<v Speaker 6>kind of late in the evening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I wanted to make sure I got in so I </v>

1639
01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:21.941
<v Speaker 6>started to fall asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was just crazy consciousness and </v>

1640
01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:25.011
<v Speaker 6>asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sleep like I saw this window of where </v>

1641
01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:27.431
<v Speaker 6>sleep was and I could visually see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could see it with my eyes open and I </v>

1642
01:09:27.431 --> 01:09:31.691
<v Speaker 6>could crawl in it and I was asleep and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>could crawl out of it and not be asleep </v>

1643
01:09:31.821 --> 01:09:36.410
<v Speaker 6>and I was fully in control of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of how it was going and that was pretty.</v>

1644
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.740
<v Speaker 6>That was pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean what you're able to do with your </v>

1645
01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:44.531
<v Speaker 6>mind in that situation where you can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>tell when your eyes are open and your </v>

1646
01:09:44.531 --> 01:09:46.820
<v Speaker 6>eyes are closed and there's no feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no sensation on your body.</v>

1647
01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.910
<v Speaker 6>The amount of control I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>exercise was amazing.</v>

1648
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 6>It didn't find any kind of great lucid </v>
<v Speaker 6>information out of it,</v>

1649
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 6>but the experience was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1650
01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:59.390
<v Speaker 6>I've never been able to see those layers</v>
<v Speaker 6>because usually you just pass out.</v>

1651
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:01.610
<v Speaker 6>You don't know when you fell asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of a sudden you're awake.</v>

1652
01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:06.611
<v Speaker 6>You remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then all of a sudden you're asleep and </v>

1653
01:10:06.611 --> 01:10:06.611
<v Speaker 6>you wake up the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this.</v>

1654
01:10:06.611 --> 01:10:08.120
<v Speaker 6>I was able to see the steps in between.</v>

1655
01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:11.520
<v Speaker 3>He never realized how quiet it is until </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power goes out in your house.</v>

1656
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:17.110
<v Speaker 3>You know when the power goes out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and the power's out </v>

1657
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:19.131
<v Speaker 3>everywhere that you hear things go off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and is that that dead silence that you </v>

1658
01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.270
<v Speaker 3>don't get any other way while the tank?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that times a million?</v>

1659
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tank is that with your body?</v>

1660
01:10:26.251 --> 01:10:29.190
<v Speaker 3>It shuts everything off everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1661
01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.990
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that I always </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>

1662
01:10:30.991 --> 01:10:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I talk about on this podcast all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1663
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I talk about in interviews all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing that I'm,</v>

1664
01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.990
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say is that I'm.</v>

1665
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm always shocked that people don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1666
01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm always shocked that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about this.</v>

1667
01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm shocked that there's not one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these on every corner that people aren't</v>

1668
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.330
<v Speaker 3>having these things put in their house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have Jacuzzi to put in their house.</v>

1669
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you have an isolation tank?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you not want to be happy?</v>

1670
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Do you not want to think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to relax.</v>

1671
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.950
<v Speaker 3>People are running like hell from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own thoughts.</v>

1672
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.130
<v Speaker 3>That's too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much work,</v>

1673
01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.150
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's too much work.</v>

1674
01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:04.560
<v Speaker 3>It's more work to to run for Miss Shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>than it is to face your shit,</v>

1675
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there's no face in your shit.</v>

1676
01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Like facing your shit in that tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1677
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:12.300
<v Speaker 3>When you can't hide behind any bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in there,</v>

1678
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.190
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1679
01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>there's no distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you get right </v>

1680
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>immediately to the whatever it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with you.</v>

1681
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once you get good at that,</v>

1682
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.580
<v Speaker 3>then you become a I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he become an astral traveler.</v>

1683
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 3>You get in there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn how to,</v>

1684
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 3>how to really let go lock in quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't lock.</v>

1685
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I lock in within 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone.</v>

1686
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I it always.</v>

1687
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.650
<v Speaker 3>The thing is you always got to get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to relax.</v>

1688
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:43.950
<v Speaker 3>There's so much carrying around and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't realize how much tension you have </v>

1689
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:48.831
<v Speaker 3>in you until you in a zero gravity </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and you realize you're </v>

1690
01:11:48.831 --> 01:11:51.681
<v Speaker 3>holding yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like pulling yourself in like </v>

1691
01:11:51.681 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 3>your back muscles are pulled in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms and pulling.</v>

1692
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't even realize you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1693
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 3>You're like fighting the world all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1694
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 3>but when you get in there and then all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit goes away.</v>

1695
01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Then about 15 minutes and once the </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing stabilizes and I go that I'm </v>

1696
01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:11.121
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm often the land of wild </v>

1697
01:12:11.121 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations and fucking vivid dreams </v>
<v Speaker 3>and lucid dreaming and flying and uh,</v>

1698
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:18.950
<v Speaker 3>communicating with entities and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>things explained to you in gigantic </v>

1699
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:24.261
<v Speaker 3>three dimensional numbers from an alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet that are rotating around you and </v>

1700
01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 3>some big hall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scope that's like,</v>

1701
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hologram that shaped like the </v>

1702
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.061
<v Speaker 3>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching the universe being </v>

1703
01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:34.401
<v Speaker 3>explained to me in letters that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>from another planet that we're spinning </v>

1704
01:12:34.401 --> 01:12:38.001
<v Speaker 3>around that were three dimensional and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all being orchestrated by these </v>

1705
01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:41.721
<v Speaker 3>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it made sense to me while I was </v>

1706
01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:43.761
<v Speaker 3>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out their code </v>

1707
01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:43.761
<v Speaker 3>and their patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is okay.</v>

1708
01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:44.880
<v Speaker 3>So this is how the whole universe works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all works.</v>

1709
01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:47.220
<v Speaker 3>But this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then everything goes into another thing.</v>

1710
01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:49.260
<v Speaker 3>And that goes deeper and deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper and deeper.</v>

1711
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.050
<v Speaker 3>That's how crazy the ticket.</v>

1712
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:52.490
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>

1713
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:53.570
<v Speaker 6>Not Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1714
01:12:53.571 --> 01:12:55.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's other ways to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1715
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:57.770
<v Speaker 6>There ain't no other way to get there </v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you're doing drugs.</v>

1716
01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.060
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1717
01:12:59.061 --> 01:13:00.560
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of where I was leading to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1718
01:13:00.561 --> 01:13:03.080
<v Speaker 6>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But even those are better in the tank.</v>

1719
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:04.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms in the tank or a totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>different animal man.</v>

1721
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mushroom gets to talk right to you.</v>

1722
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.880
<v Speaker 3>You know the weed in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weeds talking right to you.</v>

1723
01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:21.090
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my ass is on the couch and the light </v>

1724
01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.410
<v Speaker 3>is hitting my eyes and the elbow touches</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seat arm.</v>

1725
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.880
<v Speaker 3>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no input.</v>

1726
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 6>There's so many powerful weapons at our </v>
<v Speaker 6>disposal that people are so scared of.</v>

1727
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just crazy.</v>

1728
01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:31.800
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the tank is one of them,</v>

1729
01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 6>obviously a huge resource and it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

1730
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't complain about anything.</v>

1731
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:39.360
<v Speaker 6>But then there's other shamans for </v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

1732
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:44.361
<v Speaker 6>I think the best way I've heard it </v>
<v Speaker 6>described as as rad book or the cosmic </v>

1733
01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:47.871
<v Speaker 6>serpent by Jeremy and and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Shamans goal is to lead you to the </v>

1734
01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 6>realm of the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then allow you to defolk focalized.</v>

1735
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.430
<v Speaker 6>He talks about it like a stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Graham,</v>

1736
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 6>you remember those three d images where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1737
01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.160
<v Speaker 6>you relax your eyes and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the three d would pop out.</v>

1738
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:04.370
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what you're doing when you're in </v>

1739
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:06.141
<v Speaker 6>that kind of shamanistic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your [inaudible] your body and then </v>

1740
01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.970
<v Speaker 6>allowing communication to come through </v>
<v Speaker 6>and hit.</v>

1741
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 6>But his theories are pretty amazing.</v>

1742
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just these conversations </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1743
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 3>There's people right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>

1744
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's two groups of people that </v>

1745
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's more than two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to this subject,</v>

1746
01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:27.001
<v Speaker 3>there's people who've had psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences and people who have no </v>

1747
01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:30.631
<v Speaker 3>fucking idea what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally you think we're talking </v>

1748
01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:31.770
<v Speaker 3>about hippy fairy dust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1749
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.150
<v Speaker 3>like this is what it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1750
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1751
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>You're tuning in to what he had to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1752
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:38.080
<v Speaker 3>into what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1753
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 3>you're tuning into Santa Claus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>

1754
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:45.541
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like there's even </v>

1755
01:14:45.541 --> 01:14:47.341
<v Speaker 3>intelligent scientists that we'll have </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations and if you bring up any </v>

1756
01:14:47.341 --> 01:14:52.321
<v Speaker 3>sort of psychedelic or any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic compound or altered states </v>

1757
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just shut off on you.</v>

1758
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.360
<v Speaker 3>They just immediately discredit </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you're saying.</v>

1759
01:14:55.361 --> 01:15:00.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just talking about getting high </v>

1760
01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:00.361
<v Speaker 3>and muscles.</v>

1761
01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:00.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1762
01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 3>nice little box that they can and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>toss it away,</v>

1763
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.690
<v Speaker 3>but if they've done mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go,</v>

1764
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.410
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll look at you and go,</v>

1765
01:15:08.411 --> 01:15:09.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be that.</v>

1766
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:14.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be that I've talked to like </v>

1767
01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:14.311
<v Speaker 3>some serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious fucking scientists,</v>

1768
01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:18.631
<v Speaker 3>men and guys who have phds and guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>work at universities teaching schools </v>

1769
01:15:20.261 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 3>and any teaching physics courses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1770
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to them about psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and add some fascinating conversations </v>

1771
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 3>where people who are way smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1772
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:31.960
<v Speaker 3>way more educated than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1773
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:37.230
<v Speaker 3>way more experienced in the ways of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and they've had a bunch of </v>

1774
01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.070
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you like,</v>

1775
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.930
<v Speaker 3>who knows what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows what that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be a billion different </v>

1777
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.461
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a pretty cool theory by Jeremy </v>

1778
01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:47.461
<v Speaker 3>and rob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll give you the cliff notes here,</v>

1779
01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:51.121
<v Speaker 3>so for discussion sake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he went down to the Ios garrow </v>

1780
01:15:51.121 --> 01:15:55.171
<v Speaker 3>Charmaine's down in the jungle and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the Iowasca with them and he was </v>

1781
01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:57.580
<v Speaker 3>just an anthropologist just for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who don't know.</v>

1782
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's explain what Iowasca is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IOWASCA is two different plants.</v>

1783
01:16:01.421 --> 01:16:06.421
<v Speaker 3>There's the actual dimethyltryptamine </v>
<v Speaker 3>active plant that is part of a vine and </v>

1784
01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:10.280
<v Speaker 3>then somehow out of the 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>species in the Amazon,</v>

1785
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:11.860
<v Speaker 3>they figured out things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's other than that,</v>

1786
01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this other leaf that they needed</v>

1787
01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 3>to combine with it to actually make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and a Mao inhibitor.</v>

1788
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040
<v Speaker 3>So they combine this and they make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a tea and it's been part of the </v>

1789
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.040
<v Speaker 3>traditional religious ceremonies down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1790
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does dmt stuff is is a chemical </v>

1791
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 3>that it's the most potent psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug known to man,</v>

1792
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.480
<v Speaker 3>but it exists in a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>

1793
01:16:31.481 --> 01:16:34.090
<v Speaker 3>but you can't eat it because when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it,</v>

1794
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.120
<v Speaker 3>it exists in so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess your body has some protection </v>

1795
01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:39.850
<v Speaker 3>for because if you eat grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass has dmt in it,</v>

1796
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.140
<v Speaker 3>well there's a thing that your stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes called Mano aiming oxidation.</v>

1797
01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:48.170
<v Speaker 3>That's Mao.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these guys figured out how to mix an </v>

1798
01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.151
<v Speaker 3>Mao inhibitor that kills the Mao in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their system with this dmt so that they </v>

1799
01:16:51.151 --> 01:16:55.861
<v Speaker 3>can take it orally and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>owners when they interviewed the guys </v>

1800
01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 3>and they asked them how they figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit out thousands of years ago,</v>

1801
01:16:57.911 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said the plants,</v>

1802
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.840
<v Speaker 3>that's how they say about all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicines that they,</v>

1803
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.570
<v Speaker 3>the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Jeremy,</v>

1804
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>he took that and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could this be true?</v>

1805
01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:08.790
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science discredits it,</v>

1806
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but they prove it time and</v>

1807
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.560
<v Speaker 6>time again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They pick the shit that works.</v>

1808
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 6>And then modern Pharma goes down there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and say,</v>

1809
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does this do?</v>

1810
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:18.230
<v Speaker 6>And they know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So how do they know the answers?</v>

1811
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the theory is that this all comes</v>

1812
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 6>from your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain projects,</v>

1813
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 6>this stuff when you take </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

1814
01:17:24.411 --> 01:17:27.470
<v Speaker 6>But he has a different theory and his </v>
<v Speaker 6>theory goes that,</v>

1815
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:32.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in all of these cultures you see a lot </v>

1816
01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:35.231
<v Speaker 6>of serpents when you're underneath these</v>
<v Speaker 6>visions and these serpents are often </v>

1817
01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:36.860
<v Speaker 6>intertwined and you can see this written</v>
<v Speaker 6>in in rock paintings,</v>

1818
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:39.050
<v Speaker 6>in aboriginal Australia and all over the</v>
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

1819
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:44.410
<v Speaker 6>The vision of the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he calls it the cosmic serpent is </v>

1820
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.231
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what he's saying is that's actually </v>

1821
01:17:47.231 --> 01:17:48.740
<v Speaker 6>a vision of person's DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of DNA in general,</v>

1822
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:53.741
<v Speaker 6>not just the person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the DNA of life and that you're </v>

1823
01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 6>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're in that level,</v>

1824
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:58.490
<v Speaker 6>you're communicating on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>microbiological level with DNA,</v>

1825
01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 6>which is connects everything.</v>

1826
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:05.410
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like the Navi avatar </v>
<v Speaker 6>principle where everything is connected </v>

1827
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:09.701
<v Speaker 6>by the universal language of DNA and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>default realization of the IOWASCA </v>

1828
01:18:09.701 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 6>allows you to communicate with the DNA </v>
<v Speaker 6>so that the plants talk to you,</v>

1829
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:17.681
<v Speaker 6>that there's visions and wisdom from </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything that comes and the synthesis </v>

1830
01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:18.040
<v Speaker 6>is able to get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1831
01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 6>there's actually DNA emits and one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ways you say they communicate is DNA</v>

1832
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 6>emits actual light.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It emits photons.</v>

1833
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 6>DNA itself will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's too dim and it's too small when you</v>

1834
01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:33.341
<v Speaker 6>isolate DNA by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it'll emit a certain amount of </v>

1835
01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:33.341
<v Speaker 6>photons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know the,</v>

1836
01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:38.141
<v Speaker 6>all of these theories that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your beings of light and whatever and </v>

1837
01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:38.141
<v Speaker 6>everything's all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything is light.</v>

1838
01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sounds like you said,</v>

1839
01:18:38.751 --> 01:18:41.300
<v Speaker 6>like hippie stuff or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's cross culturally.</v>

1840
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.950
<v Speaker 6>People say this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well when you do Dmt,</v>

1841
01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:44.860
<v Speaker 6>that's what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two,</v>

1842
01:18:44.861 --> 01:18:46.500
<v Speaker 6>you see beings that are may not have </v>
<v Speaker 6>light.</v>

1843
01:18:46.501 --> 01:18:47.510
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1844
01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 6>And he's saying that's the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The DNA is the substance of life.</v>

1845
01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:53.930
<v Speaker 6>It's interconnected substance of life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

1846
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 6>that's basically the collective </v>
<v Speaker 6>unconscious,</v>

1847
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's how all different life</v>

1848
01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I see where you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to fuck.</v>

1849
01:19:04.481 --> 01:19:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And there's always the cynic those steps</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1850
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

1851
01:19:06.881 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 3>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you got.</v>

1852
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:13.091
<v Speaker 3>You've got chemicals interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain and you'd go loopy for a few </v>

1853
01:19:13.091 --> 01:19:16.760
<v Speaker 3>hours while your body tries to normalize</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poison you've put in your system.</v>

1854
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1855
01:19:17.221 --> 01:19:18.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you are.</v>

1856
01:19:18.341 --> 01:19:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just another religion,</v>

1857
01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:25.171
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just believe in some more wacky </v>

1858
01:19:25.171 --> 01:19:27.331
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that one ever tells me is that </v>

1859
01:19:27.331 --> 01:19:27.850
<v Speaker 3>dude hasn't done dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it tells me.</v>

1860
01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:31.600
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking shit about doing DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure you haven't done it.</v>

1861
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Because once you do it you go,</v>

1862
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:37.190
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh Whoa,</v>

1863
01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:38.040
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really,</v>

1864
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:41.470
<v Speaker 6>really changes the game.</v>

1865
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.670
<v Speaker 3>And these guys have been doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and people go,</v>

1866
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:47.950
<v Speaker 3>what we'll do through so's book smart </v>

<v Speaker 3>roads.</v>

1868
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Because if you are doing dmt all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1869
01:19:53.431 --> 01:19:58.431
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't give a fuck about tvs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV Ain't shit compared to being able to </v>

1870
01:19:58.431 --> 01:20:00.260
<v Speaker 3>communicate with the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck you.</v>

1871

<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It takes me an hour.</v>

1873
01:20:04.021 --> 01:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I have food,</v>

1874
01:20:05.461 --> 01:20:06.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go do some more.</v>

1875
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Tay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1876
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 3>The ios cares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call,</v>

1877
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 3>they call the Iowaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the television of the forest,</v>

1878
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 3>that's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is,</v>

1879
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:16.710
<v Speaker 3>that is where they go to the interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1880
01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Are there any television?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought some Iowasca back from,</v>

1881
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Brazil.</v>

1882
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 3>I believe this was in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1883
01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 3>when they first recognize it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive substance,</v>

1884
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.880
<v Speaker 3>they were going to call it telepathy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it allowed group think and </v>

1885
01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:37.761
<v Speaker 3>allowed to let pathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were going to pat it as </v>

1886
01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 3>telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't realize that the,</v>

1887
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:42.921
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the active compounds in it had </v>

1888
01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.681
<v Speaker 3>already been identified and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>harming and because harming had already </v>

1889
01:20:45.681 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 3>been identified because of the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific nomenclature,</v>

1890
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 3>like the thing they were naming had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already been named.</v>

1891
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:55.910
<v Speaker 3>So they couldn't call it telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what they were going to call </v>

1892
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.910
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going to call it telepathy.</v>

1893
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1894
01:20:56.191 --> 01:21:01.191
<v Speaker 3>that's the active ingredient or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that allows you to have </v>

1895
01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:01.191
<v Speaker 3>telepathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really like,</v>

1896
01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:01.890
<v Speaker 3>scientists are fucking writing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1897
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nutty shit man.</v>

1898
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It sounds so woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deepak Chopra,</v>

1899
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:10.530

<v Speaker 3>It sounds dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know it's real because I've done </v>

1902
01:21:17.931 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 3>things that people just automatically </v>
<v Speaker 3>label as silly automat.</v>

1903
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 3>These are life changing reset button </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressing motherfuckers.</v>

1904
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms,</v>

1906
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an honest question.</v>

1907
01:21:30.901 --> 01:21:35.901
<v Speaker 3>Do you talk about DMT everyday?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there days that you don't talk about </v>

1908
01:21:35.901 --> 01:21:35.901
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

1909
01:21:35.901 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 3>So amazing that like it's just flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't talk about anything every day.</v>

1910
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Bet I think about it every day.</v>

1911
01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:45.320
<v Speaker 3>There's always a moment where I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the shower by myself and go,</v>

1912
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't think that's kind of crazy </v>

1913
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:53.281
<v Speaker 3>that you're not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like if you were picked up by </v>

1914
01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:53.430
<v Speaker 3>God and take on a magical mystery tour </v>
<v Speaker 3>for three hours,</v>

1915
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the spaceship above fucking Pluto view </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be remembering that shit all the </v>

1916
01:21:58.670 --> 01:22:02.391
<v Speaker 3>time because it was the most extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience a human being could ever </v>

1917
01:22:02.391 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 3>possibly have felt that like in drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>

1918
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:05.240
<v Speaker 3>this is the most amazing thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole entire group,</v>

1919
01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:06.720
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like that.</v>

1920
01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1921
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.190
<v Speaker 3>This was the most amazing thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1922
01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:13.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this,</v>

1923
01:22:13.081 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 3>that this is even possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is impossible.</v>

1924
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.600
<v Speaker 3>That this exists is mind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this reality seems really than the </v>

1925
01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.300
<v Speaker 3>reality that I live in every day.</v>

1926
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:26.510
<v Speaker 3>The fact that there's something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like it's communicating with you </v>

1927
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:29.481
<v Speaker 3>and it's giving you a message that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're connected to everything and that </v>

1928
01:22:29.481 --> 01:22:33.501
<v Speaker 3>it's a gigantic illusion created by your</v>
<v Speaker 3>biology to keep you alive and to make </v>

1929
01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you sustain this other world that exists</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your dream consciousness.</v>

1930
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they communicate this shit to you and it</v>

1931
01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:44.631
<v Speaker 3>makes sense and whatever it is is sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>right through you and communicates only </v>

1932
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:49.530
<v Speaker 3>with love and is showing you impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe.</v>

1933
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Images and visuals and at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's all over,</v>

1934
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 3>you're changed forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can never get to go back on,</v>

1935
01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.620
<v Speaker 3>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

1936
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:03.621
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to make sure that </v>

1937
01:23:03.621 --> 01:23:05.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever you get out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can still talk to people.</v>

1938
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:08.630
<v Speaker 3>That's another much of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1939
01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to lose your grip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1940
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery.</v>

1941
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.700
<v Speaker 3>You could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>

1942
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:19.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy that I know that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoo artist that's done dmt like 100 </v>

1943
01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 3>times and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1944
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.480
<v Speaker 3>I have hung out with this dude and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did Eddie's arm know Eddie's a sleeve.</v>

1945
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say his name just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>case he doesn't want people knowing.</v>

1946
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude is got this fucking sniper stare.</v>

1947
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 3>He's got this look in his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1948
01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just been over there just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few too many times.</v>

1949
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Like he can't ever quite step back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real world.</v>

1950
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Like every corner he turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's fucking DMT.</v>

1951
01:23:45.431 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Elves stared at him from behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter.</v>

1952
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just been there too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1953
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had some very interesting.</v>

1954
01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing I think when you,</v>

1955
01:23:55.061 --> 01:23:56.710
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he does talk about it,</v>

1956
01:23:56.711 --> 01:23:59.680
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't go into depth like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm just yapping about it because I</v>

1957
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:02.290
<v Speaker 3>haven't done it in years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's still fresh in my mind.</v>

1958
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it start off like I'm talking about it a</v>

1959
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:08.920
<v Speaker 3>lot and then you start peeing your pants</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we can talk about it.</v>

1960
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:13.921
<v Speaker 3>You start seeing it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little flashbacks will pop into </v>

1961
01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 3>your head of things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not flashbacks,</v>

1962
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 3>like you were like you can't see or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hallucinating,</v>

1963
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 3>but just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

1964
01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1965
01:24:18.941 --> 01:24:19.870
<v Speaker 3>That happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1966
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

1967
01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you think about it again.</v>

1968
01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 6>There was one experience that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1969
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:27.040
<v Speaker 6>that I had at the traditional shaman out</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1970
01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>out in the desert here in the US.</v>

1971
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 6>And she took me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She took me out a girl Shama yeah,</v>

1972
01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:35.720
<v Speaker 6>female.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's hardcore and uh,</v>

1973
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.990
<v Speaker 6>and so with the music start.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1974
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:39.720
<v Speaker 6>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1975
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:43.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fasted for traditional preparation and</v>

1976
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.130
<v Speaker 6>I drank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drank,</v>

1977
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.570
<v Speaker 6>drank of substance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was,</v>

1978
01:24:46.571 --> 01:24:47.390
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1979
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 6>some kind of mushroom and other </v>
<v Speaker 6>traditional plant based substance.</v>

1980
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 6>And that what I got from that has </v>
<v Speaker 6>totally changed my life forever.</v>

1981
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.690
<v Speaker 6>At that point I was able to lift from my</v>
<v Speaker 6>body,</v>

1982
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.270
<v Speaker 6>lift from it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look down and realize,</v>

1983
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just the vessel,</v>

1984
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's useful.</v>

1985
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 6>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It allows me to flow through this world,</v>

1986
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 6>but it's not the end of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not the beal,</v>

1987
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:11.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's a separation.</v>

1988
01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:16.351
<v Speaker 6>There is a distinction between body and </v>
<v Speaker 6>spirit and from then the fear of death </v>

1989
01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:18.460
<v Speaker 6>evaporated for me and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would just be a shame.</v>

1990
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 6>Like I certainly don't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love life.</v>

1991
01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 6>Life is fucking rat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the fear of it is gone.</v>

1992
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.430
<v Speaker 3>There was just a loose nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1993
01:25:25.431 --> 01:25:30.431
<v Speaker 3>You were on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hanging out with a hot shaman </v>

1994
01:25:30.431 --> 01:25:33.250
<v Speaker 3>girl trying to get some pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a little carried up in the </v>

1995
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:33.380
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went a little barry manilow.</v>

1996
01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:36.050
<v Speaker 3>She's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put him on your shoulders,</v>

1997
01:25:36.051 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have been January shoulder.</v>

1998
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Everything of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever.</v>

1999
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the book of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the book,</v>

2000
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Sacred Mushroom in the cross?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard that story?</v>

2001
01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:47.180
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a little bit about John Marco</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegro,</v>

2002
01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.300
<v Speaker 3>who was the one of the head scholars of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

2003
01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:55.301
<v Speaker 3>He was in charged of deciphering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spent 14 years working on the oldest </v>

2004
01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:58.550
<v Speaker 3>version of the Bible by far and what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided after 14 years,</v>

2005
01:25:58.551 --> 01:26:03.551
<v Speaker 3>he wrote a book about it that the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian religion was a gigantic </v>

2006
01:26:03.551 --> 01:26:07.091
<v Speaker 3>misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it was initially all about was </v>

2007
01:26:07.091 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic mushrooms and fertility </v>
<v Speaker 3>rituals and he said,</v>

2008
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:14.081
<v Speaker 3>this is what the whole Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion was initially all about and </v>

2009
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2010
01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>has this fucking book dedicated to it.</v>

2011
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't follow it.</v>

2012
01:26:18.261 --> 01:26:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 3>ancient languages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no knowledge,</v>

2014
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.440
<v Speaker 3>but just the fact that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really well respected scholar and it </v>

2015
01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 3>came to these conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2016
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.070
<v Speaker 3>of course they were doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drugs were around.</v>

2017
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms have been around for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years.</v>

2018
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>What were the first ones to figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can eat it.</v>

2019
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.390
<v Speaker 3>People back then ate everything they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could write.</v>

2020
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>They had everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a truck.</v>

2021
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:44.890
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we know shit's poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because due to eight it and died and </v>

2022
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:44.890
<v Speaker 3>then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2023
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:44.890
<v Speaker 3>he ate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd died.</v>

2024
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read that.</v>

2025
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:49.000
<v Speaker 3>You try eating that because if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of this shit around it.</v>

2026
01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 3>This is edible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good,</v>

2027
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:51.230
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The apples are good.</v>

2028
01:26:51.231 --> 01:26:56.231
<v Speaker 3>Let's eat the apples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mean that's how they figured out </v>

2029
01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:56.231
<v Speaker 3>how to do things.</v>

2030
01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:56.231
<v Speaker 3>They ate everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2031
01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 3>They it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew what was good,</v>

2032
01:26:56.931 --> 01:27:01.931
<v Speaker 3>what was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if mushrooms are around and they </v>

2033
01:27:01.931 --> 01:27:01.931
<v Speaker 3>were people were eating them and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were eating them,</v>

2034
01:27:01.931 --> 01:27:04.160
<v Speaker 3>they were seeing God and if they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing God,</v>

2035
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want anybody else in on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

2036
01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:10.991
<v Speaker 3>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hid all their fucking knowledge </v>

2037
01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:13.481
<v Speaker 3>about these mushrooms and these rituals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put it in stories and they put </v>

2038
01:27:13.481 --> 01:27:17.501
<v Speaker 3>it in fables and parables and they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>twisted it all up so it was just a </v>

2039
01:27:17.501 --> 01:27:17.780
<v Speaker 3>little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucking.</v>

2041
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.040
<v Speaker 3>The forbidden fruit is a mushroom man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2042
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an ancient fresco in France,</v>

2043
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 3>there's this ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a painting rather,</v>

2044
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 3>and it's a on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this wall.</v>

2045
01:27:29.121 --> 01:27:34.121
<v Speaker 3>It's from fucking thousands of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's Adam and eve with a mushroom </v>

2046
01:27:34.121 --> 01:27:36.140
<v Speaker 3>tree is Adam and eve with mushroom caps </v>
<v Speaker 3>all around them.</v>

2047
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is the fucking forbidden fruit</v>

2048
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 6>and it's been squashed because if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>take that,</v>

2049
01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:43.830
<v Speaker 6>that's a direct link I feel to God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2050
01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I'm a both a spiritual person in a kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of a deistic believer in the,</v>

2051
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 6>in the universal God for us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you take,</v>

2052
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:55.890
<v Speaker 6>so you take away mushrooms and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>insert people and people get to absolve </v>

2053
01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:56.330
<v Speaker 6>you of your sins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gives them power.</v>

2054
01:27:56.331 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 6>You build them giant structures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2055
01:27:58.311 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 6>they get the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll money power and if you look at the</v>

2056
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:03.770
<v Speaker 6>history of the Catholic Church,</v>
<v Speaker 6>women as well,</v>

2057
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:08.771
<v Speaker 6>especially in the Middle Ages and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>renaissance going through there and so </v>

2058
01:28:08.771 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 6>they have inserted themselves and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>removed the other mechanism to get there</v>

2059
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:15.971
<v Speaker 6>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they become the intermediaries at a </v>

2060
01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:15.971
<v Speaker 6>certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder,</v>

2061
01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean how much of that is true because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of speculation about,</v>

2062
01:28:17.641 --> 01:28:18.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2063
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.670
<v Speaker 3>where they lost the way and what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really all about.</v>

2064
01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering how much they let the </v>
<v Speaker 3>common people know about it.</v>

2065
01:28:22.921 --> 01:28:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Even back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
01:28:24.241 --> 01:28:25.810
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2067
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elite found out about it and they </v>

2068
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 3>tried to protect the information even </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the common folk,</v>

2069
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:34.110
<v Speaker 3>but also might have been a question of </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change to terence.</v>

2070
01:28:34.111 --> 01:28:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna's had some ideas about that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought that,</v>

2071
01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:39.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the global climate change,</v>

2072
01:28:39.691 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2073
01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 3>very cyclical happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times the climate will be </v>

2074
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.981
<v Speaker 3>inhospitable for mushrooms that changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of getting mushrooms all the </v>

2075
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:49.140
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they can't get them anymore.</v>

2076
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 3>And so then the culture completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes and becomes more of an alcohol </v>

2077
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:56.970
<v Speaker 3>based culture starts off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start using preserved,</v>

2078
01:28:57.050 --> 01:29:02.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms in honey because we know </v>

2079
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>they've been preserving things in honey </v>
<v Speaker 3>for and thousands of years.</v>

2080
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:07.430
<v Speaker 3>And then you deal with fermentation </v>
<v Speaker 3>because honey can become a psychoactive </v>

2081
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 3>substance on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could become mead.</v>

2082
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 3>When it becomes fermented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes like an alcohol.</v>

2083
01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And so then they go into an alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

2084
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:18.081
<v Speaker 3>And then before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mushroom ideas are gone all the </v>

2085
01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:18.081
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2086
01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:22.761
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fellow man that Shit's out the </v>

2087
01:29:22.761 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 3>window and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's just drunk and raping.</v>

2088
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

2089
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:31.910
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you always got to wonder like how </v>

2090
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:34.020
<v Speaker 3>did we get to be who we are now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what was it like?</v>

2091
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if you could go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1400 BC and just go hang around </v>

2092
01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:44.420
<v Speaker 3>England and see what the fuck was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in France and see how people were </v>

2093
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:44.420
<v Speaker 3>living in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2094
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 3>How trippy would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2095
01:29:46.201 --> 01:29:48.150
<v Speaker 3>that'd be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

2096
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>That would be the strangest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to be able to go back in time.</v>

2097
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Even just in like an invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impenetrable capsule.</v>

2098
01:29:56.070 --> 01:30:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Like you could just stand there like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>an invisible phone booth in the middle </v>

2099
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.440
<v Speaker 3>of a town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2100
01:30:01.441 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 3>And you get to watch and they can't walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the phone booth.</v>

2101
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't touch it.</v>

2102
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.240
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>

2103
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:09.910
<v Speaker 5>I've been fascinated by that moment </v>
<v Speaker 5>before battle,</v>

2104
01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you know,</v>

2105
01:30:11.051 --> 01:30:16.051
<v Speaker 5>you just have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have like an ax or you choose </v>

2106
01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:18.631
<v Speaker 5>between an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a morning star and a sword and you're </v>

2107
01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:18.631
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what am I going to use?</v>

2108
01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:20.380
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna maybe make me survive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2109
01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:25.381
<v Speaker 5>like how good is my armor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not as good as that dude's but I'm a </v>

2110
01:30:25.381 --> 01:30:26.740
<v Speaker 5>rocket anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like just feel that.</v>

2111
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:31.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean mma gets an approximation of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think why people love it so much </v>

2112
01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:35.560
<v Speaker 5>because it's the closest we got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it pales in comparison to that,</v>

2113
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:40.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to that moment you're with all of the </v>

2114
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:42.931
<v Speaker 5>people in your country and perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horde that's coming is going to rape </v>

2115
01:30:42.931 --> 01:30:42.931
<v Speaker 5>your girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2116
01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:45.010
<v Speaker 5>kill your children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them into slavery,</v>

2117
01:30:45.011 --> 01:30:48.970
<v Speaker 5>smash their head on and you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just got to fucking hold the ground,</v>

2118
01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how is that?</v>

2119
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:54.460
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know what that's about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>

2120
01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.410
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they did that forever.</v>

2121
01:30:56.530 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 5>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was such a part of the </v>

2122
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 5>human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2123
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:05.550
<v Speaker 5>birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how much of that shit is still in </v>

2124
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.550
<v Speaker 5>our genes and how do you shut that shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it?</v>

2125
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:10.140
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The human hardware is so retro still </v>

2126
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.320
<v Speaker 5>goes on now like any war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing the same thing.</v>

2127
01:31:11.321 --> 01:31:15.100
<v Speaker 5>Like what kind of missiles is this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes different now.</v>

2128
01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.140
<v Speaker 5>It's totally impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2129
01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:20.060
<v Speaker 5>It's so impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know with the call of duty,</v>

2130
01:31:20.061 --> 01:31:25.061
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Soldiers were saying just said call of </v>

2131
01:31:25.061 --> 01:31:27.290
<v Speaker 5>duty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well two wars are going overseas.</v>

2132
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:30.190
<v Speaker 5>What that means like call of duty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means it's all ground game.</v>

2133
01:31:30.191 --> 01:31:35.191
<v Speaker 5>That game is pretty much ground game </v>
<v Speaker 5>going into or explosions and stuff like </v>

2134
01:31:35.191 --> 01:31:35.830
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still going on for is</v>

2135
01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.370
<v Speaker 3>going on and you know what else is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>

2136
01:31:37.371 --> 01:31:42.371
<v Speaker 3>Drones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drones are allowed to go into places </v>

2137
01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:42.920
<v Speaker 3>we're not even really at war with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in Pakistan,</v>

2138
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.230
<v Speaker 3>we're not really supposed to be a war in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan,</v>

2139
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but we got spaceships that are working </v>
<v Speaker 3>on remote control from Nevada.</v>

2140
01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:57.050
<v Speaker 3>They're remote controlling them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada and jacking dudes in Pakistan </v>

2141
01:31:57.381 --> 01:31:58.310
<v Speaker 3>from the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2142
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.610
<v Speaker 5>probably have iphone apps with</v>

2143
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 3>controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tilt it man.</v>

2144
01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:04.190
<v Speaker 3>You can destroy that person by just </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting.</v>

2145
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that movie.</v>

2146
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that movie where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude got really good at that video game </v>

<v Speaker 5>door of once in a while.</v>

2160
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:48.590

<v Speaker 3>to killing.</v>

2171
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:11.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradigm.</v>

2172
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 3>When we were talking before the show </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these guys that had been caught in</v>

2173
01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:19.801
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan that are US soldiers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been killing civilians and taking </v>

2174
01:33:19.801 --> 01:33:22.921
<v Speaker 3>home little trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been playing like a game just </v>

2175
01:33:22.921 --> 01:33:24.910
<v Speaker 3>jacking people and killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just they get to use to killing people,</v>

2176
01:33:24.911 --> 01:33:25.800
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To,</v>

2177
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.950
<v Speaker 3>to used to killing people and to use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a place where everyone presents</v>

2178
01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:31.520
<v Speaker 3>you and they don't want you to be there.</v>

2179
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:34.210
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

2180
01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.420
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time I always would look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

2181
01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:39.490
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at like politicians and go,</v>

2182
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:44.670
<v Speaker 3>how much say do they really have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much state is a president really </v>

2183
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:45.400
<v Speaker 3>have and what the fuck is going on over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2184
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Or is he just a dude with a job just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of us.</v>

2185
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Is it just all bullshit once you get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2186
01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:52.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I used to look at Bush and when,</v>

2187
01:33:52.491 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 3>when Bush was in Iraq and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this motherfucker responsible for</v>

2188
01:33:56.471 --> 01:34:01.471
<v Speaker 3>all these people dying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he responsible for all this talk </v>

2189
01:34:01.471 --> 01:34:04.831
<v Speaker 3>about weapons of mass destruction or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>he just some dude who's got to do this </v>

2190
01:34:04.831 --> 01:34:08.071
<v Speaker 3>job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember when he was standing in </v>

2191
01:34:08.071 --> 01:34:08.760
<v Speaker 3>front of those people and that dude took</v>
<v Speaker 3>off his shoes and through madam.</v>

2192
01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that Shit.</v>

2193
01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I remember that and he ducked and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do through it again and he ducked </v>

2194
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.290
<v Speaker 3>again and he had a little half smile on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his face and I'm like,</v>

2195
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 3>that guy's just a spokesman.</v>

2196
01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I got out of that.</v>

2197
01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I looked at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2198
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:26.581
<v Speaker 3>that is just a dude with a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult job that's not all that bright</v>

2199
01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>and has some ideals and got stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this situation and yeah,</v>

2200
01:34:31.061 --> 01:34:36.061
<v Speaker 3>he's got to say we're going to war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a machine behind that </v>

2201
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:36.061
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not running.</v>

2202
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Shit I'm looking at is duck in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes smiling?</v>

2203
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is not.</v>

2204
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.480
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a care in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not worrying about what happened in</v>

2205
01:34:43.481 --> 01:34:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2206
01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:44.820
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2207
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:47.580
<v Speaker 3>he's just an employee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps it's not as responsibility,</v>

2208
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

2209
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Alex Jones would have a theory </v>

2210
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:57.511
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my favorite part of the whole </v>

2211
01:34:57.511 --> 01:34:57.511
<v Speaker 3>Bush administration was in that through </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the shoes.</v>

2212
01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 3>It was the first time I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I liked Bush,</v>

2213
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I would get angry.</v>

2214
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mother fucker's just bake it a </v>

2215
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.430
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bullshit now.</v>

2216
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2217
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 3>that guy probably gets like four hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep a night.</v>

2218
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.980
<v Speaker 3>What would I be saying if I was speaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people,</v>

2219
01:35:08.981 --> 01:35:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I'd be making up words too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be stumbling.</v>

2220
01:35:11.361 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I'd fuck my words up at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody fucks up.</v>

2221
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:18.550
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama said something about there being </v>

2222
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.550
<v Speaker 3>48 states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2223
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.860
<v Speaker 3>he fucked up the states when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>

2224
01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:20.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people fuckings up all the time.</v>

2225
01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking you're tired all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>You're on this campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

2227
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 3>He's not running shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned like Bush.</v>

2228
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think he's probably right.</v>

2229
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>president until they get in there.</v>

2234
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 3>they open up these doors and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the gears of the universe run.</v>

<v Speaker 3>overpopulation.</v>

2239
01:35:55.670 --> 01:36:00.670
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need to feed them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>camps and we have to make sure that if </v>

<v Speaker 3>fuel.</v>

2247
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:15.340

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:45.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to be honest.</v>

2286
01:37:45.921 --> 01:37:48.650
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't let you get in.</v>

2287
01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:53.860
<v Speaker 3>You got to be full of shit to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought Obama was the first guy that </v>

2288
01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:53.860
<v Speaker 3>wasn't full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2289
01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:58.841
<v Speaker 3>what is.</v>

2291
01:37:58.841 --> 01:37:58.841
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was backing.</v>

2292
01:37:58.841 --> 01:37:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I think you can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you get in.</v>

2293
01:37:59.390 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just a stalemated yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get in.</v>

2294
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:05.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well fuck you.</v>

2295
01:38:05.191 --> 01:38:10.191
<v Speaker 3>No lobbyists and fucking congress and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and that and layers and red tape </v>

2296
01:38:11.161 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 3>and chaos and war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they just tell her when heroin,</v>

2297
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.180
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin coming in by the fucking </v>

2298
01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:20.180
<v Speaker 3>boatload.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the heroin doing?</v>

2299
01:38:20.210 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 3>It's just slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghans need to make a profit.</v>

2300
01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise support this war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2301
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:26.240
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about that on the Alex </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones show.</v>

2302
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:29.580
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about that before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show that there was a Geraldo Rivera was</v>

2303
01:38:29.581 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 3>in Afghanistan talking to this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldier,</v>

2304
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 3>this guy who has a family who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be defending his country and</v>

2305
01:38:36.871 --> 01:38:41.871
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in the poppy fields protecting the </v>

2306
01:38:41.871 --> 01:38:45.351
<v Speaker 3>poppy fields for the afghany farmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in order for the Afghan farmers </v>

2307
01:38:45.351 --> 01:38:48.930
<v Speaker 3>to support the fact that we're over in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan dropping bombs on your moms,</v>

2308
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.320
<v Speaker 3>we have to get this guy's approval and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to allow them to keep producing </v>

2309
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.211
<v Speaker 3>their illegal crop of heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have American soldiers that are </v>

2310
01:38:59.211 --> 01:39:03.351
<v Speaker 3>guarding Afghanistan heroin so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go over there and blow shit up.</v>

2311
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do if your Obama,</v>

2312
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2313
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 3>You get into how you gonna fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough,</v>

2314
01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:17.840
<v Speaker 3>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they figured out that his </v>

2315
01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.430
<v Speaker 3>approval ratings were dropping as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy was tightening up and so they're</v>

2316
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:18.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2317
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:23.810
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just put some more money on the </v>

2318
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.810
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push the ball up,</v>

2319
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 3>and then it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I thought that heroin was helping the</v>

2320
01:39:25.471 --> 01:39:27.090
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say so that heroin,</v>

2321
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is buying heroin retards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2322
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.990
<v Speaker 3>why is oil still like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in California?</v>

2323
01:39:33.991 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Most states right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still cheap.</v>

2324
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Cheaper than it was like five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what you mean?</v>

2325
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 3>When Bush was leaving office then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a fucking a grab,</v>

2326
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:47.961
<v Speaker 3>but don't you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you think it should be like </v>

2327
01:39:47.961 --> 01:39:50.661
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially after that spill and stuff </v>

2328
01:39:50.661 --> 01:39:50.661
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2329
01:39:50.661 --> 01:39:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you just realize or just here </v>

2330
01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.481
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they underestimated Iraqis oil reserve </v>

2331
01:39:56.481 --> 01:39:59.061
<v Speaker 3>by 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 25 percent more oil in Iraq and </v>

2332
01:39:59.061 --> 01:40:00.300
<v Speaker 3>they thought there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Shit,</v>

2333
01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:01.990
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2334
01:40:01.991 --> 01:40:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Get that quote that son fuck a Va.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2335
01:40:05.431 --> 01:40:07.710
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows?</v>

2336
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:12.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they just jacked up all the </v>

2337
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:14.010
<v Speaker 3>prices that they can pay for new plaza </v>
<v Speaker 3>on top of the all the fucking oil.</v>

2338
01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.380
<v Speaker 3>You got to be gotten to like the gas </v>
<v Speaker 3>station.</v>

2339
01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 3>There's like nice plasma tvs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like that and like how does,</v>

2340
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.330
<v Speaker 3>where does this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2341
01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:23.580
<v Speaker 3>$5 a gallon last last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2342
01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering who actually,</v>

2343
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 3>how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2344
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I think actually how it works is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're all in bed together </v>

2345
01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.750
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it's the distributors that</v>

2346
01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 3>set the price and then these oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

2347
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:41.361
<v Speaker 3>like there's a place up the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's owned by these hindus that I go to </v>

2348
01:40:41.361 --> 01:40:42.720
<v Speaker 3>and they have like the ohm on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2349
01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:45.060
<v Speaker 3>this is the oddest place ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sell weed pipes.</v>

2350
01:40:45.061 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we pipes and incense at the counter.</v>

2351
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the oddest place ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys sell petrochemicals.</v>

2352
01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>You sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the real problem,</v>

2353
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:59.370
<v Speaker 3>the reason why we're in war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know the reason why we pollute </v>

2354
01:40:59.370 --> 01:40:59.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's all coming out of this hole </v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

2355
01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 3>And then you get the oam at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think it's them setting the </v>

2356
01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.461
<v Speaker 3>price of the plasmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the companies that sell it </v>

2357
01:41:08.461 --> 01:41:08.461
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

2358
01:41:08.461 --> 01:41:09.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all for free market speculation,</v>

2359
01:41:09.831 --> 01:41:10.750
<v Speaker 5>handles a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2360
01:41:10.751 --> 01:41:13.670
<v Speaker 5>when oil price was dropping there as big</v>
<v Speaker 5>deflationary pressures,</v>

2361
01:41:13.671 --> 01:41:15.440
<v Speaker 5>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gold prices were dropping,</v>

2362
01:41:15.441 --> 01:41:17.330
<v Speaker 5>things were priced because nobody had </v>
<v Speaker 5>any money.</v>

2363
01:41:17.331 --> 01:41:19.400
<v Speaker 5>The speculators weren't able to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gold,</v>

2364
01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:21.800
<v Speaker 5>they were pulling their assets back out </v>
<v Speaker 5>into cash,</v>

2365
01:41:21.801 --> 01:41:26.801
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now things are a little bit looser </v>

2366
01:41:26.801 --> 01:41:27.080
<v Speaker 5>and these commodities have value.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're more worried about inflation now</v>

2367
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:28.640
<v Speaker 5>because obama's push it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2368
01:41:28.641 --> 01:41:33.641
<v Speaker 5>just shoving money into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in an inflationary time then these </v>

2369
01:41:34.041 --> 01:41:36.710
<v Speaker 5>commodities have value.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now we're seeing oil rising.</v>

2370
01:41:36.711 --> 01:41:37.610
<v Speaker 5>We're seeing gold bush.</v>

2371
01:41:38.730 --> 01:41:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one big jump where it went up </v>

2372
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:43.730
<v Speaker 3>to like five bucks a gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the cause of that?</v>

2373
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.030
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2374
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:47.410
<v Speaker 5>I think at that point it was the massive</v>
<v Speaker 5>inflationary concern,</v>

2375
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:48.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there was,</v>

2376
01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:54.120
<v Speaker 5>that money was goIng to lose its value </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that caused the oil to go up in </v>

2377
01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:54.630
<v Speaker 5>price at the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.170
<v Speaker 3>When it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it goes up a barrel,</v>

2379
01:41:56.171 --> 01:41:57.580
<v Speaker 3>does anybody know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know either.</v>

2380
01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian has no idea.</v>

2381
01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>

2382
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:02.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dangerous.</v>

2383
01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:07.150
<v Speaker 5>It's ninja set the price in Japan on </v>
<v Speaker 5>friendly dolphins and there's certain,</v>

2384
01:42:07.151 --> 01:42:12.151
<v Speaker 5>there's certain supply and demand </v>
<v Speaker 5>factors involved in the oil but as well </v>

2385
01:42:12.151 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 5>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on a macro level,</v>

2386
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's all about generally </v>
<v Speaker 5>inflation.</v>

2387
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.920
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed very suspicious to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was the end of the bush </v>

2388
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.651
<v Speaker 3>administration and administration that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was clearly under the influence of big </v>

2389
01:42:23.651 --> 01:42:24.740
<v Speaker 3>oil and then at the very end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>

2390
01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.640
<v Speaker 3>everything just gets</v>

2391
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.700
<v Speaker 5>delta twist to pay his tab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2392
01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.280
<v Speaker 5>It was true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was true red line.</v>

2393
01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.300
<v Speaker 3>They were going to red line as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money out of the system as they could </v>

2394
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.900
<v Speaker 3>until the new administration came into </v>
<v Speaker 3>play on how much,</v>

2395
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:42.930
<v Speaker 3>how much control does the president or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the administration really have and how </v>

2396
01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:44.540
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they have any at all?</v>

2397
01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.560
<v Speaker 3>It's all gotta be set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they're going let some </v>

2398
01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.991
<v Speaker 3>new dude come in every four years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just rerun shit like why would we do </v>

2399
01:42:51.991 --> 01:42:52.900
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know the career guys,</v>

2400
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:54.310
<v Speaker 3>the very top of the heap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've already.</v>

2401
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:56.820
<v Speaker 3>We got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got no.</v>

2402
01:42:57.350 --> 01:43:01.280
<v Speaker 5>Well opec supposedly sets how much the </v>
<v Speaker 5>available reserves there are and kind of</v>

2403
01:43:01.281 --> 01:43:02.310
<v Speaker 5>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how much is it?</v>

2404
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that is speculation now who knows</v>

2405
01:43:04.731 --> 01:43:06.710
<v Speaker 5>how much they know and what they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

2406
01:43:06.711 --> 01:43:11.711
<v Speaker 5>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an interesting game with a lot of </v>

2407
01:43:11.711 --> 01:43:11.711
<v Speaker 5>money at stake when you have that much </v>
<v Speaker 5>money at stake,</v>

2408
01:43:11.711 --> 01:43:14.870
<v Speaker 5>you could be buck sure that people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out a way to fuck it.</v>

2409
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:20.420
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty amazing what it's done now </v>

2410
01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:20.420
<v Speaker 3>because if it wasn't for oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no plastic.</v>

2411
01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.020
<v Speaker 3>There'd be no computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be no nothing.</v>

2412
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:24.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the shit that we make today.</v>

2413
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:25.980
<v Speaker 3>No flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no flashlights.</v>

2414
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Especially flashlight is actually made </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of oil.</v>

2415
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:33.300
<v Speaker 3>This shit has to come out of the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>as oil before you can fuck it.</v>

2416
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mostly mineral oil,</v>

2417
01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 5>food grade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mineral,</v>

2418
01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:38.000
<v Speaker 5>a primary component</v>

2419
01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:40.620
<v Speaker 3>and food grade mineral oil comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground,</v>

2420
01:43:40.621 --> 01:43:41.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

2421
01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.210
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

2422
01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:44.580
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where does it mean?</v>

2423
01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't it all come from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:51.200
<v Speaker 5>I think it actually might come from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably know</v>

2425
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't come from fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you make a flashlight?</v>

2426
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 3>That official.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Al will be nasty.</v>

2427
01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.430
<v Speaker 3>That would be more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dirty fucking deep flashlight.</v>

2428
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some dudes just missed stinky </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

2429
01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:08.531
<v Speaker 3>All the only time they got laid as by </v>
<v Speaker 3>slots and just drunk pigs and that's </v>

2430
01:44:08.531 --> 01:44:11.680
<v Speaker 3>what gives me a hard on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a good mood.</v>

2431
01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.200
<v Speaker 5>There's a product that came out actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>called the vulva and what they've done,</v>

2432
01:44:17.201 --> 01:44:21.190
<v Speaker 5>they sell it for 40 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gagging already 40 bucks and it's like a</v>

2433
01:44:21.191 --> 01:44:24.040
<v Speaker 5>little perfume vial that supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 5>smells like pussy.</v>

2434
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:30.490
<v Speaker 5>So obviously being in the business that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we ordered some fast around a smell and </v>

2435
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't quite get there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it kind of smells like is like </v>

2436
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 5>a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2437
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.190
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's way closer to that.</v>

2438
01:44:39.191 --> 01:44:41.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like post condoms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweaty sex,</v>

2439
01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:49.890
<v Speaker 5>sweat and rubber has like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this.</v>

2440
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would anybody want to sell stinky </v>

2441
01:44:59.980 --> 01:44:59.980
<v Speaker 3>pussy smell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

2442
01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:04.760
<v Speaker 3>We used to send ours with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with like knife to spread on your </v>

2443
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:04.770

<v Speaker 3>But now all flashlights come on.</v>

2444
01:45:04.771 --> 01:45:09.771
<v Speaker 3>So I always wonder how much fart porn is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for show how much of dudes who are </v>

<v Speaker 3>and dudes miles and they're beating off </v>

<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that for show or is that just fire </v>

2448

<v Speaker 5>there likes it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least familiar for sure.</v>

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 5>He's one guy out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loves every,</v>

2454
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:29.880

01:45:29.881 --> 01:45:32.940
<v Speaker 5>whether their feet or whether it's shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think someone's mommy was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and this repression gets all twisted up </v>

2458
01:45:41.241 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden all they want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do to get a boner is barred on </v>

2459
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.250

2479
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:34.341
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they do not compare it to the ass.</v>

2482
