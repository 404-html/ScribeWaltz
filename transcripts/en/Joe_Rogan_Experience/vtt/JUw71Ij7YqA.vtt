<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience every fucking show I do.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>People will yell out to every show,</v>

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.121
<v Speaker 1>every show,</v>

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but fucking if people are yelling shit out.</v>

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.533
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.831
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

7
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I never even really did.</v>

8
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I have talked about it on stage a few times,</v>

9
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

10
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I heard the audio.</v>

12
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>You talked about the time that you and I did it where I thought you were going</v>

13
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:22.694
<v Speaker 1>to die,</v>

14
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>but every fucking show,</v>

15
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>like it was like my closing bit for years.</v>

16
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.841
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

17
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>there was one of the weirdest psychedelic situations for the folks at home.</v>

19
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Doug and I were doing the man show and it was like in the death throes,</v>

21
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't right here we was,</v>

23
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>we had to spend all night writing,</v>

24
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to save the fucking thing.</v>

25
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>We knew it was a disaster.</v>

26
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:43.351
<v Speaker 1>We got fucked.</v>

27
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:43.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

29
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

30
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>we both appreciate the fact that everybody was disappointed by how that show</v>

31
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

32
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but no one was more disappointed than we were.</v>

33
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was a mess.</v>

34
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And when we don't need to get into details,</v>

35
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.243
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

36
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.520

<v Speaker 1>no it's fine.</v>

40
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

41
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible show but there was some great shit in it.</v>

42
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I defy anybody to watch the uh,</v>

43
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>my midget sketch.</v>

44
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>

45
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.403
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

46
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Another man's mentioned it cause your,</v>

47
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>your sketch a defy anybody to watch that and tell me that's not hilarious.</v>

48
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Where are you trying to steal the old midget from the man show?</v>

49
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Bring him over to the new head shot with us.</v>

50
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a,</v>

51
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it was the wrong thing at the time because our show is not,</v>

52
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the learning experience was priceless cause that was my first real television</v>

53
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>and just knowing how they fuck it up.</v>

54
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.611
<v Speaker 1>We could have,</v>

55
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>we could have done something on the Internet,</v>

56
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>we've could have done something like Internet style where there was no input</v>

57
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and we could have had a great fucking time.</v>

58
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

59
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

60
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>when they came to me with the idea,</v>

61
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the idea was we're going to have nudity,</v>

62
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll blur it out immediately.</v>

63
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking Joey d is going to be naked.</v>

64
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>The beginning of every fucking show is just telling someone about that.</v>

65
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

66
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>and then I said,</v>

67
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

68
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and what about swears?</v>

69
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And they said you could bleep it out and bleep out,</v>

70
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>talk about whatever you want.</v>

71
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

72
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing if we get sued,</v>

73
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>this is what stone Stanley guys telling me.</v>

74
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.251
<v Speaker 1>If we get sued,</v>

75
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing.</v>

76
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

77
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>we aren't gonna Fuck Shit Up.</v>

78
00:01:59.221 --> 00:01:59.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

79
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm just can't wait for abortion monologues and chaos.</v>

80
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>And when we got in there,</v>

81
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a totally different story.</v>

82
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we got in and the audience wouldn't have liked it any better.</v>

83
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>they would've still hated it,</v>

85
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't have had to fuck,</v>

86
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>we would've had two bags on our heads.</v>

87
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>We would have had to rebuild and make a new audience.</v>

88
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You know there,</v>

89
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>there's one point in time with John Stewart didn't use to host the daily show.</v>

90
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

91
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>people forgot there was that other guy and it really,</v>

93
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have called it demand show.</v>

94
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>We should have said,</v>

95
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>we are really into the idea of taking over that time slot or that idea that</v>

96
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>doing this new [inaudible] had told us to pound sand probably it'll fuck</v>

97
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:32.241
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

98
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>We might know.</v>

99
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

100

101
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>They were convinced that that name was going to sell everything and that was</v>

102
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>going to be the big push and there's name brand.</v>

103
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:38.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

104
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>it's said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>When Doug and I were on the Mancho,</v>

147
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I know we complained,</v>

148
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

149
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>this is pure evidence.</v>

150
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.690
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

151
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>that was the best story.</v>

152
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>

153
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

154
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>we had a game show that we created called make me hard and it was,</v>

155
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the best things we did when it actually turned out.</v>

156
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why it was one of the best things we ever did is uh,</v>

157
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>because it was tranny caucus trainee cock.</v>

158
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

160
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:02.881
<v Speaker 1>we the,</v>

161
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the show's called make me hard and then when we actually made the show and when</v>

162
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.171
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

163
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:08.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>talk to the comedy central people in every,</v>

165
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.171
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like hard,</v>

166
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>hard was too dangerous.</v>

167
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to be make me stiff and we were like,</v>

168
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is the difference is the most,</v>

169

<v Speaker 1>this was right before we're about to tape to art department has to rush.</v>

170
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.570
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>they allowed fucking full open tranny cock open tranny cock cause we're going to</v>

172
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>blur it out.</v>

173
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Simulated fellatio on a banana by a midget.</v>

174
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.551
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>

175
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>All the language.</v>

176
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:34.781
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

177
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:35.614
<v Speaker 1>this was the Gig,</v>

178
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid,</v>

179
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>they would strap him to a chair and they would put it this harness back up</v>

180
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people probably don't remember,</v>

181
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>make me laugh,</v>

182
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>was a game show where people tried not to laugh while comics try to make other</v>

183
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>guys would get in their face and say silly things.</v>

184
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>So make me hard.</v>

185
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>We set them up.</v>

186
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Where would they have this box on their package and we would decide when it lit</v>

187
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>up indicating that they had an erection.</v>

188
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.351
<v Speaker 1>So we had,</v>

189
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>so they had to try to not get a boner during these sexual,</v>

190
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

191
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>so of course it would go off,</v>

192
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>midgets would eat bananas.</v>

193
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>It would go off and we had this really hot tranny.</v>

194
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>She was so hot that Eddie Bravo and I were at the comedy store one night and we</v>

195
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>were coming down and we got to park at the high end at the comedy store.</v>

196
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Parking lot was full and we were coming down the ramp and she was coming up at</v>

<v Speaker 1>And she's totally believable.</v>

208
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.030

209
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.500

223
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:52.631

224
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

225
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.170
<v Speaker 1>her name was vanity and you can find her like,</v>

226
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's vanity.</v>

227
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Ts you Google.</v>

228
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I've founded a short of people who'd,</v>

229
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.243
<v Speaker 1>who'd blame him?</v>

230
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.331
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

231
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:02.571
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

232
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:02.781
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

233
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

234
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the guys,</v>

235
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 1>strapped to this table and she climbs all over him and he's,</v>

237
00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:08.511
<v Speaker 1>he licked her tits.</v>

238
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:09.344
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

239
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.611
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

240
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Poor fucking guy.</v>

241
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>We tortured this guy's memory forever.</v>

242
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.301
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

243
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:14.751
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

244
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.584
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going,</v>

245
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

246
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.333
<v Speaker 1>People cheering.</v>

248
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And then she pulls out this trainee deck that looks like,</v>

249
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>like a poison monkey Dick.</v>

250
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what it look like.</v>

251
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It looks sick.</v>

252
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>He'd been hitting so many female hormones.</v>

253
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It was like an old man in a wheelchair.</v>

254
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.713
<v Speaker 1>That's what it takes.</v>

255
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>And she pulled it out and it was black.</v>

256
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>It was black as it functional or is it just a bunch of snow?</v>

257
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

258
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>

259
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 1>It's all done.</v>

260
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:39.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

261
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just hanging on shell,</v>

262
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but it feels good when you suck it still.</v>

263
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.161
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

264
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:43.371
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

265
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Even a soft dick feels good if you suck it right.</v>

266
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think,</v>

267
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.791
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any,</v>

268
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>unless she pops viagara maybe she can pop the Agora and I still have a hard day.</v>

269
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

270
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking human being.</v>
