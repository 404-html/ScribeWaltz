00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast was one of the episodes that we</v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>made while we were filming the Scifi show.</v>

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan questions everything.</v>

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So what we did when we did that show,</v>

5
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen or heard of it,</v>

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>we had a podcast on the show and a lot of people thought it was a fake podcast,</v>

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually a real podcast and thanks to the generosity of the Scifi</v>

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:21.631
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>we are now able to release it as a podcast.</v>

10
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>So a thank you to Tim and Wayne,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like the way we did it.</v>

18
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.491
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a,</v>

19
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>it was really fun to do it this way.</v>

20
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>We did it exactly like a regular podcast,</v>

21
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>just me and Duncan.</v>

22
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And in this episode we went over what's called a biohacking or um,</v>

23
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

24
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>what I call dorks with knives sticking things under their skin.</v>

25
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating subject and uh,</v>

26
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll enjoy the shit out of it.</v>

27
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>This episode is brought to you by legal zoom.</v>

28
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Legal Zoom is a one of the sponsors that we have where we have actually many</v>

29
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>people that are connected to the show have used it on,</v>

30
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it was formulated through legal zoom.</v>

31
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

32
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>made his company in LLC through legal zoom.</v>

34
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a way you can do things online where you can get legal papers filed and do</v>

35
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>things without actually having to go to an attorney and sit down and,</v>

36
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>pay for an office visit and pay exorbitant amounts of money to an attorney.</v>

38
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>And also you have to have a schedule shit and drive and all that jazz.</v>

39
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You can use legal zoom naked.</v>

40
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.063
<v Speaker 1>You could be naked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you could make it a point to only use legal zoom when you're naked and won't</v>

45
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:56.421
<v Speaker 1>have any benefit or any detriment to the actual legal legality of the papers</v>

46
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

47
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.003

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.960
<v Speaker 2>my dad beat up my friend's dad from in college.</v>

148
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.400
<v Speaker 2>But when did this happen?</v>

149
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.370
<v Speaker 2>This was w w the the assault happened.</v>

150
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

151
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I think before me and this guy were in college together.</v>

152
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the probability of getting a ride back from college with a</v>

153
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 2>guy who was immobile,</v>

154
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.360
<v Speaker 2>the probability of your dad having beaten his dad up,</v>

155
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.340
<v Speaker 2>it's so slim.</v>

156
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It's so slim that like my,</v>

157
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.600
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds that my,</v>

158
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.440
<v Speaker 2>that we both go to this liberal arts college of 500 students and the one other</v>

159
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:31.101
<v Speaker 2>guy from mobile,</v>

160
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Alabama,</v>

161
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>his father had been assaulted by my father and a bar.</v>

162
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Those are pretty small and minuscule odds.</v>

163
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.780
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny too that it would be your dad too because you're like the</v>

164
00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:42.614
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

165
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I could never imagine you just assaulting someone.</v>

166
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Even if somebody got really mad at you,</v>

167
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:47.091
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

168
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:47.361
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

169
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>well fuck you man.</v>

170
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And you just like get out of there.</v>

171
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>The idea of you assaulting someone is beyond comprehension.</v>

172
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of your dad being this fucking tooth bullet</v>

173
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 4>and savage beating the fuck out of your friend's dad getting arrested.</v>

174
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ got arrested in the parking lot.</v>

175
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Two cops took him down and he kind of,</v>

176
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.220
<v Speaker 4>my dad</v>

177
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>came home from high school once with a black eye,</v>

178
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.201
<v Speaker 2>him and his,</v>

179
00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.831
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

181
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:15.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.910
<v Speaker 2>coworker,</v>

183
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.540
<v Speaker 2>they were doing a business together and the business started going bad.</v>

184
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They got the fucking fist fight and he came home and I remember looking at him,</v>

185
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like 16 or 17 or something like that in a blackout.</v>

186
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.751
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

187
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.190
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man,</v>

188
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>are you done with this?</v>

189
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.370
<v Speaker 4>You're still duking it out,</v>

190
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

191
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.451
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

192
00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:33.040
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell will heal old.</v>

193
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:33.761
<v Speaker 4>He was back then.</v>

194
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a classic.</v>

195
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a classic.</v>

196
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.510
<v Speaker 4>It's a classic man.</v>

197
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.201
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

198
00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:39.280
<v Speaker 4>A classic man.</v>

199
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

200
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.003
<v Speaker 4>Like it was like,</v>

201
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.010
<v Speaker 4>like thinking a Hemingway.</v>

202
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 4>That's what's just part of being a man.</v>

203
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like you would get in it some inevitable fistfight and in those days it</v>

204
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 4>seems like you don't get in a fist fight and there's lawsuits and legal staff.</v>

205
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 4>It's just like the other guy excepts getting his ass kicked.</v>

206
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:57.040
<v Speaker 4>You're the victor and that's it.</v>

207
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Or you get your ass kicked and you forget about it.</v>

208
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 4>That seems like the old way.</v>

209
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:01.211
<v Speaker 4>It is now.</v>

210
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 4>If you get in a fist fight,</v>

211
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you end up in,</v>

212
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:03.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

213
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.200
<v Speaker 4>a serious legal trouble,</v>

214
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 4>you get all the instant lawsuit.</v>

215
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 4>But it was used to just be like,</v>

216
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 4>when you see elk smashing into each other in the wilderness,</v>

217
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 4>that's what it used to be.</v>

218
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:14.321
<v Speaker 4>Being a man.</v>

219
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 4>You would just run into a guy and just start punching each other.</v>

220
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 4>And then with it,</v>

221
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 4>those were the days back in the good old days before writing shit down</v>

222
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.743
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

223
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 4>people had a few mistakes,</v>

224
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 2>just started writing shit down.</v>

225
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

226
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

227
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.810
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

228
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

229
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>blame it on a Robbie Robbie's fault.</v>

230
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And that gentleman is,</v>

231
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 2>his name is Sharon,</v>

232
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Sharon,</v>

233
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Sharon,</v>

234
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Sharon,</v>

235

<v Speaker 2>Sharon and Lucas.</v>

236
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And they're from a grindhouse wetware and grindhouse wetware.</v>

237
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

238
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.420
<v Speaker 2>greatest name for a competent,</v>

239
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.263
<v Speaker 2>amazing ever.</v>

240
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.643
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

241
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

242
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>so it comes from the name,</v>

243
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.911
<v Speaker 2>grinders.</v>

245
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what we get real close to that.</v>

246
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

247
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.101
<v Speaker 2>that's what we are.</v>

248
00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:58.934
<v Speaker 2>We're grinders.</v>

249
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Grinders are kind of like a,</v>

250
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you make open source hackers and body modification with a dash</v>

251
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:06.344
<v Speaker 2>of transhumanism.</v>

252
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

253
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 2>and what wears a is this,</v>

254
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:11.804
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

256
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 2>So we're literally grinding our biology.</v>

257
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.880
<v Speaker 2>There's all these interesting little names that you guys have for yourself.</v>

258
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Close fall grinders.</v>

259
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 2>We're grinders,</v>

260
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 2>we're transhumanists where there's a lot of uh,</v>

261
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>self defining going on there.</v>

262
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

263
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.220
<v Speaker 5>it's not exactly that we're self defining.</v>

264
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:36.900
<v Speaker 5>We're just guys who we really liked technology and we all grew up with like you</v>

265
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:41.901
<v Speaker 5>talk about growing up with Hemingway and classic men and we were all about</v>

266
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:42.540
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

267
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 5>We grew up,</v>

268
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.711
<v Speaker 5>we were,</v>

269
00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.220
<v Speaker 5>we were protected and sheltered and grew up with star wars and grew up with</v>

270
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.740
<v Speaker 5>these stories about robots I could think.</v>

271
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 5>And people that couldn't live any longer and had to augment themselves and</v>

272
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 5>cyborgs and well,</v>

273
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 5>cyborgs were really cool.</v>

274
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 5>We thought they were really cool.</v>

275
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.481
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

276
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

277
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:06.021
<v Speaker 5>I was in my twenties when we hit the year 2001st thing that happened,</v>

278
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 5>New Year's Eve,</v>

279
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.760
<v Speaker 5>2000 and after I got over the shock of nothing hitting the wall,</v>

280
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 5>nothing falling out of the sky,</v>

281
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 5>I turned to my brother and went,</v>

282
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 5>where is my fucking jet pack?</v>

283
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 5>And that kind of summed it up.</v>

284
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 5>I felt that way.</v>

285
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

286
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 5>my buddy's felt that way.</v>

287
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize it,</v>

288
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 5>but there were a lot of people who felt that way.</v>

289
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.711
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

290
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

291
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 5>we were all broke and we didn't know much about science.</v>

292
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

293
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.133
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

294
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line,</v>

295
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 5>like I guess in 2006,</v>

296
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.711
<v Speaker 5>there was a kid in Arizona who realized that he could start stimulating his</v>

297
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 5>nerves with magnets,</v>

298
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 5>with magnetic implants.</v>

299
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.911
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

300
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:48.271
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

301
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 5>went to a body mog guide and got an implant done in his fingers.</v>

302
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 5>It started going from him to a guy in Europe.</v>

303
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 5>And then like 2008,</v>

304
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:58.520
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>

305
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

306
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 5>lady Quinn Norton,</v>

307
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

308
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.380
<v Speaker 5>who wrote for wired and wrote for some other or other places.</v>

309
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:05.214
<v Speaker 5>And she did it.</v>

310
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 5>She went out and said it was a bad idea.</v>

311
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.150
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>

312
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.983
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

313
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.410
<v Speaker 5>other people started doing it.</v>

314
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

315
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.743
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

316
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.683
<v Speaker 1>let's back up.</v>

317
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.191
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

318
00:10:13.191 --> 00:10:14.480
<v Speaker 1>explain what you're talking about.</v>

319
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about bio hacking,</v>

320
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>talking about doing something to your body that enhances it in integrating,</v>

321
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.190
<v Speaker 1>incorporating technology into your body.</v>

322
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And the first guy was the guy in Phoenix that did the Arizona rather was at</v>

323
00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:27.021
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

324
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Was it Phoenix,</v>

325
00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Arizona?</v>

326
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 1>They did the magnets and its fingers.</v>

328
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.671
<v Speaker 1>As far as we know,</v>

329
00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the first,</v>

330
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:33.354
<v Speaker 1>the pioneer.</v>

331
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.400
<v Speaker 1>As far as first document,</v>

332
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.030
<v Speaker 1>what benefit is there of having magnets in your fingers?</v>

333
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

334
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.010
<v Speaker 1>what did that accomplish for him besides making it easier to put your hand on a</v>

335
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:43.844
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator</v>

336
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:45.731
<v Speaker 5>easier?</v>

337
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 5>I think it's annoying.</v>

338
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm being annoying moment.</v>

339
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 5>You're always getting stuck to things.</v>

340
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

341
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.260
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't exactly work like that.</v>

342
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 5>These are really tiny magnets.</v>

343
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Magnets in your fingers.</v>

344
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:56.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

345
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

346
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:58.061
<v Speaker 5>I got like,</v>

347
00:10:58.061 --> 00:10:58.894
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

348
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 5>got wound around there.</v>

349
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.190
<v Speaker 5>One around there.</v>

350
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

351
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

352
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>so you implanted magnets in your fingers?</v>

353
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.663
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you do that?</v>

355
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.291
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

356
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.124
<v Speaker 5>I was drunk.</v>

357
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.430
<v Speaker 5>No kidding,</v>

358
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.940
<v Speaker 5>kidding.</v>

359
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

360
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I uh,</v>

361
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.310
<v Speaker 5>found out about this.</v>

362
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:18.490
<v Speaker 5>I was really interested in everything we've been talking about.</v>

363
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 5>I ran into a childhood friend of mine who got it done last year and when he</v>

364
00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:25.690
<v Speaker 5>showed me what he was doing with it,</v>

365
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.040
<v Speaker 5>I had to do it.</v>

366
00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:27.874
<v Speaker 5>What was he doing with it?</v>

367
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.893
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

368
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.580
<v Speaker 5>it gives you the ability when you implant a magnet in the nerve dance area of</v>

369
00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:37.060
<v Speaker 5>your hand when you are around an electromagnetic field,</v>

370
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

371
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.890
<v Speaker 5>that magnet vibrates.</v>

372
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.810
<v Speaker 5>And so you can feel that now there is a property of our brains called</v>

373
00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:44.800
<v Speaker 5>neuroplasticity.</v>

374
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

375
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.210
<v Speaker 5>when you provide a stimulus over a course of time,</v>

376
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.673
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

377
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 5>like about six months,</v>

378
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 5>your brain starts to it,</v>

379
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 5>it starts building something new.</v>

380
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:56.981
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

381
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:57.251
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

382
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I was always fascinated even as a child of a,</v>

383
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 5>the idea of having an extra sense,</v>

384
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily like ESP,</v>

385
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 5>but just an extra sense or be able to hear a sound that no one's ever heard</v>

386
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

387
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.323
<v Speaker 5>Is he a color?</v>

388
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 5>No one ever seen before.</v>

389
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 5>All those stories from a don't do drug pamphlets that were like,</v>

390
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 5>I can see the music,</v>

391
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 5>I can taste sound.</v>

392
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 5>That sounded amazing to me.</v>

393
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 5>So when I heard about this extra sense,</v>

394
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 5>I jumped at the chance to incorporate that in my body.</v>

395
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 5>But what extra cents,</v>

396
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 5>the extra sense of using these magnets to detect and electrical field or to</v>

397
00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:33.710
<v Speaker 5>vibrate during an electrical field?</v>

398
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying?</v>

399
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

400
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 5>How would you define an electrical field?</v>

401
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.133
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

402
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 5>it's our station.</v>

403
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.300
<v Speaker 5>It's an electromagnetic field.</v>

404
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 5>So anytime that an electron travels in a straight line,</v>

405
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:45.791
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

406
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 5>you have a magnetic field that's coming out kind of in a circle around it</v>

407
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 5>radiates around it.</v>

408
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

409
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 5>if you have a coil,</v>

410
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 5>a coil of wire and the electrons going through a coil,</v>

411
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 5>there'll be kind of like a doughnut shape,</v>

412
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 5>magnetic field around it.</v>

413
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 5>So those sorts of fields,</v>

414
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 5>they have property of a volume and property of frequency.</v>

415
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 5>They vibrate at a certain,</v>

416
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.460
<v Speaker 5>certain frequency and they're loud or soft like a transformer.</v>

417
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:15.131
<v Speaker 5>Like we'll watch,</v>

418
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:15.701
<v Speaker 5>we'll transplant.</v>

419
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 5>We have a building that absolutely.</v>

420
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.830
<v Speaker 5>So if you were near that with your fingers having the magnets in them,</v>

421
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 5>what would happen to you?</v>

422
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

423
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I can feel those sometimes.</v>

424
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

425
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 5>when people would ask me at the beginning what it was like to feel this stuff,</v>

426
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.770
<v Speaker 5>I would describe it like an effort of effervescent feeling like bubbles if felt</v>

427
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:35.944
<v Speaker 5>like bubbles.</v>

428
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.100
<v Speaker 5>And it was really interesting to me.</v>

429
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 5>It felt like bubbles.</v>

430
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

431
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 5>Like how does that work?</v>

432
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

433
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.910
<v Speaker 5>it's the weirdest explanation for some of that or description.</v>

434
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

435
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.963
<v Speaker 5>felt like bubbles.</v>

436
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what to say.</v>

437
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

438
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.253
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like fists,</v>

439
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 5>like pop tarts,</v>

440
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:52.323
<v Speaker 5>pop rocks runner.</v>

441
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.060
<v Speaker 5>Seafoam I think his wedding,</v>

442
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

443
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 5>Froth like dog froth.</v>

444
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.280
<v Speaker 5>Every person that has the implant uses completely different language.</v>

445
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 5>It's been really fascinating to run into other people with implants and talk</v>

446
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 5>about this stuff because we are describing the same phenomena and it's like</v>

447
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 5>you're asking me to describe a color that you've never seen before.</v>

448
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 5>How am I going to describe squad?</v>

449
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

450
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 5>it's squat.</v>

451
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.333
<v Speaker 5>Was that blue?</v>

452
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:18.761
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

453
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 5>it's squat is a purple.</v>

454
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.531
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

455
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:20.831
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

456
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:21.970
<v Speaker 5>it's like a tasting.</v>

457
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 5>An orange.</v>

458
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.721
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

459
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 5>so it's orange?</v>

460
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.243
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

461
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Is there any negative repercussions to having these magnets installed in your</v>

462
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:28.340
<v Speaker 5>body?</v>

463
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

464
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:28.991
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

465
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 5>the first time that someone actually said something that made sense as far as a</v>

466
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:33.934
<v Speaker 5>negative thing,</v>

467
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 5>I saw a speech by Quinn Norton where she said,</v>

468
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:36.881
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

469
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:37.541
<v Speaker 5>don't do this.</v>

470
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 5>This is a bad idea.</v>

471
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

472
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 5>hers shattered.</v>

473
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.621
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

474
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:44.650
<v Speaker 5>Shattered her magnetic implant shattered.</v>

475
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 5>Shattered.</v>

476
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:45.671
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

477
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:50.671
<v Speaker 5>So when a a magnet receives either a lot of heat or a very strong force,</v>

478
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

479
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 5>it loses its magnetic pole.</v>

480
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 5>But more importantly,</v>

481
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 5>these magnets are made out of rare earth elements.</v>

482
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 5>Mine's like a cobalt a alloy.</v>

483
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.190
<v Speaker 5>Those things aren't really healthy to take inside your body if it shatters.</v>

484
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.390
<v Speaker 5>So this is paralleling,</v>

485
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 5>coded.</v>

486
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Some people use silicone,</v>

487
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.303
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

488
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 5>crazier people use hot glue.</v>

489
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

490
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 5>and yeah,</v>

491
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 2>so it's essentially,</v>

492
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:14.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

493
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>it's poison.</v>

494
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.181
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

495
00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a toxic.</v>

496
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

497
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>So body when it's not covered,</v>

498
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.310
<v Speaker 5>when a Burstyn in her,</v>

499
00:15:23.311 --> 00:15:27.900
<v Speaker 5>she actually consulted a doctor and the doctor was like,</v>

500
00:15:27.901 --> 00:15:28.111
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

501
00:15:28.111 --> 00:15:28.944
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

502
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.440
<v Speaker 5>We could go through all the trouble of pulling it out,</v>

503
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's so tiny and it's so little that's really not going to bother you.</v>

504
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.500
<v Speaker 5>And so they left it in and over the course of time,</v>

505
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.140
<v Speaker 5>that magnet pulled itself back together.</v>

506
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 5>She never got the sense back,</v>

507
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.310
<v Speaker 5>but it pulled itself back together.</v>

508
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.910
<v Speaker 2>What's in it didn't harm her.</v>

510
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Creepy little creature.</v>

511
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.410
<v Speaker 2>If you guys are interested moving around inside of her family,</v>

512
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.161
<v Speaker 2>she break it.</v>

513
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:56.560
<v Speaker 2>What'd she slap?</v>

514
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.910
<v Speaker 2>A cop car or something?</v>

515
00:15:57.911 --> 00:15:58.440
<v Speaker 2>How would you,</v>

516
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.310
<v Speaker 2>how did she shadowed?</v>

517
00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:01.270
<v Speaker 2>She didn't say serious masturbation.</v>

518
00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

519
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:07.261
<v Speaker 2>Just furious possessed eyes rolled back one shoe on screening.</v>

520
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

521
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.680
<v Speaker 2>like a tiger cotton.</v>

522
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.100
<v Speaker 2>A Barb wire fence.</v>

523
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.443
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it wasn't.</v>

524
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

525
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.350
<v Speaker 2>it could be cool.</v>

526
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what happened if I had to guess,</v>

527
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but that usually doesn't happen with,</v>

528
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.380
<v Speaker 2>with the magnets this size,</v>

529
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.560
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a vagina,</v>

530
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.460
<v Speaker 2>so I wouldn't know.</v>

531
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>How could you know what would happen when a woman's in the middle of a furious</v>

532
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:34.420
<v Speaker 2>masturbation session</v>

533
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.490
<v Speaker 2>on thick fucking half a pound of meth?</v>

534
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Just slamming it home.</v>

535
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.983
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

536
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Are you asking how can we imagine what happened?</v>

537
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I can get shattered.</v>

538
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.480
<v Speaker 2>That's just a good a guess as any.</v>

539
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

540
00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Speaker 2>like maybe her orgasm was so strong.</v>

541
00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:55.030
<v Speaker 2>It admitted and magnetic field mashed up.</v>

542
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Horny as fuck.</v>

543
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe on top of an old truck in the middle.</v>

544
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm just coming up with a scenario.</v>

545
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 2>How do you did these are under,</v>

546
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.050
<v Speaker 2>these are under your fingers.</v>

547
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:08.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

548
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot larger.</v>

549
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.160
<v Speaker 2>But if you guys are curious to cock magnet.</v>

550
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

551
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

552
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:13.901
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

553
00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:15.250
<v Speaker 2>So I need something for your cock.</v>

554
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 2>That's neat.</v>

555
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:17.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

556
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.260
<v Speaker 2>just in a cleaner way of expressing this question.</v>

557
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

558
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.740
<v Speaker 2>are there any gentleman perhaps that,</v>

559
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.530
<v Speaker 2>have these magnets putting their nether regions?</v>

561
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

562
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

563
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:28.991
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

564
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It's been spoken about.</v>

565
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>It's been spoken.</v>

566
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Has it been smoking or has it been written on our website somewhere?</v>

567
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.933
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

568
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 2>it's been spoken about and you close,</v>

569
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:39.850
<v Speaker 2>you can get that to your face to see the better.</v>

570
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.100
<v Speaker 2>You should live right up to your face usually,</v>

571
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

572
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.670
<v Speaker 2>or move your chair a little bit when it comes to stuff like that.</v>

573
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>People talk about it and then,</v>

574
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and then don't do,</v>

575
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.011
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

576
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:50.521
<v Speaker 2>so they're saying,</v>

577
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

578
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 2>but thinking about putting magnets in my car,</v>

579
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 2>just so you started thinking about their cock,</v>

580
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.643
<v Speaker 2>is that what they're doing?</v>

581
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing is and the,</v>

582
00:17:57.441 --> 00:17:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and then your forest,</v>

583
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:58.691
<v Speaker 2>hate me.</v>

584
00:17:58.691 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

585

593
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 2>that's too easy.</v>

594
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:12.601

<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

603
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:26.911
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>

604
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

605

<v Speaker 2>I've seen allegedly seen some stuff online and just horrible ideas.</v>

611
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.890
<v Speaker 2>You know that someone followed through with drunk splits,</v>

612
00:18:41.891 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 2>his cock and the guy.</v>

613

<v Speaker 2>Only one guy that's like saying big foot's only one thing.</v>

614
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of big foot.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to feel phenomenal,</v>

618
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:55.451
<v Speaker 4>I suppose.</v>

619
00:18:55.451 --> 00:18:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it fall apart when you're having to go hot dog that's been sliced and</v>

620
00:18:58.961 --> 00:18:59.794
<v Speaker 4>thrown on the grill?</v>

621
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.530
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like shooting like a shotgun.</v>

622
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

627
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

628
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.260
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys are,</v>

629
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.050
<v Speaker 4>you caught your Dick and then you just tell everybody it's awesome.</v>

630
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.940
<v Speaker 4>You don't want admit you're an idiot.</v>

631
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Is this like when they told me like we're going to have a punch yourself in the</v>

632
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.390
<v Speaker 4>face contest and I had to start for</v>

633
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.320
<v Speaker 4>exactly preposterous.</v>

634
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.910
<v Speaker 4>You guys are are in a way,</v>

635
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:29.911
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is you are turning yourself into a lab rat with the intention</v>

636
00:19:30.371 --> 00:19:33.880
<v Speaker 4>of gaining a kind of low level superpower,</v>

637
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.130
<v Speaker 4>like a really,</v>

638
00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:38.740
<v Speaker 4>really low on the scale of super powers,</v>

639
00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:42.220
<v Speaker 4>the ability to feel EMF fields.</v>

640
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they're called?</v>

641
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

642
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 4>he did feel that that's a really low power,</v>

643
00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:46.714
<v Speaker 4>but it's still,</v>

644
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.940
<v Speaker 4>you have more super powers than me.</v>

645
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't feel that you're still ahead of the majority of your species,</v>

646
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.370
<v Speaker 4>but there's a risk to this.</v>

647
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:59.371
<v Speaker 4>You're risking your life so that you can feel what it's like to be a</v>

648
00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:01.060
<v Speaker 4>refrigerator magnet.</v>

649
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Anything that you put in your body,</v>

650
00:20:02.831 --> 00:20:04.630
<v Speaker 4>you risk getting sepsis from.</v>

651
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.400
<v Speaker 4>There's a risk of sepsis.</v>

652
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:07.480
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

653
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.350
<v Speaker 4>there is a risk.</v>

654
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.820
<v Speaker 4>What exactly the Sepsis,</v>

655
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.560
<v Speaker 4>the sounds except Dick,</v>

656
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.031
<v Speaker 4>what does it mean?</v>

657
00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:17.800
<v Speaker 4>It means some sort of infection and the way bacterial infections of any sort.</v>

658
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.640
<v Speaker 4>So I've had a buddy who's a surgeon who told me,</v>

659
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.211
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

660
00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:22.901
<v Speaker 4>don't do this.</v>

661
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 4>This is a bad idea.</v>

662
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.151
<v Speaker 4>Good for you.</v>

663
00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 4>You got that done.</v>

664
00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:30.991
<v Speaker 4>But don't put anything else in your body because any implant can go septic can</v>

665
00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:31.951
<v Speaker 4>go bad.</v>

666
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:32.784
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

667
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I got my nose pierced and Venice beach when I was 15.</v>

668
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:37.360
<v Speaker 4>And you should have seen that man,</v>

669
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:38.020
<v Speaker 4>you swell up.</v>

670
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

671
00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:39.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

672
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 4>was just so nasty,</v>

673
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:41.951
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

674
00:20:41.951 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 4>My it,</v>

675
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.990
<v Speaker 4>my nose got swollen.</v>

676
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.980
<v Speaker 4>I pushed,</v>

677
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 4>I remember pushing against it in front of the mirror.</v>

678
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Just like the</v>

679
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 2>amount of pus,</v>

680
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>like where you get proud of the amount of pus coming out,</v>

681
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 2>that can kill people,</v>

683
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 2>staff like that.</v>

684
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And then ones of eating your whole nose off.</v>

685
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.331
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>

686
00:20:58.331 --> 00:20:59.021
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>

687
00:20:59.021 --> 00:20:59.291
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

688
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you should never get your nose pierce.</v>

689
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a ridiculous thing.</v>

690
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

691
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and there's no super power in that and you just look like a dumb ass what he</v>

692
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.044
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

693
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:08.651
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

694
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:09.484
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

695
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

696
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>so this is a changeable extra cents though,</v>

697
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 2>this disability to detect a magnetic field.</v>

698
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you really tend to do something that Dunkin or I can't with your body because of</v>

700
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:21.830
<v Speaker 2>these additions.</v>

701
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.340
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

702

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

703
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.320
<v Speaker 5>it's profound.</v>

704
00:21:24.321 --> 00:21:27.020
<v Speaker 5>It's something I didn't understand when I got it done.</v>

705
00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

730
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.600
<v Speaker 5>I've been around really strong magnets and when the first,</v>

731
00:22:14.601 --> 00:22:15.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

732
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.970
<v Speaker 5>was around a really strong magnet,</v>

733
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I felt a feeling in the pit of my stomach,</v>

734
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.260
<v Speaker 5>like dread and,</v>

735
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.830
<v Speaker 5>and it made me want to pull away and run away from it as your word.</v>

736
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.660
<v Speaker 5>Clinked no,</v>

737
00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a logical thing.</v>

738
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.143
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't,</v>

739
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.230
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a logic.</v>

740
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.640
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

741
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 5>the funny thing about that is I'm working out what our sensitivities are.</v>

742
00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:41.550
<v Speaker 5>There's been a lot of debate among the people who've had these things on how,</v>

743
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.790
<v Speaker 5>how close we can get to an MRI.</v>

744
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.690
<v Speaker 5>There are some people who talk about it being dangerous because it can,</v>

745
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.400
<v Speaker 5>you can move around.</v>

746
00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:51.110
<v Speaker 5>Since this is subdermal,</v>

747
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 5>it's not anchored in any way like a other subdermal a body mods are,</v>

748
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

749
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.190
<v Speaker 5>it could move your magnet a bit,</v>

750
00:23:01.191 --> 00:23:02.180
<v Speaker 5>one way or another,</v>

751
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.440
<v Speaker 5>someone's got to test it.</v>

752
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.521
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

753
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:04.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

754
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.830
<v Speaker 5>there are people who've claimed,</v>

755
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:07.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

756
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:08.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

757
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.930
<v Speaker 5>through the network of people who install these.</v>

758
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 5>There are people who have claimed that they've had a Mris done and felt their</v>

759
00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:17.450
<v Speaker 5>magnet dance around and that's it.</v>

760
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

761
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.280
<v Speaker 2>But the Mris,</v>

762
00:23:19.281 --> 00:23:21.980
<v Speaker 2>a super powerful magnet that you're talking about,</v>

763
00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:22.490
<v Speaker 2>that tiny</v>

764
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.990
<v Speaker 5>ones are like 1.5,</v>

765
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 5>1.5 Teslas.</v>

766
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.270
<v Speaker 5>But people go into those things with sweater.</v>

767
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:31.160
<v Speaker 5>Is sweatshirts with the zippers on them?</v>

768
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

769
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

770
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I talked to a guy who operates when in research facility and you,</v>

771
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.380
<v Speaker 5>that's why I'm like,</v>

772
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 5>funny you should mention this because,</v>

773
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 5>but that's not standard operational procedures.</v>

774
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.100
<v Speaker 5>1.5 post it.</v>

775
00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:45.300
<v Speaker 5>You supposed to get down to robe.</v>

776
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 5>I just had one a couple of days ago.</v>

777
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 1>He take your clothes off that you don't,</v>

778
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:50.281
<v Speaker 1>you don't go.</v>

779
00:23:50.281 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 1>You sure they weren't just fucking with you?</v>

780
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you don't know anything about MRI magnets and stolen your hand?</v>

781
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy man.</v>

782
00:23:58.281 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't go in there with zippers on what kind of a fucking doctor these people</v>

783
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

784
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a research facility.</v>

785
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:03.704
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

786
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

787
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.780
<v Speaker 1>can I get what you said?</v>

788
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Someone's died from an MRI.</v>

789
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:08.294
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

790
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

791
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to say is if you have metal in the room when they turn the MRI on a</v>

792
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>child died recently accidentally because they had an oxygen tank and the room</v>

793
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't aware they had it in there.</v>

794
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So when you turn on the MRI,</v>

795
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the fucking oxygen tank comes flying into the machine.</v>

796
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.943
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

797
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.491
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>

798
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 1>super powerful magnet and it killed them by the time they could shut it off,</v>

799
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 1>he was already dead.</v>

800
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's insane amount of pressure you're dealing with and it's just cause</v>

801
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 1>someone's dumb enough to have metal in the room.</v>

802
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So I really find it hard to believe that any doctor would allow someone to go</v>

803
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>through an Mri with a zipper on.</v>

804
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>That's preposterous.</v>

805
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just not what they do.</v>

806
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So I question who you're talking to.</v>

807
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Him talking to crazy people lying about putting magnets in their dicks and</v>

808
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:49.350
<v Speaker 1>wearing zippers into Mri.</v>

809
00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:50.184
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta hang it.</v>

810
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You've got to hang out with a higher quality.</v>

811
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.803
<v Speaker 1>Grew up with humans,</v>

812
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 1>a higher quality room.</v>

813
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.690
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

814
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.440
<v Speaker 6>but there is,</v>

815
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.640
<v Speaker 6>there is a magnetic shielding cause you know people that have pacemakers or</v>

816
00:24:59.641 --> 00:25:00.474
<v Speaker 6>other implants.</v>

817
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh they put like something over you to stop that.</v>

818
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>No suit or something like that.</v>

819
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

821
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.051
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

822
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 1>But you're not doing that with your fingers.</v>

823
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:11.140
<v Speaker 1>You just let him tingle if you get in there allegedly don't know and somebody</v>

824
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 1>really should be careful about.</v>

825
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.020
<v Speaker 6>But I think,</v>

826
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:13.810
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

827
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.230
<v Speaker 6>I think it's something that should be tested.</v>

828
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.240
<v Speaker 6>I think if we've even,</v>

829
00:25:18.241 --> 00:25:19.074
<v Speaker 6>even if you're not,</v>

830
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm not advocating that someone with this in their finger go in and test it,</v>

831
00:25:23.101 --> 00:25:24.000
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

832
00:25:24.001 --> 00:25:28.110
<v Speaker 6>even if you can replicate the consistency of human and put,</v>

833
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:28.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

834
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.700
<v Speaker 6>like a human flesh,</v>

835
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:29.970
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

836
00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 6>demand it in and then expose it to something like 1.5 Tesla just to see what</v>

837
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:36.294
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

838
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Now you have this which you've already done with the magnets.</v>

839
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.201
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

840
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>what's the next level thing?</v>

841
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Obviously everything progresses.</v>

842
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.681
<v Speaker 1>So what did,</v>

843
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 1>what are people considering doing now?</v>

844
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.270
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

845
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:48.900
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

846
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.220
<v Speaker 6>we're doing well,</v>

847
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.790
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people are building devices that interact with a magnet.</v>

848
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.040
<v Speaker 6>So you can think of it as a,</v>

849
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.190
<v Speaker 6>because it interacts with electricity and magnetism.</v>

850
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.590
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like a really low level input.</v>

851
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.820
<v Speaker 6>You can input anything.</v>

852
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

853
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.600
<v Speaker 6>so if you've got an external device that's measuring,</v>

854
00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:09.810
<v Speaker 6>say the amount of co two in the room,</v>

855
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.050
<v Speaker 6>you could hook that up through a coil around your finger,</v>

856
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:13.501
<v Speaker 6>around your,</v>

857
00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:18.501
<v Speaker 6>your magnet finger and have that information transferred into like pulses or how</v>

858
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:21.540
<v Speaker 6>much it vibrates or whatever.</v>

859
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 6>So you're literally using an external sensor to to give you data,</v>

860
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.893
<v Speaker 6>any data,</v>

861
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.070
<v Speaker 6>any data you want and have it transfer that to the magnet.</v>

862
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.450
<v Speaker 6>And after,</v>

863
00:26:33.451 --> 00:26:35.640
<v Speaker 6>after some training it becomes intuitive.</v>

864
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.931
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

865
00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:37.764
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

866
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.191
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

867
00:26:38.191 --> 00:26:41.400
<v Speaker 6>some people have done it with mainly sonar and thermal,</v>

868
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.030
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

869
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 6>like a thermal laser.</v>

870
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that people have talked about the ultimate,</v>

871
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.180
<v Speaker 2>the all the,</v>

872
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate future of incorporating technology and the human body as the</v>

873
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 2>ability to take the mind and download it's consciousness somewhere into a,</v>

874
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>an artificial creation.</v>

875
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 2>But somewhere along the line is probably going to be some steps.</v>

876
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:04.974
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

877
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And you guys are kind of taking like one of the steps,</v>

878
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 2>like by putting magnets in your body.</v>

879
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 2>When do you think you're going to see someone who puts a cell phone in their</v>

880
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:15.360
<v Speaker 2>body?</v>

881
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.193
<v Speaker 2>Is that coming?</v>

882
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Is it going to be like a neural interface that allows you to get online with</v>

883
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:20.244
<v Speaker 2>Wifi?</v>

884
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

885
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.470
<v Speaker 5>we're somewhere towards that.</v>

886
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 5>That's something else we're working on.</v>

887
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:26.771
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

888
00:27:26.771 --> 00:27:27.604
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

889
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.170
<v Speaker 5>our CTO,</v>

890
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.221
<v Speaker 5>his dream,</v>

891
00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:33.850
<v Speaker 5>the thing that brought us all together wasn't magnets.</v>

892
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.570
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

893
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.650
<v Speaker 5>that was ancillary.</v>

894
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.760
<v Speaker 5>He was love,</v>

895
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.151
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

896
00:27:37.151 --> 00:27:37.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

897
00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:37.841
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

898
00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:42.310
<v Speaker 5>of course it was love because we all kind of knew each other and we all had this</v>

899
00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:47.140
<v Speaker 5>love of the future and we all kind of were told to sit back and let Motorola</v>

900
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.243
<v Speaker 5>take care of it.</v>

901
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.280
<v Speaker 5>And none of us wanted to deal with that.</v>

902
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

903
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 5>but he wanted to build something that he believed that we have the ability to do</v>

904
00:27:58.181 --> 00:27:59.320
<v Speaker 5>this stuff ourselves.</v>

905
00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:01.630
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to wait for some big company to do it.</v>

906
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.070
<v Speaker 5>We can do it cheap.</v>

907
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 5>We can do it ourselves,</v>

908
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:05.110
<v Speaker 5>design ourselves.</v>

909
00:28:05.111 --> 00:28:09.040
<v Speaker 5>And since we know people who can install magnets under our skin,</v>

910
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.810
<v Speaker 5>why not and implant?</v>

911
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.793
<v Speaker 5>Why not something?</v>

912
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

913
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.710
<v Speaker 5>the goal was to have something.</v>

914
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 5>So basically what it does is a,</v>

915
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:17.950
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

916
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.783
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

917
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:19.990
<v Speaker 5>it's a rose compass,</v>

918
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:20.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

919
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.450
<v Speaker 5>that electrically stimulates you.</v>

920
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

921
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.070
<v Speaker 5>it's probably here on your cath and it's always pointing north so that you</v>

922
00:28:27.071 --> 00:28:29.740
<v Speaker 5>always have an intuitive sense of where north is.</v>

923
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Now if you've got,</v>

924
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.570
<v Speaker 5>if you've got the chip talking to some external thing,</v>

925
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.780
<v Speaker 5>you could hook it up to a map system like Google maps and be like,</v>

926
00:28:37.781 --> 00:28:38.230
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

927
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.063
<v Speaker 5>take me home.</v>

928
00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.940
<v Speaker 5>And then you have an intuitive sense of where home is always,</v>

929
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.823
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

930
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.890
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

931
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.073
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

932
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

933
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Wait back that up.</v>

934
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.320
<v Speaker 2>You have a compass and stalled in your body and the body,</v>

935
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Speaker 2>how does it run?</v>

936
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.770
<v Speaker 2>It just runs on the magnetism that's in the compass.</v>

937
00:28:56.771 --> 00:28:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It's all mechanical.</v>

938
00:28:57.821 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Is that electronics involved?</v>

939
00:28:59.101 --> 00:28:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

940
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.730
<v Speaker 2>It can be powered wirelessly.</v>

941
00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:01.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

942
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.290
<v Speaker 2>it's got like a wireless coil in it and it's powered somehow by an external.</v>

943
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

944
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.031
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

945
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:06.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

946
00:29:06.131 --> 00:29:07.570
<v Speaker 2>And so you can like hover it over it.</v>

947
00:29:07.571 --> 00:29:07.780
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

948
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.640
<v Speaker 2>that's what the dream is.</v>

949
00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And what is the method of communication to the mind that explains where newer</v>

950
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:15.970
<v Speaker 2>north is or how to get home.</v>

951
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

952
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.560
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that you're using a really simple system in terms of the magnet,</v>

953
00:29:20.561 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 2>you're not using any magic.</v>

954
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:23.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just vibrating for this.</v>

955
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just applying a very,</v>

956
00:29:24.761 --> 00:29:28.540
<v Speaker 2>very small amount of electricity enough that you can,</v>

957
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:28.930
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

958
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a sensation so it's not like blaring and it's not shocking you,</v>

959
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:34.540
<v Speaker 2>but there is a sensation.</v>

960
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Is this completely theoretical,</v>

961
00:29:35.981 --> 00:29:38.980
<v Speaker 2>the idea of being able to find your way home or is there any we,</v>

962
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.850
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

963
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.223
<v Speaker 2>parts of it,</v>

965
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>parts of it built.</v>

966
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 6>And actually when we came together and we had that idea,</v>

967
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.881
<v Speaker 6>we said,</v>

968
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:46.151
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

969
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 6>this thing has way too many features.</v>

970
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:50.480
<v Speaker 6>So what we're gonna do is we're going to build a,</v>

971
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.360
<v Speaker 6>we're going to build an implant that's kind of a halfway step to there so that</v>

972
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 6>we build the ground,</v>

973
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

974
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.621
<v Speaker 6>towards it.</v>

975
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 6>And that's actually,</v>

976
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.720
<v Speaker 6>it's actually this thing here.</v>

977
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 6>And so what this thing does is it actually,</v>

978
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 6>it's a quantified self,</v>

979
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 6>a health metric.</v>

980
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 6>And this is,</v>

981
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

982
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 6>this is just going to take data.</v>

983
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.323
<v Speaker 6>You can check this out.</v>

984
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:15.911
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

985
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

986
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 6>takes medical data and sends it to your phone.</v>

987
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.123
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

988
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 6>so if you can imagine having maybe six months worth of,</v>

989
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:25.301
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

990
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Speaker 6>of your medical data and it's your data,</v>

991
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:29.140
<v Speaker 6>it's not anyone else's data,</v>

992
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.093
<v Speaker 6>your data,</v>

993
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

994
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 6>and you can do whatever with it.</v>

995
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

996
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.070
<v Speaker 6>and so we wanted to kind of make,</v>

997
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.380
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

998
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 6>do a halfway project so that we get familiar with implant technology and then</v>

999
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 6>move towards really cool shit.</v>

1000
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.741
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1001
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:44.941
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1002
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I d I,</v>

1003
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1004
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1005
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a compass,</v>

1006
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you,</v>

1007
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you could power it somehow,</v>

1008
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't understand is how the compass is communicating with your mind.</v>

1009
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.210
<v Speaker 6>So in the,</v>

1010
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.630
<v Speaker 6>in the same way that,</v>

1011
00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1012
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.490
<v Speaker 6>the nervous system is,</v>

1013
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 6>is communicating with your mind.</v>

1014
00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

1015
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.893
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1016
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.740
<v Speaker 6>it's not sending it wirelessly to your brain right there.</v>

1017
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 6>There are things in your body that's communicating to your nervous system that</v>

1018
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 6>then goes to your mind,</v>

1019
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1020
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 6>And so you're literally,</v>

1021
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1022
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 6>you're literally making a new mini Oregon that,</v>

1023
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1024
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 6>or another part of your body that interfaces with your nervous system through</v>

1025
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:25.324
<v Speaker 6>electricity.</v>

1026
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.150
<v Speaker 6>And then</v>

1027
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you're just saying it's like a vibration or something.</v>

1028
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:30.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a low level pulse or something.</v>

1029
00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1030
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.273
<v Speaker 1>It's a low level.</v>

1031
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

1032
00:31:32.841 --> 00:31:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you would get a sensation,</v>

1033
00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:37.010
<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand how it could be directional.</v>

1034
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the mechanism.</v>

1035
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1036
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:38.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1037
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.381
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1038
00:31:39.381 --> 00:31:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a rose compass,</v>

1039
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:40.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1040
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So what does a rose compass mean?</v>

1041
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.343
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1042
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.700
<v Speaker 6>so it's got a clock.</v>

1043
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.151
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:46.260
<v Speaker 6>It's got a north,</v>

1045
00:31:46.261 --> 00:31:46.741
<v Speaker 6>south,</v>

1046
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:47.011
<v Speaker 6>east,</v>

1047
00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:47.431
<v Speaker 6>west,</v>

1048
00:31:47.431 --> 00:31:48.780
<v Speaker 6>and then northwest.</v>

1049
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.171
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1050
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:50.360
<v Speaker 6>that's called the rose compass.</v>

1051
00:31:50.361 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.240
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1053
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.380
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1054
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.081
<v Speaker 6>so it's a compass.</v>

1055
00:31:52.081 --> 00:31:52.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.001
<v Speaker 6>And yeah,</v>

1057
00:31:53.001 --> 00:31:53.131
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1058
00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:53.341
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1059
00:31:53.341 --> 00:31:54.174
<v Speaker 6>it's a compass.</v>

1060
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.193
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

1061
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.500
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1062
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.333
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

1063
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.750
<v Speaker 6>let's say I'm facing north,</v>

1064
00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.120
<v Speaker 6>the stimulation will be going this way,</v>

1065
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.163
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1066
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 6>But if I,</v>

1067
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.840
<v Speaker 6>if I turn,</v>

1068
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:04.763
<v Speaker 6>it's gonna Start.</v>

1069
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.380
<v Speaker 6>So start,</v>

1070
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:06.860
<v Speaker 6>stimulate.</v>

1071
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It's directional.</v>

1072
00:32:08.151 --> 00:32:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It's direct that wherever the north is,</v>

1073
00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:12.680
<v Speaker 1>it gives a signal or warning where the Arrow goes.</v>

1074
00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.600
<v Speaker 1>So narrow and not just,</v>

1076
00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.160
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just act as a beacon.</v>

1077
00:32:16.161 --> 00:32:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It's somehow or another like sends a charge off in that direction and then it</v>

1078
00:32:20.511 --> 00:32:21.920
<v Speaker 1>becomes intuitive.</v>

1079
00:32:21.921 --> 00:32:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Once you start determining what that signal means,</v>

1080
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.560
<v Speaker 1>like it becomes a new thing,</v>

1081
00:32:27.561 --> 00:32:30.110
<v Speaker 1>sorta like sound like you hear sound over here and you know,</v>

1082
00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it's coming in that direction.</v>

1083
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:32.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's crazy intuitive</v>

1084
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.410
<v Speaker 6>in the sense that like I would be working with a,</v>

1085
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 6>with some of the guys in the lab and you know they've got two or three implants</v>

1086
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 6>and they would say leave the soldering iron on and they'd go to reach to grab</v>

1087
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:47.440
<v Speaker 6>something and just them feeling this,</v>

1088
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.000
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1089
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 6>the intensity of the soldering iron would make them pull back.</v>

1090
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1091
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 6>And so it's not like they're like,</v>

1092
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 6>oh shit that,</v>

1093
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 6>that might kill me.</v>

1094
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:55.881
<v Speaker 6>Let me pull back.</v>

1095
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:56.714
<v Speaker 6>It's more like,</v>

1096
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 6>it's more like every time you reach over here something screams at you or,</v>

1097
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 6>or something like pokes you,</v>

1098
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like people who are allergic to cats,</v>

1099
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.510
<v Speaker 4>if you're around the you,</v>

1100
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.590
<v Speaker 4>that's a kind of superpower a person is allergic to.</v>

1101
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Cats can walk into a house and be like,</v>

1102
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.161
<v Speaker 4>you have cats,</v>

1103
00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:15.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1104
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 4>You have cats.</v>

1105
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.080
<v Speaker 4>They can sense the cat cause they start sneezing and coughing.</v>

1106
00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 4>You're dirty and you know,</v>

1107
00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:21.304
<v Speaker 4>clean your house.</v>

1108
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:21.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Well generally people have cats,</v>

1110
00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:23.934
<v Speaker 4>cats,</v>

1111
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.450
<v Speaker 4>gross,</v>

1112

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.781
<v Speaker 4>He felt it.</v>

1114
00:33:25.781 --> 00:33:29.530
<v Speaker 4>When you walk into a house and you get that first waft of the cat litter box and</v>

1115
00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:31.300

<v Speaker 4>and I picture you in a basement in,</v>

1127
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.150
<v Speaker 4>in basements with straight razors,</v>

1128
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.260
<v Speaker 4>shaking,</v>

1129

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 4>guys are both right.</v>

1137
00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:19.840
<v Speaker 4>You're both kind of rights.</v>

1138
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.670
<v Speaker 4>They don't all go to a dog.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1144
00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:31.930
<v Speaker 4>and I imagine that when before you guys put the magnets and you're snorting</v>

1145
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.040
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin or like you're definitely on painkillers,</v>

1146
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.903
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1147
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.590
<v Speaker 6>I got it done with no pain meds and uh,</v>

1148
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.830
<v Speaker 6>oh my gosh.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1150
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:43.680
<v Speaker 6>it was a rush.</v>

1151
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.760
<v Speaker 6>I never had that much.</v>

1152
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 4>That's a new man do to stay down there with a razor blade in the photo says,</v>

1153
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell him without painkillers and oh my gosh,</v>

1154
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.233
<v Speaker 4>what a rush.</v>

1155
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:53.881
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

1156
00:34:53.881 --> 00:34:54.714
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

1157
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.560
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

1158
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.311
<v Speaker 6>it was something else.</v>

1159
00:34:56.311 --> 00:34:57.360
<v Speaker 6>He mounted with endorphins.</v>

1160
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:57.751
<v Speaker 6>He got,</v>

1161
00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:58.370
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's trauma.</v>

1164
00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:04.140
<v Speaker 6>Your body is going through trauma and your body releases all that endorphins all</v>

1165
00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:04.974
<v Speaker 6>at once.</v>

1171
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't advocate people doing this to advocate in the opening themselves up at</v>

00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 5>She uses vodka and hot glue to coat the magnets.</v>

1207
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:09.803
<v Speaker 5>She uh,</v>

1208
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 5>in her speech she told everyone,</v>

1209
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1210
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't care how hardcore you think you are.</v>

1211
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Get a spotter.</v>

1212
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 5>And as you will pass out.</v>

1214
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>

1215
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 5>that to me,</v>

1216
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:19.861
<v Speaker 5>that to me,</v>

1217
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 5>she also used a vegetable peeler</v>

1218
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.233
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

1219
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.040
<v Speaker 4>That to me is not,</v>

1220
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.290
<v Speaker 4>is not DIY cybernetics.</v>

1221
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:28.490
<v Speaker 4>That's irresponsible.</v>

1222
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.723
<v Speaker 4>It's Bailey.</v>

1223
00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you that when you told me her name,</v>

1224
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 4>you don't leave at home with your keys.</v>

1225
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:39.110
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that speeds weapon and I emailed her directly after this speech</v>

1226
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:41.210
<v Speaker 4>because I wanted to get her on my podcast,</v>

1227
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:41.841
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

1228
00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:42.201
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1229
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:44.060
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know she was a she cause she's Androgynous,</v>

1230
00:36:44.061 --> 00:36:44.960
<v Speaker 4>you can't really tell,</v>

1231
00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.650
<v Speaker 4>but she looks like she fell out of a Philip k Dick novel.</v>

1232
00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Like she is a really fascinating being.</v>

1233
00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:56.000
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a really curious being and she seems kind of nonchalant about what</v>

1234
00:36:56.001 --> 00:36:59.510
<v Speaker 4>she's doing and it reminds me of you guys a little bit because you guys seem to</v>

1235
00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:04.280
<v Speaker 4>be brushing off the fact that what you're doing can make it so that in 20 years</v>

1236
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.770
<v Speaker 4>you are just basically a trembling drink machines.</v>

1237
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:12.590
<v Speaker 4>Somebody could put a cocktail in your hand and makes it up because you have some</v>

1238
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:16.370
<v Speaker 4>kind of severe neurological damage from the weird chemicals in your magnets</v>

1239
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.630
<v Speaker 4>going into your brain.</v>

1240
00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:18.801
<v Speaker 5>It could be true.</v>

1241
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:19.400
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

1242
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.000
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

1243
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.833
<v Speaker 5>Totally right.</v>

1244
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.960
<v Speaker 5>We probably would be dealing with something worse than a Parkinson's like state.</v>

1245
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 5>We cannot get up on the mic.</v>

1246
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:28.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

1247
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:29.290
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>

1248
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:29.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1249
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.890
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1250
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.343
<v Speaker 5>There are risks.</v>

1251
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.193
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1252

<v Speaker 5>when left gave that speech,</v>

1253
00:37:35.121 --> 00:37:39.140
<v Speaker 5>he gave it with the intent that people out there would see her process and go,</v>

1254
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:40.041
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1255
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:41.270
<v Speaker 5>you could do it so much better.</v>

1256
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.650
<v Speaker 5>You could do it so much safer.</v>

1257
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:47.360
<v Speaker 5>And when people are talking about what grindings about and why it's called</v>

<v Speaker 5>grinding,</v>

1259
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.060
<v Speaker 5>that's part of part of the spirit of being a grinder is being open about your</v>

1260
00:37:53.061 --> 00:37:57.020
<v Speaker 5>processes because you're hoping that someone will look at your processes and go,</v>

1261
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:57.891
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome term.</v>

1306
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we were when we're out there looking for bigfoot.</v>

1307
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 1>We were two dorks here,</v>

1308
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.901
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1309
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:13.380
<v Speaker 1>having a time of our lives with fuck doors.</v>

1310
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.300
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with being a door.</v>

1311
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no disrespect intended,</v>

1312
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:17.614
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect.</v>

1313
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1314
00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1315
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not taking yourself that seriously.</v>

1317
00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:21.900
<v Speaker 1>You never in your whole group after college.</v>

1318
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:23.501
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1320
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 6>part of,</v>

1321
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:24.131
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1322
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 6>part of what we do is,</v>

1323
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:26.344
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1324
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.300
<v Speaker 6>is using,</v>

1325
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 6>we're still using the scientific method.</v>

1326
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 6>We're not just like,</v>

1327
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.833
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

1328
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.913
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1329
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 6>what we're doing is we're putting our method out there for it to be criticized</v>

1330
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:38.900
<v Speaker 6>so that it's safe in,</v>

1331
00:39:38.901 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 6>in our community.</v>

1332
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1333
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 6>And we're,</v>

1334
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>

1335
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1336
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:42.791
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1337
00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 6>cut yourself open with vegetable peelers and it's not,</v>

1338
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 6>it's not have,</v>

1339
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.501
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>

1340
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 6>have the method be held up by the FDA for 50 years.</v>

1341
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.400
<v Speaker 6>It's about knowing what the risks are as an individual and deciding whether to</v>

1342
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:58.840
<v Speaker 6>take it or not.</v>

1343
00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.673
<v Speaker 6>That's that piece of it.</v>

1344
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.511
<v Speaker 1>Plastics,</v>

1345
00:40:00.511 --> 00:40:01.151
<v Speaker 1>silicon,</v>

1346
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:01.811
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1347
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:01.981
<v Speaker 1>What it,</v>

1348
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 1>what does that exactly mean?</v>

1349
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you showed me earlier the chip.</v>

1350
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1351
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.690
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1352
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.460
<v Speaker 5>that's regular circuit board.</v>

1353
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of bad shit and therefore women wasn't made out of fiberglass,</v>

1354
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.610
<v Speaker 5>copper or metal plastics.</v>

1355
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.470
<v Speaker 5>Where would you put that?</v>

1356
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.060
<v Speaker 5>Inside a a silicone silicone shape.</v>

1357
00:40:20.061 --> 00:40:21.350
<v Speaker 5>There was a bio proofing process,</v>

1358
00:40:21.351 --> 00:40:22.184
<v Speaker 5>like a sheath,</v>

1359
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:22.860
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1360
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.580
<v Speaker 5>like a condom,</v>

1361
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.130
<v Speaker 5>silicone condom sort of thing.</v>

1362
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.971
<v Speaker 5>More like a,</v>

1363
00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:26.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1364
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.380
<v Speaker 5>something more secure.</v>

1365
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.120
<v Speaker 5>You take a CNC,</v>

1366
00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.740
<v Speaker 5>you make a CNC mold,</v>

1367
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1368
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.031
<v Speaker 5>reverse.</v>

1369
00:40:32.031 --> 00:40:36.470
<v Speaker 5>So this isn't an unpopulated board because all of our regular prototypes are</v>

1370
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:37.370
<v Speaker 5>being tested.</v>

1371
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1372
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 5>who on on four function functionability functionality,</v>

1373
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.031
<v Speaker 5>functionality,</v>

1374
00:40:44.031 --> 00:40:44.450
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1375
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.811
<v Speaker 5>Keating,</v>

1376
00:40:44.811 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 5>it crushing it.</v>

1377
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:51.950
<v Speaker 5>So once we're confident that we have like something that can handle the stresses</v>

1378
00:40:52.191 --> 00:40:53.120
<v Speaker 5>that we think,</v>

1379
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:53.931
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1380
00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:57.200
<v Speaker 5>someone who would have something in it for a year,</v>

1381
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 5>which is our goal.</v>

1382
00:40:58.431 --> 00:41:00.890
<v Speaker 5>Like get it inside someone for a year and take it out.</v>

1383
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.500
<v Speaker 5>Then we're testing bio proofing.</v>

1384
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Bio proofing is doing a pressure injected silicone mold.</v>

1385
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1386
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That's just sounds like it would hurt.</v>

1387
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have in your car that's not inside you?</v>

1388
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:14.644
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

1389
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 1>want to know though is like what part of the body would you install this thing?</v>

1390
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:21.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1391
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.810
<v Speaker 5>Tim's been talking about the forearm.</v>

1392
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.773
<v Speaker 5>Why the forum?</v>

1393
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.820
<v Speaker 5>Because it would be cool to look down at your arm and see LED's lighten up</v>

1394
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 5>underneath your skin.</v>

1395
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:31.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.191
<v Speaker 5>So that's part of it.</v>

1397
00:41:32.191 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 5>You guys aren't just pioneers trying</v>

1398
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 4>to read a fine humanity.</v>

1399
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:39.060
<v Speaker 4>You just want to have shining lights under your scan.</v>

1400
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Some dork pussy.</v>

1401
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Let's be honest.</v>

1402
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.250
<v Speaker 4>We are Jeff,</v>

1403
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 4>many different types of</v>

1404
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.871
<v Speaker 4>dead man.</v>

1405
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:48.131
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

1406
00:41:48.131 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 4>you're a super baller in the grinder community.</v>

1407
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 4>If you walk around with a glowing implant on your arm.</v>

1408
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys have a,</v>

1410
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 4>in your community,</v>

1411
00:41:55.461 --> 00:41:56.990
<v Speaker 4>somebody who you know,</v>

1412
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 4>will put anything under their skin,</v>

1413
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 4>like somebody who walks around Jangling with metal pieces and lights.</v>

1414
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.741
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>

1415
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 4>is there a person who's got the most implants?</v>

1416
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.170
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1417
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.003
<v Speaker 6>no I don't.</v>

1418
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.840
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we've reached there yet.</v>

1419
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.560
<v Speaker 4>What's the most incredible,</v>

1420
00:42:11.561 --> 00:42:14.230
<v Speaker 4>like the most extreme implant that you're aware of?</v>

1421
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.483
<v Speaker 6>Maybe rich.</v>

1422
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1423
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 6>Probably fucking rich.</v>

1424
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.030
<v Speaker 6>Rich is going on with rich.</v>

1425
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.051
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1426
00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1427
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.213
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>

1428
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1429
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>

1430
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.433
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1431
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 6>two magnet implants in his finger and he actually has,</v>

1432
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:28.663
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1433
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 6>he has a coil,</v>

1434
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 6>like a huge coil that he uses to,</v>

1435
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:33.704
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1436
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 6>to be able to like hear radio stations and all sorts of craziness.</v>

1437
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 6>They're basically implanted earphones.</v>

1438
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.301
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>

1439
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 4>When he has,</v>

1440
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 4>he has magnets on his fingers.</v>

1441
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Ears in his ears.</v>

1442
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.411
<v Speaker 4>Ears.</v>

1443
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1444
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.081
<v Speaker 4>Magnets.</v>

1445
00:42:46.081 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1446
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1447
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 4>So he's got his fingers in his ears.</v>

1448
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Xochi said.</v>

1449
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:49.571
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:50.340
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>

1451
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.160
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1452
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.480
<v Speaker 6>he's got like two minutes.</v>

1453
00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:53.314
<v Speaker 6>Ears,</v>

1454
00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:53.681
<v Speaker 6>ears.</v>

1455
00:42:53.681 --> 00:42:53.981
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

1456
00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:54.850
<v Speaker 6>That's scary.</v>

1457
00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.043
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1458
00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:56.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1459
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.590
<v Speaker 4>They'll use easy to operate on your ears.</v>

1460
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.433
<v Speaker 4>He's intense.</v>

1461
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.533
<v Speaker 4>He's intense.</v>

1462
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.860
<v Speaker 4>And so what's the coil?</v>

1463
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.970
<v Speaker 5>The coil is a,</v>

1464
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:04.870
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1465
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:05.703
<v Speaker 5>any coil.</v>

1466
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.650
<v Speaker 5>It's stimulating these magnets makes of magnet vibrate.</v>

1467
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.500
<v Speaker 5>So he hooked up this coil to a,</v>

1468
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:15.400
<v Speaker 5>a little amplifier and that amplifier sending sound through it,</v>

1469
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:16.420
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1470
00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.500
<v Speaker 5>your standard speaker,</v>

1471
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1472
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.490
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1473
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.340
<v Speaker 5>You send sound through a speaker coil,</v>

1474
00:43:20.341 --> 00:43:25.030
<v Speaker 5>it make some magnet jump back or makes a magnet a forced the coil back and forth</v>

1475
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:25.933
<v Speaker 5>and you make sound.</v>

1476
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.820
<v Speaker 5>So he's using this,</v>

1477
00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:28.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1478
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.460
<v Speaker 5>sending electromagnetic waves to,</v>

1479
00:43:30.461 --> 00:43:31.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1480
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.290
<v Speaker 5>the magnets in his ears,</v>

1481
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.180
<v Speaker 5>his magnet stance around,</v>

1482
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.560
<v Speaker 5>and they give them sound.</v>

1483
00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:36.700
<v Speaker 5>So he was able to,</v>

1484
00:43:36.701 --> 00:43:37.534
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1485
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.750
<v Speaker 5>use a Bluetooth connection to his phone to hear his phone through as invisible,</v>

1486
00:43:44.681 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1487
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.123
<v Speaker 4>your phones.</v>

1488
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1489
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:47.841
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1490
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:48.674
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1491
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1492
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1493
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.560
<v Speaker 6>it sounds really crazy and dangerous,</v>

1494
00:43:51.561 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 6>but I think,</v>

1495
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.851
<v Speaker 6>I think there's,</v>

1496
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 6>we're also trying to establish a precedent that we want.</v>

1497
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.610
<v Speaker 6>Like we,</v>

1498
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 6>no matter what organization pops up,</v>

1499
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be cyborgs in the future.</v>

1500
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.393
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

1501
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.343
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1502
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.860
<v Speaker 6>I think that that's what we're listing.</v>

1503
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're moving towards.</v>

1504
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.130
<v Speaker 6>And I think that we want to move to a future where people are openly</v>

1505
00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 6>experimenting with themselves instead of having to go to one source.</v>

1506
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1507
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1508
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.740
<v Speaker 6>like company x to get their implants.</v>

1509
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 6>And I think there's,</v>

1510
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:28.270
<v Speaker 6>there's a sort of liberation that you have by either making your own implant or</v>

1511
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.274
<v Speaker 6>knowing,</v>

1512
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 6>knowing what</v>

1513
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 5>it was made of,</v>

1514
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 5>who coded it,</v>

1515
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 5>what the code is and,</v>

1516
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 5>and all sorts of stuff.</v>

1517
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 5>So in our community,</v>

1518
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.050
<v Speaker 5>we share all of the information there is,</v>

1519
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.960
<v Speaker 5>there is no weird outside control because everyone knows how it was built and if</v>

1520
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 5>you don't like how it was built,</v>

1521
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 5>you can change it.</v>

1522
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.101
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg,</v>

1523
00:44:49.101 --> 00:44:50.090
<v Speaker 1>if you wear glasses,</v>

1524
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.290
<v Speaker 1>is the Nordi incorporation of technology into the human body.</v>

1525
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I try to avoid like the word Cyborg because the moment that people start saying</v>

1526
00:44:58.771 --> 00:44:59.604
<v Speaker 4>Cyborg,</v>

1527
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.481
<v Speaker 4>everyone's like,</v>

1528
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:01.410
<v Speaker 4>you're not a Cyborg.</v>

1529
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:01.810
<v Speaker 4>Cyborg.</v>

1530
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:02.251
<v Speaker 4>Start this.</v>

1531
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 4>And that means,</v>

1532
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1533
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.380
<v Speaker 1>some someone made with a machine,</v>

1534
00:45:05.381 --> 00:45:07.510
<v Speaker 1>these things you have sitting on your face and that's how,</v>

1535
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.560
<v Speaker 1>that's how you see better.</v>

1536
00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And without those you wouldn't see so,</v>

1537
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1538
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1539
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.320
<v Speaker 4>I think I thought a Cyborg,</v>

1540
00:45:12.321 --> 00:45:13.970
<v Speaker 4>it means that it's part of you now.</v>

1541
00:45:13.971 --> 00:45:17.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't take it off like it's permanently in you.</v>

1542
00:45:17.421 --> 00:45:17.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1543
00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:20.240
<v Speaker 4>You've learned hearing implants.</v>

1544
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:21.350
<v Speaker 4>Those are first steps.</v>

1545
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1546
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:22.210
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1547
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:22.430
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1548
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Hearing aids,</v>

1549
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 4>but you know what else is crazy and dangerous learning to build an airplane.</v>

1550
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Like think of the Wright brothers way back when,</v>

1551
00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:34.280
<v Speaker 4>when they were telling people we're going to try to make a device that makes us</v>

1552
00:45:34.281 --> 00:45:35.510
<v Speaker 4>fly like birds,</v>

1553
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.291
<v Speaker 4>frightened,</v>

1554
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:36.881
<v Speaker 4>terrified.</v>

1555
00:45:36.881 --> 00:45:38.330
<v Speaker 4>People like are you out of your mind?</v>

1556
00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:39.111
<v Speaker 4>You're going to fall,</v>

1557
00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:40.550
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to fall to your death.</v>

1558
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.451
<v Speaker 4>And it's true.</v>

1559
00:45:41.451 --> 00:45:45.500
<v Speaker 4>There is an implicit risk whenever you're trying to create some new invention.</v>

1560
00:45:45.501 --> 00:45:47.690
<v Speaker 4>And if you wait for the FDA,</v>

1561
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:52.870
<v Speaker 4>if we sit around and wait for apple or for Microsoft to get this stuff passed,</v>

1562
00:45:53.391 --> 00:45:54.800
<v Speaker 4>it is going to be 50 years,</v>

1563
00:45:54.801 --> 00:45:58.130
<v Speaker 4>a hundred years because we need you guys to turn it.</v>

1564
00:45:58.131 --> 00:46:01.010
<v Speaker 4>A few of you are going to have to turn into the toxic avenger.</v>

1565
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.630
<v Speaker 4>A few of you are.</v>

1566
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.261
<v Speaker 4>It's true,</v>

1567
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:03.531
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1568
00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:04.011
<v Speaker 4>You need it.</v>

1569
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Cause they've made themselves Guinea pigs for the sake of our species.</v>

1570
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.740
<v Speaker 4>They did it cause they're enjoying it.</v>

1571
00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1572
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Well it's worse than a 50 or wait and what's,</v>

1573
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 5>what's bad about it?</v>

1574
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 5>Microphone.</v>

1575
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 5>What's bad about it?</v>

1576
00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:17.220
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1577
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.053
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

1578
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.330
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1579
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 5>what's bad about it is the fact that there are people who can afford what an</v>

1580
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 5>implant would cost.</v>

1581
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1582
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.000
<v Speaker 5>like with cell phones,</v>

1583
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:31.110
<v Speaker 5>I saw cell phones be a tool of people who had tons of money.</v>

1584
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.170
<v Speaker 5>And I saw that with every other technology.</v>

1585
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.840
<v Speaker 5>And when you're talking about modifying your body in the ways that we are</v>

1586
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 5>talking about it,</v>

1587
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:44.090
<v Speaker 5>and it seems like it has so much potential to be a useful tool for people to</v>

1588
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 5>make that something that's only available to people with large amounts of</v>

1589
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.490
<v Speaker 5>capital seems like wrong.</v>

1590
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Well then you go on,</v>

1591
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.393
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1592
00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.520
<v Speaker 4>don't curse</v>

1593
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 1>dirty address this.</v>

1594
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And quite accurately when he talks about technology being applied in the cell</v>

1595
00:46:58.471 --> 00:46:59.304
<v Speaker 1>phone world,</v>

1596
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 1>he's like it initially it was just a privileged few.</v>

1597
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 1>He goes now like 70 plus percent of the population on the planet has cell</v>

1598
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:06.990
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

1599
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 1>He can go to the jungles of Africa.</v>

1600
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>You find people have cell phones,</v>

1601
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 1>people have cell phones everywhere you look,</v>

1602
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.520
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1603
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>so it starts off like it's really expensive.</v>

1604
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.730
<v Speaker 1>But if it proves to be effective,</v>

1605
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it becomes accessible to almost everyone.</v>

1606
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 5>Which is true.</v>

1607
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.040
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1608
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1609
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.400
<v Speaker 5>but if you look at,</v>

1610
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 5>if you look at waves of technology,</v>

1611
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:25.411
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1612
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:26.580
<v Speaker 5>and the evolution of technology,</v>

1613
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:31.581
<v Speaker 5>the people that get it first get to dictate how the technology is used and they</v>

1614
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 5>get to dictate the political landscape,</v>

1615
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1616
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>

1617
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.480
<v Speaker 5>my awesome.</v>

1618
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1619
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 5>you'd look at the on users</v>

1620
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.090
<v Speaker 1>don't get to dictate the political landscape.</v>

1621
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.000
<v Speaker 1>So who has,</v>

1622
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.963
<v Speaker 1>that's the one.</v>

1623
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1624
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's not cell phone producers.</v>

1625
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about people who buy him.</v>

1626
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about people who can afford to use them.</v>

1627
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Now they're saying that they're saying that when you,</v>

1628
00:47:51.351 --> 00:47:52.580
<v Speaker 4>a cell phone is invented,</v>

1629
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.200
<v Speaker 4>when Verizon builds a cell phone,</v>

1630
00:47:54.201 --> 00:47:58.320
<v Speaker 4>they get into an agreement with the NSA and there's code inside your cell phone</v>

1631
00:47:58.321 --> 00:47:59.690
<v Speaker 4>that makes it so that it's tracking you.</v>

1632
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 4>It imagine,</v>

1633
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:01.940
<v Speaker 4>imagine,</v>

1634
00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.950
<v Speaker 4>imagine that technology applied to,</v>

1635
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.810
<v Speaker 4>to some kind of implant.</v>

1636
00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if they came up with some neuroprosthetic where,</v>

1637
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:09.261
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1638
00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:09.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1639
00:48:09.621 --> 00:48:12.710
<v Speaker 4>the neuroprosthetic that you can attach to your hippocampus that allows you to</v>

1640
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:13.760
<v Speaker 4>record your memories.</v>

1641
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if the government invents that and it has some secret code in it.</v>

1642
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:18.950
<v Speaker 4>They can shut off your brain.</v>

1643
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1644
00:48:19.441 --> 00:48:19.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's not new.</v>

1645
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:20.700
<v Speaker 1>What they were talking about,</v>

1646
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about privilege to people.</v>

1647
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.250
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about this priority.</v>

1648
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.740
<v Speaker 5>He prior to owning ownership.</v>

1649
00:48:27.741 --> 00:48:28.574
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

1650
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.523
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1651
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 5>with cell phones you have chips that,</v>

1652
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 5>that are really good at decoding video.</v>

1653
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:35.651
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

1654
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:36.484
<v Speaker 5>really good at it.</v>

1655
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 5>And they're really tiny and you know,</v>

1656
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 5>they're also kind of cheap,</v>

1657
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 5>but they're not open for everyone to you.</v>

1658
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 5>So when you have something like the raspberry Pi come along,</v>

1659
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.430
<v Speaker 5>they have to beg,</v>

1660
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.313
<v Speaker 5>what's a pie?</v>

1661
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 5>It's a handheld computer.</v>

1662
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 5>35 bucks.</v>

1663
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Does everything regular.</v>

1664
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:54.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1665
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.920
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy like that.</v>

1666
00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.430
<v Speaker 4>They like on Reddit it always pops up with something you've never heard of</v>

1667
00:48:59.431 --> 00:48:59.971
<v Speaker 4>raspberry.</v>

1668
00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:01.700
<v Speaker 4>It's just a super cheap operating</v>

1669
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.150
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

1670
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1671
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.900
<v Speaker 5>It's a super cheap computer.</v>

1672
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1673
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.450
<v Speaker 5>it's a super cheap computer.</v>

1674
00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:05.970
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1675
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.380
<v Speaker 5>it's about the size of a credit card.</v>

1676
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.130
<v Speaker 5>It does everything that computers should do.</v>

1677
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.900
<v Speaker 5>So you can get on the net,</v>

1678
00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:15.660
<v Speaker 5>you can use a to do credit card.</v>

1679
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1680
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:17.730
<v Speaker 5>it's credit card,</v>

1681
00:49:17.731 --> 00:49:18.390
<v Speaker 5>palm sized.</v>

1682
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:19.260
<v Speaker 5>It's palm sized.</v>

1683
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a screen as well.</v>

1684
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:21.240
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1685
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.730
<v Speaker 5>you need a screen keyboard.</v>

1686
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.750
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1687
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 5>whatever interfaces with the boss.</v>

1688
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 5>It's the CPU,</v>

1689
00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:28.711
<v Speaker 5>the whole deal.</v>

1690
00:49:28.711 --> 00:49:29.371
<v Speaker 5>The box itself stuff.</v>

1691
00:49:29.371 --> 00:49:29.761
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1692
00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:30.660
<v Speaker 5>That's credit card size.</v>

1693
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:36.220
<v Speaker 5>And they had to make deals with a nondisclosure agreements and make all sorts of</v>

1694
00:49:37.231 --> 00:49:41.910
<v Speaker 5>deals to attain the technology for their cell phone parts that they're using in</v>

1695
00:49:41.911 --> 00:49:44.220
<v Speaker 5>there that's not open to everyone.</v>

1696
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.241
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

1697
00:49:45.241 --> 00:49:49.650
<v Speaker 5>in that same way we believe that people will create better when they get the</v>

1698
00:49:49.651 --> 00:49:54.630
<v Speaker 5>keys to the candy store and they can actually experiment with all the parts that</v>

1699
00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:57.810
<v Speaker 5>are being used and being developed as much as possible.</v>

1700
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.330
<v Speaker 5>We want to encourage that plane and playing.</v>

1701
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:01.700
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1702
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.061
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1703
00:50:02.061 --> 00:50:02.681
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

1704
00:50:02.681 --> 00:50:04.730
<v Speaker 1>what I was concerned with more was not the,</v>

1705
00:50:04.731 --> 00:50:04.821
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1706
00:50:04.821 --> 00:50:05.654
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

1707
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1708
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that are going to profit or not profit from creating these things.</v>

1709
00:50:08.751 --> 00:50:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about people getting access to the technology itself and it seems</v>

1710
00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:13.280
<v Speaker 1>like that's inevitable.</v>

1711
00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if it's effective for rich people,</v>

1712
00:50:15.441 --> 00:50:18.770
<v Speaker 1>it will eventually trickle down to the rest of the population no matter what as</v>

1713
00:50:18.771 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 1>long as it's really worthwhile.</v>

1714
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.181
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1715
00:50:21.181 --> 00:50:26.181
<v Speaker 5>I think that when you've got a particular group of people always getting first</v>

1716
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 5>access and they can always</v>

1717
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 6>determine how it's used.</v>

1718
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:33.930
<v Speaker 6>And by the time the technology is democratized to a point where it,</v>

1719
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1720
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.820
<v Speaker 6>first advantage,</v>

1721
00:50:35.821 --> 00:50:36.654
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter,</v>

1722
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 6>then there's something else because they're sitting on the capital from the last</v>

1723
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 6>thing that came along.</v>

1724
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 6>So you've got this perpetual cycle of,</v>

1725
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:43.371
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1726
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 6>we're making it first.</v>

1727
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 6>So we always get to dictate the terms of which this,</v>

1728
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.681
<v Speaker 6>this thing,</v>

1729
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:52.340
<v Speaker 6>the legal and technical terms by which shakes this thing or this type of thing.</v>

1730
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1731
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that what ingenuity is all about and isn't that why people spend so</v>

1732
00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 1>much money on companies to try to develop products?</v>

1733
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I isn't that like sort of their mo the motivation,</v>

1734
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 1>the motivation is to capture the market place and to be able to sell this</v>

1735
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.560
<v Speaker 1>incredible thing that they've created.</v>

1736
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you're saying it should be locked down.</v>

1737
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:08.620
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1738
00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:08.841
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1739
00:51:08.841 --> 00:51:09.041
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1740
00:51:09.041 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying it shouldn't be long.</v>

1741
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1742
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying I meant locked down as in once something has created a,</v>

1743
00:51:15.091 --> 00:51:16.590
<v Speaker 1>basically it's available to everyone.</v>

1744
00:51:16.591 --> 00:51:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be available just to this one person that created it.</v>

1745
00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:20.151
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1746
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

1747
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.131
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

1748
00:51:21.131 --> 00:51:21.561
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1749
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:22.191
<v Speaker 6>I think that's,</v>

1750
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 6>that's the most ethical way to do it in,</v>

1751
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 6>in this case because,</v>

1752
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1753
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about augmenting humans,</v>

1754
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about giving them additional information about the world.</v>

1755
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:36.520
<v Speaker 6>And this is our most powerful tool ever.</v>

1756
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.670
<v Speaker 6>And so when you,</v>

1757
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about supercharging this,</v>

1758
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 6>you're giving individuals and it's a great advantage over others.</v>

1759
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 6>And with any other technology,</v>

1760
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:47.151
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1761
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 6>there's abuse.</v>

1762
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 6>If you look at nuclear technology,</v>

1763
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.013
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1764
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.980
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1765
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.680
<v Speaker 6>the Soviet Union and,</v>

1766
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:58.780
<v Speaker 6>and the United States got to dictate foreign policy for how many years because</v>

1767
00:51:59.301 --> 00:52:01.130
<v Speaker 6>they had that and other countries didn't.</v>

1768
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

1769
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 6>I personally think that that's the scale of power we're talking about when</v>

1770
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:08.820
<v Speaker 6>you're saying like neural implants and,</v>

1771
00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:11.180
<v Speaker 6>and all of these really powerful devices.</v>

1772
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 6>I think that the first people that get it get to dictate how everyone else</v>

1773
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:16.304
<v Speaker 6>plays.</v>

1774
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:17.800
<v Speaker 1>So you're essentially,</v>

1775
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.240
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is that these new technologies are going to be so powerful</v>

1776
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that once people get control of them,</v>

1777
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.210
<v Speaker 1>they'll literally be able to enslave great groups of people who don't have them.</v>

1778
00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:29.830
<v Speaker 1>They'll have power over them,</v>

1779
00:52:29.831 --> 00:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>they'll have advantage over the over them and they'll decide or could decide to</v>

1780
00:52:34.631 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 1>use that advantage to control the monopolize,</v>

1781
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>the use of these technologies,</v>

1782
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.920
<v Speaker 1>monopolize the use of these human improvements.</v>

1783
00:52:41.921 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 1>He's technological human improvements and they'll just hoard them.</v>

1784
00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 1>All of themselves.</v>

1785
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.981
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1786
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:46.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1787
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.113
<v Speaker 6>and not in any,</v>

1788
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.960
<v Speaker 1>does anybody ever done that with anything technology?</v>

1789
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody heard the technology ever for themselves?</v>

1790
00:52:52.361 --> 00:52:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if you can sell it,</v>

1791
00:52:53.741 --> 00:52:54.350
<v Speaker 1>people sell it.</v>

1792
00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:54.731
<v Speaker 6>Well it,</v>

1793
00:52:54.731 --> 00:52:55.341
<v Speaker 6>it never,</v>

1794
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:56.630
<v Speaker 6>it never lasts long,</v>

1795
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:58.110
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm talking about are the ram,</v>

1796
00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:00.880
<v Speaker 6>the social ramifications of,</v>

1797
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 6>of people trying to hold on to that for whatever.</v>

1798
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 6>Cause for example,</v>

1799
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 6>everyone,</v>

1800
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 6>every army today uses guns,</v>

1801
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 6>but we're still reeling from the cultural effects of one group of people having</v>

1802
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 6>guns and another group of people not having guns.</v>

1803
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.891
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1804
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 6>We're still reeling from,</v>

1805
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>

1806
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:18.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1807
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 6>countries hating each other and an ethnic tension and whatever.</v>

1808
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 6>So it's not,</v>

1809
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 6>it's not so much about technology,</v>

1810
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:26.454
<v Speaker 6>it's about,</v>

1811
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.380
<v Speaker 6>this is what happens when you,</v>

1812
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:31.770
<v Speaker 6>when you try to lock it down eventually it's going to spread.</v>

1813
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 6>But you're causing damage by trying to lock it down.</v>

1814
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1815
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.370
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a,</v>

1816
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1817
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1818
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny argument.</v>

1819
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting argument and it gets into a social engineering or socialism,</v>

1820
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1821
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 1>point of view where you got to go.</v>

1822
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:46.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1823
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide to distribute a technology?</v>

1824
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.050
<v Speaker 6>There are companies like ate a fruit,</v>

1825
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.030
<v Speaker 6>I ate of fruit spark fund,</v>

1826
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.280
<v Speaker 6>they're open source and they still make money.</v>

1827
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1828
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.690
<v Speaker 1>there certainly is.</v>

1829
00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

1830
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.560
<v Speaker 1>if any place embraces open source,</v>

1831
00:54:02.561 --> 00:54:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it's the Internet and technology and you know,</v>

1832
00:54:04.851 --> 00:54:09.851
<v Speaker 1>of course Linux and Unix and there's always been a whole open source community</v>

1833
00:54:09.861 --> 00:54:10.311
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

1834
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:11.600
<v Speaker 1>But to dictate that,</v>

1835
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:12.351
<v Speaker 1>that's mandatory.</v>

1836
00:54:12.351 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 1>That's where things get sketchy.</v>

1837
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.561
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1838
00:54:15.561 --> 00:54:16.011
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1839
00:54:16.011 --> 00:54:16.491
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1840
00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that I don't want a future where corporations don't sell this.</v>

1841
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I want people to have options.</v>

1842
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't totally understand what you're saying,</v>

1843
00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1844
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it goes against every other way.</v>

1845
00:54:26.181 --> 00:54:28.130
<v Speaker 1>We manage innovation and we,</v>

1846
00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the way we manage innovation,</v>

1847
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:30.380
<v Speaker 1>it's people get copyrights,</v>

1848
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>trademarks and you create something and that becomes you and then you own that</v>

1849
00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you could sell it or license it out to other people.</v>

1850
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1851
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially saying is that whenever it comes to a human benefit now,</v>

1852
00:54:39.861 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Speaker 1>no longer do you have the option.</v>

1853
00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to distribute it freely to everybody.</v>

1854
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.090
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1855
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I say like you're,</v>

1856
00:54:47.001 --> 00:54:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1857
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.140
<v Speaker 1>you're regulating like in a way that has never been regulated before.</v>

1858
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's the socialist idea.</v>

1859
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's intriguing.</v>

1860
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

1861
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1862
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.873
<v Speaker 1>it's debatable.</v>

1863
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1864
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.161
<v Speaker 1>And it's debatable,</v>

1865
00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:58.941
<v Speaker 1>but what you're,</v>

1866
00:54:58.941 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about is a sort of a mandatory type of a thing.</v>

1867
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:02.991
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1868
00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:03.191
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1869
00:55:03.191 --> 00:55:05.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't wanna I don't want to say,</v>

1870
00:55:05.211 --> 00:55:05.751
<v Speaker 6>hey Google,</v>

1871
00:55:05.751 --> 00:55:07.520
<v Speaker 6>you have to make this,</v>

1872
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:08.870
<v Speaker 6>this implant open source.</v>

1873
00:55:08.871 --> 00:55:13.340
<v Speaker 6>What I'm saying is I want a future where you can either get corporation x or you</v>

1874
00:55:13.341 --> 00:55:15.620
<v Speaker 6>can go to the open source community.</v>

1875
00:55:15.621 --> 00:55:16.454
<v Speaker 6>Be Cheap.</v>

1876
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:16.800
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1877
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that inevitable?</v>

1878
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:18.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1879
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have with cell phones.</v>

1880
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:19.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1881
00:55:19.581 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 1>you can buy an android phone or you can buy an apple phone or you can buy some</v>

1882
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 1>no name phone.</v>

1883
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1884
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:24.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1885
00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:26.700
<v Speaker 1>eventually if something is worth something,</v>

1886
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 1>people sell it to the point where you're going to have leaders in the</v>

1887
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:29.730
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>

1888
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 1>But once it has,</v>

1889
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 1>once the public has access,</v>

1890
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 1>those leaders are based in the market itself.</v>

1891
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 1>There based on what people buy,</v>

1892
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:36.781
<v Speaker 1>what they like,</v>

1893
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:37.614
<v Speaker 1>what they enjoy.</v>

1894
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>He can't monopolize if someone,</v>

1895
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1896
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 1>if everyone's selling a similar product and one person's better,</v>

1897
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:44.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that succeeds.</v>

1898
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1899
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of where we're at because of the fact that we don't just say when</v>

1900
00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>something comes along like,</v>

1901
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:51.451
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1902
00:55:51.451 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 1>everybody has access to this fuck patents,</v>

1903
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>fuck trademarks.</v>

1904
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:55.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1905
00:55:55.081 --> 00:56:00.081
<v Speaker 1>that that's literally against the way innovation has spawned human beings to</v>

1906
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:01.380
<v Speaker 1>this point in the first.</v>

1907
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.733
<v Speaker 6>But there's other,</v>

1908
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.140
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

1909
00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.160
<v Speaker 6>I think there's other motivations than capital.</v>

1910
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.220
<v Speaker 6>I think they way the motivation in this kind of technology is so much bigger</v>

1911
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:10.891
<v Speaker 6>than money.</v>

1912
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 6>What you're talking about is achieving,</v>

1913
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:14.140
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1914
00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:18.420
<v Speaker 6>the ability with technology to produce emotions or to create psychic states.</v>

1915
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:18.960
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1916
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.321
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>

1917
00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:19.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1918
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.830
<v Speaker 6>an amazing thing and that's an amazingly powerful thing.</v>

1919
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 6>So so's calling people.</v>

1920
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1921
00:56:25.001 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 6>but you know what,</v>

1922
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather have an orgasm helmet than a cell phone,</v>

1923
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.840
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

1924
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.171
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1925
00:56:30.171 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 6>it's not either or.</v>

1926
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:32.603
<v Speaker 6>It's not either or.</v>

1927
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.100
<v Speaker 6>But what I'm saying is cell phones didn't get socialized and this technology</v>

1928
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:36.934
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't either.</v>

1929
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're saying it should or shouldn't be socialized.</v>

1930
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:40.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>

1931
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:40.660
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

1932
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.470
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to make an open source version of this stuff.</v>

1933
00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 6>But if they do that for us,</v>

1934
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're going to do that before.</v>

1935
00:56:48.101 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 6>It knows what they're doing.</v>

1936
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 6>But what I'm saying is</v>

1937
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you make it,</v>

1938
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be entitled to distribute it to everybody if you want to</v>

1939
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.261
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1940
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 6>but you shouldn't be.</v>

1941
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 6>You shouldn't be forced into Detroit.</v>

1942
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:04.330
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if future of options and an end and in terms of the technology coming</v>

1943
00:57:04.331 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

1944
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:09.570
<v Speaker 6>I want the open source and the closed source to come out at the same time</v>

1945
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 6>because any,</v>

1946
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 6>any lag time between the closed source and the open source,</v>

1947
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1948
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 6>it starts to produce,</v>

1949
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:17.530
<v Speaker 6>produce problems.</v>

1950
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 6>So I want a future where people have options as to what they're going to get.</v>

1951
00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 6>And I think that we've already seen problems with,</v>

1952
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1953
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 6>with technologies being pigeonholed so that,</v>

1954
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1955
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 6>we can't have,</v>

1956
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 6>we can't not have a smartphone,</v>

1957
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 6>but we know the fuckery that's going on with smartphones.</v>

1958
00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:36.730
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1959
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:37.860
<v Speaker 6>And so there's what,</v>

1960
00:57:37.861 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 6>what do you,</v>

1961
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:39.363
<v Speaker 6>what do you do?</v>

1962
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:39.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1963
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:42.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of problems with smartphones if really want to get to the bottom</v>

1964
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:42.521
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1965
00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is they're all based on conflict minerals.</v>

1966
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 1>The real problem in smartphones is that you follow every smart phone down to its</v>

1967
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>

1968
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 1>And he got a little kid in Africa with a stick knocking rocks out of the dirt.</v>

1969
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's real.</v>

1970
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.390
<v Speaker 1>And that they can't fix that yet.</v>

1971
00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:56.403
<v Speaker 1>They really can't.</v>

1972
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do yet.</v>

1973
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.470
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1974
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 1>they need these conflict minerals and they're not available in very,</v>

1975
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 1>very many spots of the world.</v>

1976
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And the places where they can get them the cheapest,</v>

1977
00:58:04.571 --> 00:58:05.404
<v Speaker 1>that's where they get them.</v>

1978
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you have civil war in the Congo.</v>

1979
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you have people fighting over these resources.</v>

1980
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a real problem besides the innovation got a real problem in the</v>

1981
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:16.780
<v Speaker 1>morality of actually owning a cell phone because everyone who owns a cell</v>

1982
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 1>phone's a piece of shit.</v>

1983
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 1>If you really get down to the core of it.</v>

1984
00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean this just,</v>

1985
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 1>there's no way around it.</v>

1986
00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1987
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a,</v>

1988
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 1>this is an unbelievably fascinating subject and I think it's inevitable that,</v>

1989
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:27.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1990
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.690
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1991
00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:29.770
<v Speaker 1>we have this sort of discussion and the,</v>

1992
00:58:29.771 --> 00:58:34.771
<v Speaker 1>in this argument and I think what we really need is the idea of capitalism or</v>

1993
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:35.883
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

1994
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.390
<v Speaker 1>W merged with morality and ethics and humanity and in,</v>

1995
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.171
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

1996
00:58:41.171 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 1>what we usually have is he who gets to the top of the mountain,</v>

1997
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 1>kicks everybody in the face that's trying to get up and instead of like pulling</v>

1998
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:51.600
<v Speaker 1>people up with them and humanity benefiting and,</v>

1999
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.891
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2000
00:58:51.891 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 1>and sharing something like that in an open source manner because you think it's</v>

2001
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the right thing to do instead of mandating it,</v>

2002
00:58:57.881 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it almost should be a part of success itself.</v>

2003
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That success itself sort of generates a altruism.</v>

2004
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It generates happiness at generates generosity.</v>

2005
00:59:06.311 --> 00:59:06.791
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>

2006
00:59:06.791 --> 00:59:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like once you have some and you care about others you should give,</v>

2007
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:10.871
<v Speaker 1>you should help,</v>

2008
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you should boost him up and we don't have that attitude,</v>

2009
00:59:13.961 --> 00:59:14.471
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

2010
00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately we have this ultra competitive attitude which has spawned so much</v>

2011
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 1>innovation because of it,</v>

2012
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but along way it's also made a bunch of fucking assholes.</v>

2013
00:59:23.581 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2014
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 1>You know a bunch of heartless assholes just caught up in the hunt.</v>

2015
00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

2016
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.820
<v Speaker 4>don't you guys think that the,</v>

2017
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 4>it's eventually going to be impossible to keep anything private and that it's</v>

2018
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.330
<v Speaker 4>like to even the,</v>

2019
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.620
<v Speaker 4>so we're entering into a future where there is really not going to be such a</v>

2020
00:59:40.621 --> 00:59:41.850
<v Speaker 4>thing as secrets.</v>

2021
00:59:41.851 --> 00:59:45.330
<v Speaker 4>We're entering into a future where everything will eventually be leaked in some</v>

2022
00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:45.511
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2023
00:59:45.511 --> 00:59:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Everything will</v>

2024
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:46.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2025
00:59:46.711 --> 00:59:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll go you one better.</v>

2026
00:59:47.701 --> 00:59:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think money's going to be real anymore.</v>

2027
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to get to a point where there's not going to ones and Zeros</v>

2028
00:59:53.491 --> 00:59:57.460
<v Speaker 1>are not going to cut it as far as you have this and he doesn't have that and I</v>

2029
00:59:57.461 --> 01:00:02.461
<v Speaker 1>really believe that we're going to get to some weird place where just by nature</v>

2030
01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

2031
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the just the progression of technology itself,</v>

2032
01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>the dissolving of boundaries,</v>

2033
01:00:07.651 --> 01:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>the access to information ones and Zeros are all you have when it comes to</v>

2034
01:00:11.581 --> 01:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2035
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Money is just information.</v>

2036
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get to a point where the idea of the paradigm that we operate</v>

2037
01:00:16.891 --> 01:00:17.071
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

2038
01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>we think it's important.</v>

2039
01:00:18.001 --> 01:00:18.781
<v Speaker 1>I keep my stuff,</v>

2040
01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you keep your stuff,</v>

2041
01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:20.251
<v Speaker 1>I pay for this,</v>

2042
01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:21.084
<v Speaker 1>you pay for that.</v>

2043
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist anywhere else in nature.</v>

2044
01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>We've decided that this is normal.</v>

2045
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get to a point in time where you're not going to be able to lock</v>

2046
01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:29.034
<v Speaker 1>it down anymore.</v>

2047
01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to hold on to money.</v>

2048
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna mean anything.</v>

2049
01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to decide what the fuck to do with all the different shaped</v>

2050
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>

2051
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to decide who gets the food.</v>

2052
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be real anymore.</v>

2053
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.911
<v Speaker 1>It's going to,</v>

2054
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it's going to merge and do some next level shit.</v>

2055
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's the future of humanity.</v>

2056
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.491
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too.</v>

2057
01:00:44.491 --> 01:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>But then I hope people don't get lazy as fuck because of that.</v>

2058
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the reasons why people have done so well,</v>

2059
01:00:48.991 --> 01:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>which is it's also arguable whether or not doing so well as a good thing.</v>

2060
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>But one of the reasons is that we've needed to succeed in order to survive.</v>

2061
01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2062
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Can you think we got out of caves?</v>

2063
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>How do you think we didn't get killed off like neanderthal?</v>

2064
01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>How do you think we didn't become food for the prey were weak and slow.</v>

2065
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>We'd just,</v>

2066
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.881
<v Speaker 1>because we,</v>

2067
01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>we innovated and we pushed forth and we got the fuck away from all the things</v>

2068
01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:13.274
<v Speaker 1>that are dangerous.</v>

2069
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>We locked up cities,</v>

2070
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>we invented guns,</v>

2071
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>we did a lot of shit in order to make innovation possible.</v>

2072
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you go to places on the earth,</v>

2073
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>like the Amazon or like Africa,</v>

2074
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking innovation.</v>

2075
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2076
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing a piece of skin over your deck and you look for something to eat.</v>

2077
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do everyday.</v>

2078
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>You get up in the morning early and you go look for something he cause if you</v>

2079
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:30.651
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2080
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

2081
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.750
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

2082
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:32.130
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

2083
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:32.701
<v Speaker 6>my favorite,</v>

2084
01:01:32.701 --> 01:01:35.940
<v Speaker 6>my favorite example is the,</v>

2085
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:40.290
<v Speaker 6>when we started growing crops right before most of our,</v>

2086
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.470
<v Speaker 6>most of a human's time was spent looking for food.</v>

2087
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.370
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2088
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:45.660
<v Speaker 6>You didn't have time to ask,</v>

2089
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.531
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2090
01:01:46.531 --> 01:01:46.921
<v Speaker 6>mom,</v>

2091
01:01:46.921 --> 01:01:47.540
<v Speaker 6>what is that?</v>

2092
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.850
<v Speaker 6>Cause you were fucking either hunting something or running away from something</v>

2093
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 6>that was just about your entire life.</v>

2094
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.380
<v Speaker 6>When you are now growing food,</v>

2095
01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:56.551
<v Speaker 6>you're now,</v>

2096
01:01:56.551 --> 01:02:01.551
<v Speaker 6>you now have a wide space in your day where you're not doing anything,</v>

2097
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.680
<v Speaker 6>even entire seasons where you've got food stored up.</v>

2098
01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.380
<v Speaker 6>So what do you do?</v>

2099
01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.270
<v Speaker 6>You started asking questions.</v>

2100
01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:07.104
<v Speaker 6>You started making art.</v>

2101
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.360
<v Speaker 6>You start writing things down because you've got time.</v>

2102
01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:09.960
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

2103
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.960
<v Speaker 6>I think that when I think technology should be about liberating people to do</v>

2104
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 6>what they want fall,</v>

2105
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to cut you,</v>

2106
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>but what you're saying,</v>

2107
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.380
<v Speaker 6>this to me is one of the great,</v>

2108
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2109
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:23.671
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2110
01:02:23.671 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 6>naive ideas of transhumanism,</v>

2111
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.920
<v Speaker 6>which is the notion that if you remove from human beings and this then the need</v>

2112
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 6>for something.</v>

2113
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:32.821
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>

2114
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 6>because the ultimate goal of transhumanism,</v>

2115
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.210
<v Speaker 6>I think is to take the,</v>

2116
01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:41.370
<v Speaker 6>to shrink down the moment between what you can think you want and the moment of</v>

2117
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 6>having it to nothing so that you instantaneously have something,</v>

2118
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 6>whether it's by neurologically stimulating your brain in a way that's exactly</v>

2119
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 6>identical to reality.</v>

2120
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 6>So you can experience any feeling state that you want or whether it's using</v>

2121
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 6>matters simulators to build something that you've contemplated and all of</v>

2122
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.520
<v Speaker 6>humanity has been based on overcoming the obstacle between those two things.</v>

2123
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 6>But in overcoming the obstacle,</v>

2124
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 6>you gain wisdom when you're learning how to like play piano,</v>

2125
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 6>you don't just get to learn how to play piano.</v>

2126
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:14.150
<v Speaker 6>You get to learn the discipline of years and years of working to play piano and</v>

2127
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 6>suddenly we can download into someone's mind how to play piano.</v>

2128
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 6>If we remove that discipline,</v>

2129
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 6>then what Joe's saying is you end up with slugs.</v>

2130
01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.540
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>

2131
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.290
<v Speaker 6>I think no matter how hard a dog tries,</v>

2132
01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:27.820
<v Speaker 6>it can never learn calculus.</v>

2133
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.740
<v Speaker 6>There's just an upper limit.</v>

2134
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.730
<v Speaker 6>You just,</v>

2135
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.730
<v Speaker 6>no matter it can study forever and it just,</v>

2136
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.840
<v Speaker 6>it won't happen.</v>

2137
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:37.300
<v Speaker 6>And so I think that there are things that we just,</v>

2138
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.710
<v Speaker 6>as humans,</v>

2139
01:03:38.711 --> 01:03:39.544
<v Speaker 6>we just,</v>

2140
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.470
<v Speaker 6>no matter how hard we try,</v>

2141
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:42.730
<v Speaker 6>there's an upper limit.</v>

2142
01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:43.780
<v Speaker 6>And so when you begin,</v>

2143
01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:45.550
<v Speaker 6>let's say downloading information,</v>

2144
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:47.290
<v Speaker 6>there's some things you'll get easy,</v>

2145
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.250
<v Speaker 6>but there are other things that no one's ever discovered that you now have to</v>

2146
01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:54.760
<v Speaker 6>discover new ways to play that have never been even,</v>

2147
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:55.541
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2148
01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:56.530
<v Speaker 6>thought about ever.</v>

2149
01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.380
<v Speaker 6>So I think that that when you,</v>

2150
01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 6>when you augment,</v>

2151
01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.110
<v Speaker 6>when you make yourself more intelligent,</v>

2152
01:04:02.111 --> 01:04:04.060
<v Speaker 6>more capable now,</v>

2153
01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.750
<v Speaker 6>now you don't have to do hard work to do what humans can do,</v>

2154
01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:11.050
<v Speaker 6>but you still have to do hard work to do whatever.</v>

2155
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Explain it in layman's terms.</v>

2156
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>This is a technological version of Mo money.</v>

2157
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Mo problems.</v>

2158
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.411
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2159
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:19.951
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2160
01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2161
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't get make your problems far more complex like people thought.</v>

2162
01:04:24.241 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2163
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Once human beings have supermarkets and you just go with a credit card,</v>

2164
01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to bring her on a bag of gold,</v>

2165
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 1>then no one's going to be depressed.</v>

2166
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It turns out people more depressed.</v>

2167
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:35.821
<v Speaker 1>They're sad,</v>

2168
01:04:35.821 --> 01:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for meaning.</v>

2169
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not hunting and gathering their food.</v>

2170
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>They're missing all those,</v>

2171
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:40.411
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2172
01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>those rewards that are built into the human genome,</v>

2173
01:04:44.341 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't get them anymore.</v>

2174
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.373
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>

2175
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>They take Prozac and they drive fast and they watch stupid movies.</v>

2176
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Well can I put it a little money mo problems.</v>

2178
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2179
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.110
<v Speaker 4>let me put it in non layman's burning man terms.</v>

2180
01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.120
<v Speaker 4>If you'd take the Tibetan book of the dead,</v>

2181
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:01.990
<v Speaker 4>one of the Bardos or one of the hell's in the Tibetan book of the dead is called</v>

2182
01:05:01.991 --> 01:05:03.790
<v Speaker 4>the Hell of hungry ghosts.</v>

2183
01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.050
<v Speaker 4>And what this hell is,</v>

2184
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:10.030
<v Speaker 4>is these beings living in this weird place have this infinite appetite and</v>

2185
01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:13.930
<v Speaker 4>anything they can think of to eat immediately appears in front of them.</v>

2186
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.540
<v Speaker 4>So they have the combination of always being hungry,</v>

2187
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.080
<v Speaker 4>mixed in,</v>

2188
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 4>being able to instantaneously</v>

2189
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 6>create any food that they want and that creates a health state where all they're</v>

2190
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 6>doing is feeding and eating to try to quench this endless human appetite.</v>

2191
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 6>Now obviously we're really far away.</v>

2192
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Probably coming though.</v>

2193
01:05:30.871 --> 01:05:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you wanted to think of something that someone would invent,</v>

2194
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that's without doubt inside the realm of possibility.</v>

2195
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>We already have boner pills for old dudes on a pill.</v>

2196
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.340
<v Speaker 1>The on their deathbed,</v>

2197
01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>they chomped down a couple of pills and they got us Zombie talked.</v>

2198
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>We already have that.</v>

2199
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me they're not going to have something where it just keeps your</v>

2200
01:05:48.781 --> 01:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>hunger going.</v>

2201
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:49.981
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2202
01:05:49.981 --> 01:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you never get satisfied.</v>

2203
01:05:51.211 --> 01:05:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You'll be hungry all the time.</v>

2204
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite thing to do?</v>

2205
01:05:53.551 --> 01:05:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it eat mine too?</v>

2206
01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be great if you were hungry always and you can just be a</v>

2207
01:05:58.531 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 1>professional eater all day.</v>

2208
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:02.971
<v Speaker 1>Fast food.</v>

2210
01:06:02.971 --> 01:06:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about what people had done to their lips.</v>

2211
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:05.483
<v Speaker 1>People would do that.</v>

2212
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:09.210
<v Speaker 1>People blown up their lips putting magnets in their fingers.</v>

2213
01:06:09.211 --> 01:06:09.900
<v Speaker 1>No offense.</v>

2214
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.950
<v Speaker 1>They would definitely do that.</v>

2215
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.580
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2216
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 6>I think that that,</v>

2217
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:14.330
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

2218
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 6>if that's something a negative about the human condition.</v>

2219
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 6>I mean if,</v>

2220
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 6>if we have that technology at some point,</v>

2221
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 6>then we would also have the technology to change it.</v>

2222
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.700
<v Speaker 6>And that's another discussion whether we should get rid of the hedonic</v>

2223
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 6>treadmill.</v>

2224
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:28.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2225
01:06:28.271 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure that it's a negative.</v>

2226
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:30.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a,</v>

2227
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a pattern.</v>

2228
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2229
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever it took to get humans to this point in history,</v>

2230
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever it took to get us to what we are now,</v>

2231
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible process.</v>

2232
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean from whatever we were from multi-celled organisms on to this thing with</v>

2233
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:47.674
<v Speaker 1>laptops,</v>

2234
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>that process is insane.</v>

2235
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that that process just changes because we add a chip and you know,</v>

2236
01:06:56.021 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2237
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:56.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a no,</v>

2238
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.131
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be,</v>

2239
01:06:57.131 --> 01:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be like a growing phase and then it's going to become something</v>

2240
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:02.380
<v Speaker 1>new just like it became this.</v>

2241
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.800
<v Speaker 1>If this is unrecognizable to some crazy Nana tall 50,000 years ago and it's what</v>

2243
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 1>we will be 50,000 years from now,</v>

2244
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it's probably unrecognizable to us.</v>

2245
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2246
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 1>and whether it happens slowly or quickly.</v>

2247
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 1>What has happened in our lifetime,</v>

2248
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.410
<v Speaker 1>man did the idea of of the Internet,</v>

2249
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 1>it crept up on us so damn quick that we all just accepted as a fact.</v>

2250
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you brought any other time in history,</v>

2251
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>it's the most insane piece of sorcery and magic the world has ever known.</v>

2252
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Just 20 years ago it would have been insane conquering,</v>

2253
01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:36.550
<v Speaker 1>conquering a dragon.</v>

2254
01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:40.170
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you could have a little little glass box and your posture and</v>

2255
01:07:40.171 --> 01:07:41.470
<v Speaker 1>answers all your questions,</v>

2256
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

2257
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 1>You could send messages,</v>

2258
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>including video from people to people all around the world.</v>

2259
01:07:46.121 --> 01:07:46.811
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2260
01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it since the credible and it's just a part of our accepted</v>

2261
01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>everyday life slowly happen slowly or quickly,</v>

2262
01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 1>whether it'd be,</v>

2263
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:53.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2264
01:07:53.561 --> 01:07:54.161
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

2265
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:56.170
<v Speaker 1>We think of it slowly in the course of human history.</v>

2266
01:07:56.171 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive burst of innovation.</v>

2267
01:07:58.061 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>But in our lifetimes it's been 10 20 years and then boom,</v>

2268
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.081
<v Speaker 1>it's all here.</v>

2269
01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:04.480
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you're going to stop it,</v>

2270
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2271
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:05.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2272
01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:09.250
<v Speaker 1>or that we should even resist the next level is it seems pretty silly.</v>

2273
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I just can't resist it.</v>

2274
01:08:10.781 --> 01:08:11.710
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop it.</v>

2275
01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to sit around and go,</v>

2276
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is it going to be?</v>

2277
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:16.630
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets weird.</v>

2279
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:16.971
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:08:16.971 --> 01:08:17.191
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2281
01:08:17.191 --> 01:08:17.901
<v Speaker 6>and we don't know,</v>

2282
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 6>but no,</v>

2283
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.393
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2284
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that,</v>

2285
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2286
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 6>primitive man could have put a person on the moon if they were still worrying</v>

2287
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 6>about catching that pig.</v>

2288
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2289
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:30.231
<v Speaker 6>Whatever,</v>

2290
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 6>whatever aspirations we will have in 10,000 years,</v>

2291
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:35.030
<v Speaker 6>we won't get to that if,</v>

2292
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.490
<v Speaker 6>if we don't do certain things.</v>

2293
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2294
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:38.731
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2295
01:08:38.731 --> 01:08:40.430
<v Speaker 6>and I think that a part of,</v>

2296
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:41.323
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2297
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 6>a part of humanity that I think we should keep is our need to explore and</v>

2298
01:08:45.111 --> 01:08:45.741
<v Speaker 6>understand.</v>

2299
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 6>And I think that if we're still worrying about,</v>

2300
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2301
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 6>getting cancer at 60,</v>

2302
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.430
<v Speaker 6>we're not going to get it</v>

2303
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:51.850
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2304
01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2305
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable,</v>

2306
01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but we still keep exploring.</v>

2307
01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

2308
01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2309
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that's why we're here.</v>

2310
01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole part of the whole thing.</v>

2311
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:01.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around that.</v>

2312
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got a video to show us.</v>

2313
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:04.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2315

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:17.883
<v Speaker 1>Slapped that up.</v>

2325
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2326
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:19.144
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

2327
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2328
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.940
<v Speaker 1>This is Tim.</v>

2329
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.223
<v Speaker 1>This is Tim.</v>

2330
01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2331
01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.350
<v Speaker 1>What's what?</v>

2332
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

2333
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:30.250
<v Speaker 1>What's that sound?</v>

2334
01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

2335
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Pause that.</v>

2336
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.253
<v Speaker 1>Pause that.</v>

2337
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Why does it sound like that?</v>

2338
01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.470
<v Speaker 1>What kind of soundtrack is on that?</v>

2339
01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:36.701
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>

2340
01:09:36.701 --> 01:09:37.534
<v Speaker 1>Kill the sound.</v>

2341
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Just play that because obviously there's something going on behind it.</v>

2342
01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.640
<v Speaker 1>We might even be a movie.</v>

2343
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.503
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2344
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:44.170

<v Speaker 1>They were to around touching lawn mowers.</v>

2348
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.191

<v Speaker 5>does tattoo work and he specializes in doing subdermal stuff.</v>

2355
01:09:58.210 --> 01:09:59.043
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2356
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Shitty tattoos.</v>

2357
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Never trusted tattoo artists was shitty.</v>

2358
01:10:02.201 --> 01:10:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Taxes cause a thing called old laser tattoo removal sun looking into it.</v>

2359
01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Never trust a surgeon was shitty.</v>

2360
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Tattoos,</v>

2361
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.420
<v Speaker 1>especially on his face.</v>

2362
01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Tazzy surgeons with tattoos on their face.</v>

2363
01:10:13.841 --> 01:10:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Boy Floyd,</v>

2364
01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go under and 10,</v>

2365
01:10:16.571 --> 01:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>nine I to fuck you man.</v>

2366
01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:17.791
<v Speaker 1>Your ass.</v>

2367
01:10:17.791 --> 01:10:18.624
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

2368
01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:20.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2369
01:10:20.261 --> 01:10:25.261
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is cutting and he's inserting this magnet into this dude's</v>

2370
01:10:26.261 --> 01:10:26.891
<v Speaker 1>fingertip.</v>

2371
01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:27.490
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2372
01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.211
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

2373
01:10:28.211 --> 01:10:28.511
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2374
01:10:28.511 --> 01:10:29.770
<v Speaker 1>very tiny magnet.</v>

2375
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Well how,</v>

2377
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:31.990
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe it?</v>

2378
01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:35.320
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a BB that's been split into like sixes,</v>

2379
01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2380
01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:36.940
<v Speaker 1>That's all small looks.</v>

2381
01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.710
<v Speaker 5>It's about two millimeters wide.</v>

2382
01:10:38.711 --> 01:10:40.150
<v Speaker 5>It's a little gel that's bigger than I thought.</v>

2383
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>

2384
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.430
<v Speaker 5>maybe a little less than two millimeters</v>

2385
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.780
<v Speaker 1>cause that looks really tiny.</v>

2386
01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a perspective,</v>

2387
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2388
01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:45.851
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

2389
01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:46.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2390
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>

2391
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:48.310
<v Speaker 1>but that looks like,</v>

2392
01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.690
<v Speaker 1>well under a millimeter.</v>

2393
01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.460
<v Speaker 1>What's the charge for this procedure?</v>

2394
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Three guys crazy.</v>

2395
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2396
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.300
<v Speaker 1>100% free talks you up,</v>

2397
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:59.230
<v Speaker 1>stick shit in your fingertips and that's who you get</v>

2398
01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:00.280
<v Speaker 5>stuffed down from.</v>

2399
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2400
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.930
<v Speaker 5>it'd be pretty reasonable.</v>

2401
01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:05.680
<v Speaker 5>It'd be a bargain price anywhere between 75 and one 50.</v>

2402
01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Just like most subdermal uh,</v>

2403
01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:08.973
<v Speaker 5>body mods.</v>

2404
01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:10.271
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2405
01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:10.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2406
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about the future,</v>

2407
01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.890
<v Speaker 1>when you guys sit around and you,</v>

2408
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you bring up what's on the horizon,</v>

2409
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>what's like the big theoretical on the horizon as to have anything to do with</v>

2410
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of technology that we see in Google glass being incorporated in</v>

2411
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a normal sort of a thing.</v>

2412
01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:29.380
<v Speaker 6>So there was a,</v>

2413
01:11:29.381 --> 01:11:32.200
<v Speaker 6>there was a paper put out a few months ago about,</v>

2414
01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2415
01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:36.940
<v Speaker 6>connecting two minds of rodents.</v>

2416
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.163
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2417
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 6>and so there was one road and if I'm not mistaken in Virginia and there was</v>

2418
01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.640
<v Speaker 6>another road and somewhere in Brazil and they put this chip into the,</v>

2419
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.590
<v Speaker 6>into the brains of these two mice and put them through an obstacle course.</v>

2420
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.850
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2421
01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:55.091
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2422
01:11:55.091 --> 01:11:57.880
<v Speaker 6>with a US roughly 60 to 70%,</v>

2423
01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:58.923
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2424
01:11:59.230 --> 01:11:59.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2425
01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:00.760
<v Speaker 6>crossover rate,</v>

2426
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.980
<v Speaker 6>the other mouse actually learned,</v>

2427
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:04.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2428
01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:06.490
<v Speaker 6>the obstacle course of the other mouse.</v>

2429
01:12:06.491 --> 01:12:07.324
<v Speaker 6>It was connected to.</v>

2430
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you know if that's been done without chips though?</v>

2431
01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Rupert Sheldrake wrote a whole book about it.</v>

2432
01:12:11.241 --> 01:12:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It's called the morphic field and a morphic residence.</v>

2433
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.021
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2434
01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:15.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2435
01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.010
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book,</v>

2436
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2437
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 1>about a dog's knowing when their owners are coming home and uh,</v>

2438
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.120
<v Speaker 1>people being able to tell when people look at the back of their heads.</v>

2439
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's a fascinating sort of a theory,</v>

2440
01:12:25.131 --> 01:12:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2441
01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:26.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2442
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:27.590
<v Speaker 1>he showed that,</v>

2443
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's been verified 100%,</v>

2444
01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2445
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but I know he wrote that he showed that if you teach a rat in one place,</v>

2446
01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:37.250
<v Speaker 1>a maze that rat somewhere else,</v>

2447
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.850
<v Speaker 1>another part of the world will learn that similar maize or that same May.</v>

2448
01:12:40.851 --> 01:12:41.684
<v Speaker 1>It's quicker,</v>

2449
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:42.950
<v Speaker 1>statistically quicker.</v>

2450
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2451
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:45.830
<v Speaker 1>They've also shown that chimpanzees,</v>

2452
01:12:45.831 --> 01:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>once they started venting,</v>

2453
01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:47.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2454
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.620
<v Speaker 1>things to do with tools,</v>

2455
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:49.761
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

2456
01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:49.881
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2457
01:12:49.881 --> 01:12:51.080
<v Speaker 1>they've demonstrated like,</v>

2458
01:12:51.081 --> 01:12:51.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2459
01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:52.040
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2460
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.311
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2461
01:12:52.311 --> 01:12:57.311
<v Speaker 1>an orangutan in Africa learned how to spear fish by watching people do it.</v>

2462
01:12:57.321 --> 01:12:58.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a picture of this thing doing it.</v>

2463
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It's all a motherfucker.</v>

2464
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing ever.</v>

2465
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2466
01:13:02.271 --> 01:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>other rang,</v>

2467
01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:03.830
<v Speaker 1>started doing it too.</v>

2468
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:04.661
<v Speaker 1>They once,</v>

2469
01:13:04.661 --> 01:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>once they start learning things,</v>

2470
01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:08.120
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's in the ether.</v>

2471
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

2472
01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:09.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:13:09.411 --> 01:13:11.930
<v Speaker 4>This is a ring of Tang separated geographically.</v>

2474
01:13:11.931 --> 01:13:13.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they could observe each other.</v>

2475
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:14.690
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know about orangutans,</v>

2476
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.411
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

2477
01:13:15.411 --> 01:13:15.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2478
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.660
<v Speaker 4>the bice definitely separated geographically.</v>

2479
01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.090
<v Speaker 4>That's what's odd about it.</v>

2480
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:19.851
<v Speaker 4>But you know what,</v>

2481
01:13:19.851 --> 01:13:20.181
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2482
01:13:20.181 --> 01:13:20.331
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2483
01:13:20.331 --> 01:13:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's that they're learning,</v>

2484
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.540
<v Speaker 4>they learn it and then it travels somehow through space.</v>

2485
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.350
<v Speaker 4>I think the evolution sort of groves through us,</v>

2486
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.011
<v Speaker 4>do you know what I mean?</v>

2487
01:13:31.011 --> 01:13:31.521
<v Speaker 4>Like it's our,</v>

2488
01:13:31.521 --> 01:13:31.791
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2489
01:13:31.791 --> 01:13:34.810
<v Speaker 4>it's something that's growing through humanity is,</v>

2490
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.180
<v Speaker 4>are these new innovation.</v>

2491
01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:40.610
<v Speaker 4>So it's not as though one orangutan figured it out and send out a signal.</v>

2492
01:13:40.611 --> 01:13:44.680
<v Speaker 4>It's as though this was just a new phase that was coming through this form of</v>

2493
01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:45.491
<v Speaker 4>that's very possible.</v>

2494
01:13:45.491 --> 01:13:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2495
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but the Orangutang initially I,</v>

2496
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I've confused these two stories pretty badly,</v>

2497
01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.131
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2498
01:13:51.131 --> 01:13:51.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2499
01:13:51.281 --> 01:13:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the mice learned in separate parts of the world,</v>

2500
01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>separate parts of,</v>

2501
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:55.301
<v Speaker 1>they weren't connected,</v>

2502
01:13:55.301 --> 01:13:57.400
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a thousand miles or a hundred miles,</v>

2503
01:13:57.401 --> 01:13:58.234
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

2504
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:59.380
<v Speaker 1>but the rank Tang,</v>

2505
01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:02.410
<v Speaker 1>we're watching people and the orangutan started imitating people,</v>

2506
01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>so they did directly imitating human beings.</v>

2507
01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:09.490
<v Speaker 1>But if you really stop and think about when human beings used to be essentially</v>

2508
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 1>very similar to orangutans,</v>

2509
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>it was probably only like a couple of million years ago.</v>

2510
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2511
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a long time to us,</v>

2512
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but in the span of the universe,</v>

2513
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>that ain't shit.</v>

2514
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that a chimp could eventually,</v>

2515
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 1>if they kept moving along and slowly innovating and changing and finding magic</v>

2516
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and learning how to make fires with rocks,</v>

2517
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they could eventually become some kind of a human thing.</v>

2518
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2519
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 1>we didn't use to be people.</v>

2520
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

2521
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean pretty much established.</v>

2522
01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not like all of a sudden we popped up in this form,</v>

2523
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:40.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2524
01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>figuring out always shit.</v>

2525
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get away from leopards that we,</v>

2526
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2527
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.790
<v Speaker 1>we became this like slowly and steadily.</v>

2528
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just the timeframe for us.</v>

2529
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre to wrap our heads around with an 80 plus year lifespan to try to</v>

2530
01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 1>understand what a 10 million year period of development is.</v>

2531
01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>We can't really,</v>

2532
01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 1>we can't get our head into that.</v>

2533
01:14:58.511 --> 01:14:58.811
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

2534
01:14:58.811 --> 01:14:59.920
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what that means.</v>

2535
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And 10 million years from now with this stuff.</v>

2536
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.730
<v Speaker 1>When he gets to that weird exponential technology thing that's going on right</v>

2537
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2538
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be unrecognizable a hundred years from now.</v>

2539
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2540
01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.170
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what I feel like Lucas is getting at.</v>

2541
01:15:13.171 --> 01:15:18.171
<v Speaker 5>By creating an actual in a pathway between two minds or between many minds that</v>

2542
01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:25.020
<v Speaker 5>we can control using principles we already understand.</v>

2543
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2544
01:15:27.181 --> 01:15:31.620
<v Speaker 5>Intuition the way I know the way in electrons going to travel.</v>

2545
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.750
<v Speaker 5>I know the way in electrons going to travel.</v>

2546
01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:34.584
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2547
01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:36.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't get intuition that way.</v>

2548
01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.720
<v Speaker 5>So if we can create chips where I can have something in the back of my head and</v>

2549
01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:45.530
<v Speaker 5>I go like this and Lucas is like stop scratching your arm cause I feel it.</v>

2550
01:15:45.531 --> 01:15:46.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2551
01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 5>like that's,</v>

2552
01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.810
<v Speaker 5>that's like that's an SRO</v>

2553
01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:50.280
<v Speaker 1>touching your butt.</v>

2554
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.513
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2555
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Like sitting around your house all of a sudden,</v>

2556
01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:55.910
<v Speaker 1>no Lucas stop.</v>

2557
01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2558
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.691
<v Speaker 1>you're on a date.</v>

2559
01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:01.740
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to keep it together.</v>

2560
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.800
<v Speaker 1>You could get hacked with that kind of technology somebody could hack into seems</v>

2561
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:08.251
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

2562
01:16:08.251 --> 01:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Just like you get those.</v>

2563
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Like someone hacked Twitter today and I must've got a thought.</v>

2564
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting a thousand fake tweets about diet and exercise.</v>

2565
01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:18.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2566
01:16:18.271 --> 01:16:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I look so good for summer because I started doing this.</v>

2567
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.241
<v Speaker 1>Like those,</v>

2568
01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:22.200
<v Speaker 1>those bots,</v>

2569
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.420
<v Speaker 1>a Bot got through and just infected.</v>

2570
01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:29.640
<v Speaker 5>I think the benefit of having a bunch of people develop their own technologies</v>

2571
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:30.720
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2572
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.411
<v Speaker 5>Well No.</v>

2573
01:16:31.411 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 5>If you're developing your own technologies for your own implants,</v>

2574
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 5>there is some sort of,</v>

2575
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.880
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of level of of security like some people use macs because hey</v>

2576
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:45.810
<v Speaker 5>macs don't get viruses the way pcs do because people who want to write viruses</v>

2577
01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.540
<v Speaker 5>are targeting pcs cause there's more pcs around.</v>

2578
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a blinking oasis in the desert.</v>

2579
01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to stop anything from getting hacked.</v>

2580
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that,</v>

2581
01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>well first of all we've learned about the NSA and spying.</v>

2582
01:16:58.941 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 1>It's already shown that there's that you can't,</v>

2583
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:01.371
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop it.</v>

2584
01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:04.490
<v Speaker 1>They've already got algorithms in place already copy and all your emails because</v>

2585
01:17:04.491 --> 01:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2586
01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.570
<v Speaker 1>because of bottle bottle,</v>

2587
01:17:06.571 --> 01:17:08.600
<v Speaker 1>net technology because it,</v>

2588
01:17:08.601 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>because can't invent</v>

2589
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.873
<v Speaker 6>our own internet.</v>

2590
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.943
<v Speaker 6>There is,</v>

2591
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:17.020
<v Speaker 6>we can only use that internet and that Internet goes through certain filters</v>

2592
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 6>you'd use also because these fucking corporations have given in to their</v>

2593
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 6>overlords and giving up the information.</v>

2594
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:22.970
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's it.</v>

2595
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 6>And that's really where it comes down to.</v>

2596
01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:25.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to live,</v>

2597
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to live in a future where I've got artificial organs and all of the</v>

2598
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:32.480
<v Speaker 6>information from that is being pumped out to some who the fuck knows.</v>

2599
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:33.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2600
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel comfortable with that.</v>

2601
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:35.683
<v Speaker 6>I want,</v>

2602
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.630
<v Speaker 6>I want that information to belong to me at least,</v>

2603
01:17:38.631 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 6>so that I can do what it with what I want.</v>

2604
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2605
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't want any advertisements because my liver is doing whatever or I don't</v>

2606
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 6>want people to be able to shut off my liver,</v>

2607
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:48.681
<v Speaker 6>my liver,</v>

2608
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 6>cause I'm not being a good citizen.</v>

2609
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:52.820
<v Speaker 6>Imagine the Second Ethan Hawke Movie.</v>

2610
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 6>There'd be no Snowden.</v>

2611
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.100
<v Speaker 6>When his brain would have melted out of his nose by now,</v>

2613
01:17:58.101 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 6>they just turned him up,</v>

2614
01:17:59.150 --> 01:17:59.331
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2615
01:17:59.331 --> 01:17:59.841
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

2616
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 6>You guys had to take a leak.</v>

2617
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.431
<v Speaker 6>Go ahead.</v>

2618
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Go to the coconut water.</v>

2619
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:03.840
<v Speaker 6>Crushes me every time.</v>

2620
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2621
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:06.530
<v Speaker 6>where,</v>

2622
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 6>where do you think the end game is when it comes to all this bio hacking stuff?</v>

2623
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 6>What's,</v>

2624
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.360
<v Speaker 6>what's,</v>

2625
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 6>what's the end game like?</v>

2626
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:14.810
<v Speaker 6>Where do you hope that it all winds up?</v>

2627
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 6>Do you have like a man and I hope by the time I'm x years old I can fly.</v>

2628
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2629
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.551
<v Speaker 6>is there a,</v>

2630
01:18:21.551 --> 01:18:22.730
<v Speaker 6>is there something like that</v>

2631
01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.290
<v Speaker 5>I can go first.</v>

2632
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I see an end game as,</v>

2633
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.350
<v Speaker 5>as something way larger than people screwing with their body.</v>

2634
01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.220
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2635
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.053
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2636
01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:36.480
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole bunch of different technologies that are happening all at once.</v>

2637
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:41.760
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that we don't have no resources on this planet to support the</v>

2638
01:18:41.761 --> 01:18:46.761
<v Speaker 5>population growth and the amount of people that we do have and those sorts of</v>

2639
01:18:47.701 --> 01:18:48.720
<v Speaker 5>things add together.</v>

2640
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I feel like when you look at a company like space x and what space x is doing</v>

2641
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.321
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2642
01:18:55.321 --> 01:18:59.190
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that all these technologies are leading towards longer lives,</v>

2643
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2644
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.770
<v Speaker 5>the guy who's doing soylent,</v>

2645
01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:02.041
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2646
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:02.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2647
01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.920
<v Speaker 5>food substitute guy of those dudes,</v>

2648
01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.133
<v Speaker 5>dudes in New York,</v>

2649
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:07.920
<v Speaker 5>really awesome science stuff.</v>

2650
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.371
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:19:08.371 --> 01:19:09.450
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it a drank it,</v>

2652
01:19:09.451 --> 01:19:09.691
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2653
01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:10.524
<v Speaker 5>what am I drinking?</v>

2654
01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.550
<v Speaker 5>And I think all that adds together and I think that,</v>

2655
01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:15.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2656
01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:18.720
<v Speaker 5>when we have so many people and we're living a longer time and we have the</v>

2657
01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:21.930
<v Speaker 5>ability to print anything we can conceive,</v>

2658
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:25.170
<v Speaker 5>then maybe it's time for us to start moving out to space.</v>

2659
01:19:25.171 --> 01:19:30.171
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's time that we can handle 20 years over to somewhere where we'll be</v>

2660
01:19:31.081 --> 01:19:35.670
<v Speaker 5>doing heavy construction work in zero g so that other people can come there and</v>

2661
01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:39.030
<v Speaker 5>live and be smarter and move forward from there.</v>

2662
01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's time to start space colonization and</v>

2663
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.980
<v Speaker 6>space colonization.</v>

2664
01:19:42.981 --> 01:19:43.814
<v Speaker 6>That's where we're gone.</v>

2665
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 6>It'd be going to be,</v>

2666
01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 6>Cyborg is here for us.</v>

2667
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 6>He could be like,</v>

2668
01:19:48.021 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 6>download your consciousness into a robot and send the robot in the space.</v>

2669
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 6>I honestly think plastic brain,</v>

2670
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.660
<v Speaker 6>it's the smartest way to do it is to be a side where if you're going into space,</v>

2671
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 6>so what I've been saving everything in space is,</v>

2672
01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:03.400
<v Speaker 6>is trying to kill a biological organism.</v>

2673
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:04.243
<v Speaker 6>They can't,</v>

2674
01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2675
01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2676
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.110
<v Speaker 6>apes in a tin can,</v>

2677
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:06.944
<v Speaker 6>won't cut it.</v>

2678
01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:07.993
<v Speaker 6>I said what I'm saying.</v>

2679
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2680
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 6>and I think being able to withstand all of the crazy space,</v>

2681
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 6>weather,</v>

2682
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.491
<v Speaker 6>space,</v>

2683
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 6>condition.</v>

2684
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2685
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>The conditions are insane.</v>

2686
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:17.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2687
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:17.631
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2688
01:20:17.631 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 1>the temperature is instantly death if you step outside,</v>

2689
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.380
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a pressure suit,</v>

2690
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>if you get hit by any sort of a solar flare or asteroid,</v>

2691
01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

2692
01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:27.011
<v Speaker 6>Were,</v>

2693
01:20:27.011 --> 01:20:27.340
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>

2694
01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.170
<v Speaker 6>were too fragile even for this planet.</v>

2695
01:20:29.171 --> 01:20:31.210
<v Speaker 6>That's why we've got this stuff on us.</v>

2696
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.040
<v Speaker 6>And I think motorcycle jackets and shit.</v>

2697
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:33.953
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.960
<v Speaker 6>The idea of,</v>

2699
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:35.740
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2700
01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2701
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:38.890
<v Speaker 6>colonizing space as this,</v>

2702
01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.180
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's,</v>

2703
01:20:40.181 --> 01:20:40.410
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2704
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 6>it's too dangerous.</v>

2705
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you foresee a future where we really do download our consciousness into some</v>

2706
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of an artificial human being?</v>

2707
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.343
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2708
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:49.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2709
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:50.563
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2710
01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't know enough about the technology to say anything definite.</v>

2711
01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.360
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's a cool idea,</v>

2712
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.990
<v Speaker 6>but I've never seen anything compelling,</v>

2713
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:01.123
<v Speaker 6>compelling,</v>

2714
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:01.880
<v Speaker 6>so I can't,</v>

2715
01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:02.713
<v Speaker 6>I can't really say</v>

2716
01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:03.821
<v Speaker 1>it's a mind fuck.</v>

2717
01:21:03.821 --> 01:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2718
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of like a little,</v>

2719
01:21:06.851 --> 01:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>you a little Lucas running around,</v>

2720
01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:11.830
<v Speaker 1>made out of rubber and it's you,</v>

2721
01:21:11.831 --> 01:21:13.360
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness is in this thing.</v>

2722
01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>It's out there touching things and moving stuff around.</v>

2723
01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2724
01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And also that you could duplicate a Lucas.</v>

2725
01:21:19.391 --> 01:21:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could download a Lucas,</v>

2726
01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>then you're Lucas getting up on the on pirate bay.</v>

2727
01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.790
<v Speaker 1>People could just be downloading you and then sending you pictures of their</v>

2728
01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Lucas that they've put in some kind of habitrail.</v>

2729
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>But that would definitely be another.</v>

2730
01:21:32.081 --> 01:21:32.890
<v Speaker 1>That would be another loop</v>

2731
01:21:32.890 --> 01:21:36.540
<v Speaker 6>guess so because once you start generating independent memories,</v>

2732
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.390
<v Speaker 6>I think you start having different emotions,</v>

2733
01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 6>different thoughts about things.</v>

2734
01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:41.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:42.620
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be really weird.</v>

2736
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Unless they all interface somehow or another together,</v>

2737
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.881
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2738
01:21:46.881 --> 01:21:47.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2739
01:21:47.091 --> 01:21:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

2740
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:49.070
<v Speaker 1>which I mean it is possible,</v>

2741
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:49.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2742
01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're dealing with,</v>

2743
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:51.200
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2744
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sending someone a video or talking to someone through facetime or</v>

2745
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Skype in real time off your phone seems like the dumbest,</v>

2746
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:00.740
<v Speaker 1>the craziest thing ever.</v>

2747
01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that couldn't be possible.</v>

2748
01:22:01.731 --> 01:22:02.780
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't even on Star Trek.</v>

2749
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:04.880
<v Speaker 1>They never even figured that out on Star Trek.</v>

2750
01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:05.714
<v Speaker 1>But it's real.</v>

2751
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:10.870
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you and your three clones or whatever they are could be</v>

2752
01:22:10.881 --> 01:22:15.770
<v Speaker 1>experiencing life simultaneously and that you could multitask and that the mind</v>

2753
01:22:15.771 --> 01:22:18.080
<v Speaker 1>may evolve to concentrate on one person or the other.</v>

2754
01:22:18.081 --> 01:22:19.610
<v Speaker 1>These two sleep or these two are out,</v>

2755
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2756
01:22:20.331 --> 01:22:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing two different things at the same time and aware,</v>

2757
01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.110
<v Speaker 1>tuning into either one,</v>

2758
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:25.551
<v Speaker 1>whatever you choose.</v>

2759
01:22:25.551 --> 01:22:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta like touching your leg with your left hand while you're writing</v>

2760
01:22:27.891 --> 01:22:28.850
<v Speaker 1>something with your right hand.</v>

2761
01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.380
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a problem man.</v>

2762
01:22:30.381 --> 01:22:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have swarms of individuals.</v>

2763
01:22:33.141 --> 01:22:37.060
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be Rogan swarms like kingus Khan,</v>

2764
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:38.140
<v Speaker 1>like Gingiss cons,</v>

2765
01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:42.110
<v Speaker 1>responsible for like something like 5% of the population's DNA cause they just,</v>

2766
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2767
01:22:42.561 --> 01:22:46.280
<v Speaker 1>he went on a party and spraying the 12 hundreds and the whole world has never</v>

2768
01:22:46.281 --> 01:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>recovered.</v>

2769
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2770
01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're doing that artificially stuff that's that powerful.</v>

2771
01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:54.320
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it becomes really important.</v>

2772
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Who has control of that technology and the initial five.</v>

2773
01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:58.700
<v Speaker 1>But how do you enforce that?</v>

2774
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a race.</v>

2775
01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a race.</v>

2776
01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:01.971
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

2777
01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:02.804
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2778
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:04.123
<v Speaker 1>What about them?</v>

2779
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>About it's cough cause that's where he wants to create is this whole army.</v>

2780
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys,</v>

2781
01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to create an army?</v>

2782
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.633
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2783
01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:12.990
<v Speaker 6>not an army army,</v>

2784
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:14.430
<v Speaker 6>but a whole group of people.</v>

2785
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.350
<v Speaker 6>He does live forever.</v>

2786
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2787
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:18.791
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

2788
01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:19.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2789
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to the global future 20,</v>

2790
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:22.750
<v Speaker 1>45 conference?</v>

2791
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2792
01:23:23.111 --> 01:23:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I know about the 2045 guys.</v>

2793
01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think about that?</v>

2794
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.863
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2795
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.460
<v Speaker 6>I like that,</v>

2796
01:23:29.461 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2797
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:33.360
<v Speaker 6>that they're working towards a solid project,</v>

2798
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:33.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2799
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:36.030
<v Speaker 6>because that's kind of rare in the transhumanist community.</v>

2800
01:23:36.031 --> 01:23:41.031
<v Speaker 6>There's just a lot of Scifi talk way too much,</v>

2801
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.593
<v Speaker 1>just too much.</v>

2802
01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:43.693
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

2803
01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Discontent and the transhumanist community debating on how to handle this</v>

2804
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:49.180
<v Speaker 1>correctly of know what the fuck he's doing,</v>

2805
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:50.014
<v Speaker 1>what his robots.</v>

2806
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2807
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:51.810
<v Speaker 6>I liked,</v>

2808
01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:54.870
<v Speaker 6>I liked the fact that they have a goal that they're working towards.</v>

2809
01:23:54.871 --> 01:23:55.590
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

2810
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:57.660
<v Speaker 6>I fear that,</v>

2811
01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.593
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2812
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.830
<v Speaker 6>there'll be a particular group of people that'll,</v>

2813
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:05.040
<v Speaker 6>that'll get it and then just fuck us for eternity.</v>

2814
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 1>That's your big fear,</v>

2815
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:10.000
<v Speaker 1>your big fear of someone else getting ahold of the goods first and not giving</v>

2816
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you the super chip.</v>

2817
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.040
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2818
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.360
<v Speaker 6>I fear about the type of people that'll,</v>

2819
01:24:14.361 --> 01:24:19.361
<v Speaker 6>that'll get it first because the world didn't fair well when a particular people</v>

2820
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:21.050
<v Speaker 6>set of people got the gun first.</v>

2821
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.560
<v Speaker 6>That wasn't good for a lot of the human species.</v>

2822
01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2823
01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:26.910
<v Speaker 1>it was good for us though.</v>

2824
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.111
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're here,</v>

2825
01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:28.501
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2826
01:24:28.501 --> 01:24:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That's how you sitting on the Internet and I know with a plastic microphone in</v>

2827
01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:32.730
<v Speaker 1>front of you sucked out of the earth.</v>

2828
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I would verted from oil.</v>

2829
01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:34.861
<v Speaker 1>I would rather,</v>

2830
01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I would rather not have to move forward with that sort of contention and</v>

2831
01:24:38.911 --> 01:24:41.060
<v Speaker 1>fighting and just pee.</v>

2832
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:41.431
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2833
01:24:41.431 --> 01:24:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think is that inevitable with enlightenment.</v>

2834
01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have w w w whether or not we've achieved enlightenment,</v>

2835
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:48.811
<v Speaker 1>we certainly haven't,</v>

2836
01:24:48.811 --> 01:24:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but at the highest levels of humanity,</v>

2837
01:24:50.281 --> 01:24:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I think people are probably more aware and tuned in today than at any other time</v>

2838
01:24:54.451 --> 01:24:59.040
<v Speaker 1>in history and it's probably way safer today than any other time in history.</v>

2839
01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's a lot of crazy shit that goes down on a regular basis.</v>

2840
01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.720
<v Speaker 1>If you compared your everyday life to that.</v>

2841
01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:08.160
<v Speaker 1>If someone living in Siberia in the 12 hundreds in the Mongols came storming in</v>

2842
01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2843
01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.720
<v Speaker 1>we live a lot better.</v>

2844
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty pretty God damn good.</v>

2845
01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2846
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think that a big part of that is technology and the access to information,</v>

2847
01:25:16.381 --> 01:25:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the access to information is freer than ever before.</v>

2848
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Technology more powerful than ever before.</v>

2849
01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Hence people are safer and people were more moral.</v>

2850
01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that and I think the idea of people being moral is more</v>

2851
01:25:28.561 --> 01:25:32.820
<v Speaker 1>accepted as not just something that has to be enforced in order to keep the</v>

2852
01:25:32.821 --> 01:25:33.151
<v Speaker 1>peace,</v>

2853
01:25:33.151 --> 01:25:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's something that's beneficial and something that you would should</v>

2854
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:37.381
<v Speaker 1>strive for.</v>

2855
01:25:37.381 --> 01:25:38.214
<v Speaker 1>It's admirable.</v>

2856
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that that really meant it might not have existed on such a mass scale in</v>

2857
01:25:42.241 --> 01:25:42.721
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

2858
01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.310
<v Speaker 1>even in the past 20 or 30 years.</v>

2859
01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I think we're dealing with like pretty unprecedented times and it sounds like</v>

2860
01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:50.190
<v Speaker 1>really super,</v>

2861
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2862
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.541
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>

2863
01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:55.860
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like one of the byproducts of this technology that we're all</v>

2864
01:25:55.861 --> 01:26:00.450
<v Speaker 1>experiencing is that we're experiencing a sort of mini enlightenment and a a</v>

2865
01:26:00.451 --> 01:26:02.700
<v Speaker 1>burst of enlightenment because of this information.</v>

2866
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>If that is the case,</v>

2867
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that this kind of technology,</v>

2868
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>that it sort of dissolves more boundary.</v>

2869
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to lead to a constriction of the people that utilize</v>

2870
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:14.271
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2871
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to lead to a freedom of the species itself.</v>

2872
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that.</v>

2873
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that if I look at the,</v>

2874
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the trend,</v>

2875
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:25.400
<v Speaker 1>even though everybody wants to think the sky is falling,</v>

2876
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.810
<v Speaker 1>the trend is an indicate that,</v>

2877
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that the sky is falling for some people in some spots and the apocalypse is</v>

2878
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

2879
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.201
<v Speaker 1>if you live in,</v>

2880
01:26:32.201 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 1>in the Congo,</v>

2881
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're in Liberia,</v>

2882
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:35.360
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse is today.</v>

2883
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 1>That's Mad Max,</v>

2884
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2885
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:38.780
<v Speaker 1>That's going on right now.</v>

2886
01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:39.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2887
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but the trend for us here,</v>

2888
01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously not in that direction.</v>

2889
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like there's always going to be a worst case scenario on this</v>

2890
01:26:46.461 --> 01:26:47.120
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

2891
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but that worst case scenario is far better today than it's ever been in history.</v>

2892
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And the best case scenario was completely nonexistent.</v>

2893
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Even in science fiction novels,</v>

2894
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 1>it's going in that way.</v>

2895
01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:00.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop it.</v>

2896
01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:00.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2897
01:27:00.581 --> 01:27:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Wait until one of these,</v>

2898
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:03.230
<v Speaker 4>one of these people in Venice,</v>

2899
01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.410
<v Speaker 4>swarm of Nano,</v>

2900
01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:07.420
<v Speaker 4>it goes flying out of their basement devouring toddlers.</v>

2901
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2902
01:27:08.110 --> 01:27:11.980
<v Speaker 4>the thing is like I liked the toddlers Sandler.</v>

2903
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:13.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a fun word to say.</v>

2904
01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:14.020
<v Speaker 4>It's your thing.</v>

2905
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.070
<v Speaker 4>You always go with dead baby,</v>

2906
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.033
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2907
01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:16.631
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2908
01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.970
<v Speaker 4>I think that when you're talking about this kind of stuff,</v>

2909
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.690
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2910
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.280
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about acceleration.</v>

2911
01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I think you're talking about a technological acceleration and wherever there's</v>

2912
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.120
<v Speaker 4>acceleration,</v>

2913
01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 4>there's an increased chance of hurting yourself.</v>

2914
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:31.270
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a skateboard going a few miles per hour,</v>

2915
01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:31.961
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

2916
01:27:31.961 --> 01:27:33.580
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a skateboard going downhill,</v>

2917
01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 4>you can wipe out.</v>

2918
01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:35.081
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2919
01:27:35.081 --> 01:27:40.081
<v Speaker 4>humanity is on this technological skateboard that's exponentially accelerating</v>

2920
01:27:40.481 --> 01:27:41.830
<v Speaker 4>and in that way,</v>

2921
01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.060
<v Speaker 4>the role of the individual becomes more and more and more intense,</v>

2922
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.980
<v Speaker 4>which means that with this kind of stuff,</v>

2923
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:52.630
<v Speaker 4>when the individual has access to the kind of technology that they have today,</v>

2924
01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.280
<v Speaker 4>they can do a ton of damage.</v>

2925
01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Look what happened with those freaks.</v>

2926
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.750
<v Speaker 4>All they needed was a pressure cooker and some ball bearings and they</v>

2927
01:27:59.050 --> 01:27:59.920
<v Speaker 4>permanently,</v>

2928
01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2929
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:04.630
<v Speaker 4>they killed so many people and traumatize so many others in the same way.</v>

2930
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Five years from now.</v>

2931
01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.430
<v Speaker 4>What happens with when people have access to this kind of stuff,</v>

2932
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:09.880
<v Speaker 4>it is day.</v>

2933
01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.713
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2934
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:12.280
<v Speaker 4>We are setting ourselves up,</v>

2935
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.250
<v Speaker 4>but for your time</v>

2936
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:18.250
<v Speaker 1>about very unique in individual circumstances in comparison to the 7 billion</v>

2937
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:21.380
<v Speaker 1>people experiencing things completely differently all around the world.</v>

2938
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:26.030
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that you're dealing with 7 billion people that have access to the</v>

2939
01:28:26.031 --> 01:28:27.030
<v Speaker 1>internet or at least a,</v>

2940
01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 1>a good percentage of them and have their stories being told.</v>

2941
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>So you're hearing about instances all over the world simultaneously.</v>

2942
01:28:35.451 --> 01:28:36.284
<v Speaker 1>All at once.</v>

2943
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>We're not designed for that were designed to take in information from our local</v>

2944
01:28:40.761 --> 01:28:41.420
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

2945
01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>were designed to take information from all these abandoned dudes are about a</v>

2946
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:46.760
<v Speaker 1>mile away on foot and they're coming here to fuck our women.</v>

2947
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>

2948
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're supposed to deal with.</v>

2949
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.460
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to deal with a story about a guy in Switzerland and fucked</v>

2950
01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:53.294
<v Speaker 1>his pig to death.</v>

2951
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2952
01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you know you're not supposed to deal with this guy in Detroit.</v>

2953
01:28:56.781 --> 01:28:57.421
<v Speaker 1>This got a,</v>

2954
01:28:57.421 --> 01:28:59.590
<v Speaker 1>a fake bigfoot in his cooler,</v>

2955
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.473
<v Speaker 1>the outback.</v>

2956
01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:00.900
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

2957
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 1>these are all,</v>

2958
01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2959
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2960
01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.060
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2961
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:03.631
<v Speaker 2>this is just,</v>

2962
01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:08.631
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with so many human beings and impossible number of 7 billion and</v>

2963
01:29:09.121 --> 01:29:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you're getting information from vast number of those people.</v>

2964
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>So you're always going to get these freaks you're always going to get.</v>

2965
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's still the trend.</v>

2966
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:19.520
<v Speaker 2>The overall trend batter is way better than it's ever.</v>

2967
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.410
<v Speaker 6>And I agree with you there.</v>

2968
01:29:21.411 --> 01:29:21.780
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2969
01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.040
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2970
01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.040
<v Speaker 6>my hope would be that we become more ethical before we get the power to cause</v>

2971
01:29:27.711 --> 01:29:28.161
<v Speaker 6>damage.</v>

2972
01:29:28.161 --> 01:29:28.850
<v Speaker 6>So we,</v>

2973
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:30.830
<v Speaker 6>even though we're more ethical now,</v>

2974
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:35.690
<v Speaker 6>any ethical mishap at this point would be a lot more disastrous.</v>

2975
01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:39.920
<v Speaker 6>It's not so bad when the most powerful weapon you have is a sword.</v>

2976
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2977
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:41.340
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2978
01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not true cause [inaudible] 70 million people doing worse than a</v>

2979
01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:47.260
<v Speaker 2>sword and a lot of people,</v>

2980
01:29:47.261 --> 01:29:48.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of other dudes with them,</v>

2981
01:29:48.261 --> 01:29:49.730
<v Speaker 2>but they did it with horses,</v>

2982
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:50.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2983
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.261
<v Speaker 2>70 million.</v>

2984
01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Any ball over his lifetime with horses.</v>

2985
01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:57.821
<v Speaker 2>But the scenario is you have three d printers and let's imagine three d printers</v>

2986
01:29:57.981 --> 01:29:58.850
<v Speaker 2>in 200 years,</v>

2987
01:29:58.851 --> 01:30:02.270
<v Speaker 2>where now you can like molecularly assemble stuff and somewhere along this 200</v>

2988
01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:04.300
<v Speaker 2>years someone discovered anti-matter.</v>

2989
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2990
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So let's imagine that there's a way someone could create a anti-matter that when</v>

2991
01:30:09.441 --> 01:30:10.400
<v Speaker 2>it met,</v>

2992
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:12.440
<v Speaker 2>matter would dissolve the universe.</v>

2993
01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say there's an imaginary technology.</v>

2994
01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.210
<v Speaker 2>They could open up a note side of what's going to happen.</v>

2995
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:20.540
<v Speaker 2>A few people are going to die and then it's going to force everyone to learn how</v>

2996
01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:24.760
<v Speaker 2>to be really nice to everyone because everyone can create a fucking anti-matter</v>

2997
01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:26.300
<v Speaker 2>bomb in their computer.</v>

2998
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:26.781
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>

2999
01:30:26.781 --> 01:30:27.260
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

3000
01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:27.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3001
01:30:27.411 --> 01:30:27.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>

3002
01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:28.610
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hope.</v>

3003
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:29.241
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

3004
01:30:29.241 --> 01:30:32.500
<v Speaker 2>They sale well on population is a polite population.</v>

3005
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3006
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way to take it to the complete next level,</v>

3007
01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:40.880
<v Speaker 2>black holes all throughout our planet that were created by assholes.</v>

3008
01:30:40.881 --> 01:30:44.780
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to hop over on our way to seven 11 there's a black hole over</v>

3009
01:30:44.781 --> 01:30:45.170
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3010
01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3011
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3012
01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:46.973
<v Speaker 2>Something</v>

3013
01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.460
<v Speaker 6>humanism that people don't talk enough about,</v>

3014
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.430
<v Speaker 6>I think is making people more ethical.</v>

3015
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:55.760
<v Speaker 6>I think there's only talk of making people more capable and intelligent.</v>

3016
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.490
<v Speaker 6>That's an implicitly,</v>

3017
01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:01.010
<v Speaker 6>there is no talk of making people nicer for the sake of just living in a,</v>

3018
01:31:01.011 --> 01:31:03.920
<v Speaker 6>in a more sane world because we're nice now.</v>

3019
01:31:03.921 --> 01:31:07.760
<v Speaker 6>But what happens if infrastructure goes away and they become hungry again and</v>

3020
01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:10.040
<v Speaker 6>we've got lots of weapons around what happens?</v>

3021
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.300
<v Speaker 6>And it would,</v>

3022
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:16.300
<v Speaker 6>it would take a longer period to build back up in this state rather than if we</v>

3023
01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:21.080
<v Speaker 6>were nicer and had forethought instead of having hunger automatically take over</v>

3024
01:31:21.081 --> 01:31:21.501
<v Speaker 6>and be like,</v>

3025
01:31:21.501 --> 01:31:21.711
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3026
01:31:21.711 --> 01:31:22.341
<v Speaker 6>fuck that guy.</v>

3027
01:31:22.341 --> 01:31:23.174
<v Speaker 6>He has food.</v>

3028
01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.073
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3029
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.890
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

3030
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:28.160
<v Speaker 6>I think that we should start having a discussion about,</v>

3031
01:31:28.330 --> 01:31:28.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3032
01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:30.950
<v Speaker 6>making people more ethical,</v>

3033
01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:31.761
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3034
01:31:31.761 --> 01:31:32.051
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3035
01:31:32.051 --> 01:31:37.051
<v Speaker 6>and be able to empathize with even other species because who knows,</v>

3036
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:38.323
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3037
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:42.590
<v Speaker 6>who knows what we will run into in the future and that might be important.</v>

3038
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting that you brought that up because that was something that</v>

3039
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Dimitri Itzkoff actually touched on in the conversation that I had with him,</v>

3040
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:52.320
<v Speaker 2>where he was talking about that being an important part of this whole movement</v>

3041
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.970
<v Speaker 2>and that the movement wasn't just about achieving some new technological state.</v>

3042
01:31:55.990 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's about Everlane elevating humanity as a whole overall.</v>

3043
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was really interesting that he is taking that into</v>

3044
01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:04.631
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

3045
01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why in this global future,</v>

3046
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 1>25 2045 um,</v>

3047
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.511
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was,</v>

3048
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:10.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3049
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.441
<v Speaker 1>Global Future,</v>

3050
01:32:11.441 --> 01:32:13.690
<v Speaker 1>2045 conference that he had,</v>

3051
01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>he brought in a lot of religious and spiritual leaders to sort of ask some</v>

3052
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>questions of these different face to try to get an understanding of what their</v>

3053
01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:25.680
<v Speaker 1>philosophies were and how they would incorporate this sort of new impending</v>

3054
01:32:26.531 --> 01:32:27.460
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

3055
01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Is transhumanism idea,</v>

3056
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 1>had it w were it to come to fruition.</v>

3057
01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It was really pretty fascinating stuff.</v>

3058
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3059
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.760
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just take it from the technological standpoint,</v>

3060
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 1>it's cough really delve.</v>

3061
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:42.280
<v Speaker 1>He dove into the psychological and the spiritual aspects of it as well,</v>

3062
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was a unique and admirable and probably pretty important.</v>

3063
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 1>If this thing moves further,</v>

3064
01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:49.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have some brick,</v>

3065
01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:50.560
<v Speaker 1>real ethical questions.</v>

3066
01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.410
<v Speaker 1>We develop immortal cyber beings with skin made out of spider webs.</v>

3067
01:32:55.411 --> 01:32:55.811
<v Speaker 1>Silk.</v>

3068
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:56.710
<v Speaker 1>That's bulletproof.</v>

3069
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:59.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's already,</v>

3070
01:32:59.051 --> 01:32:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that's common.</v>

3071
01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.513
<v Speaker 1>The track team anymore.</v>

3072
01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:01.181
<v Speaker 1>They're already there.</v>

3073
01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He figured out how to do that.</v>

3074
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3075
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the transhumanist,</v>

3076
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:04.684
<v Speaker 1>the Mormon,</v>

3077
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

3078
01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:08.893
<v Speaker 1>that's a real thing.</v>

3079
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying gays for Jesus.</v>

3080
01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3081
01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

3082
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:12.581
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

3083
01:33:12.581 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 1>There is humanist Mormonism subset of the Mormon community.</v>

3084
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:18.730
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you're willing to be in a Mormon,</v>

3085
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking willing to be anything.</v>

3086
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of who rings your doorbell first.</v>

3087
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.613
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3088
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like just to sit them down and talk them into anything.</v>

3089
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.500
<v Speaker 1>You're a Mormon.</v>

3090
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 1>We believe a 14 year old,</v>

3091
01:33:27.881 --> 01:33:28.031
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

3092
01:33:28.031 --> 01:33:33.031
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Smith in 1820 found golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus</v>

3093
01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:35.770
<v Speaker 1>and only he could read him cause he had a magic rock.</v>

3094
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 1>No wonder whether afraid of gay marriage,</v>

3095
01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:38.943
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

3096
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.300
<v Speaker 1>because if someone could talk into being a Mormon,</v>

3097
01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they can talk in a blowing them too.</v>

3098
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the job that's right out of my standup.</v>

3099
01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:46.431
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

3100
01:33:46.431 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 1>He got me doing my own material.</v>

3101
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.533
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3102
01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you are the,</v>

3103
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of a movement right now,</v>

3104
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.580
<v Speaker 1>whether you call it grinders,</v>

3105
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 1>a transhumanism or whatever,</v>

3106
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of a movement where you're focusing on a very specific thing.</v>

3107
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.790
<v Speaker 1>You're focusing on incorporating technology into the body to improve the body</v>

3108
01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:07.240
<v Speaker 1>and as long as you're focusing on that and as long as there's a whole community</v>

3109
01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 1>focusing on that,</v>

3110
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:11.990
<v Speaker 1>whether or not now it's just magnets and the fingers is everybody's poo poo in</v>

3111
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.461
<v Speaker 1>it and saying,</v>

3112
01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:16.900
<v Speaker 1>what's the big deal is going to come a time where it's a lot more than that.</v>

3113
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's some new invention of something that has absolutely no a rejection</v>

3114
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:23.321
<v Speaker 1>in the human body,</v>

3115
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:24.970
<v Speaker 1>so you can add all kinds of things,</v>

3116
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.250
<v Speaker 1>whether that some new technology comes along that radically enhances perception,</v>

3117
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:34.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it's visual or hearing or thinking cognitive function.</v>

3118
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 1>The ability to read each other's minds.</v>

3119
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 1>As long as you both have the chip,</v>

3120
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.051
<v Speaker 1>it's all going to happen,</v>

3121
01:34:38.051 --> 01:34:38.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3122
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't text message someone who doesn't have a phone.</v>

3123
01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.101
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

3124
01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:42.851
<v Speaker 1>But if they have a phone,</v>

3125
01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:43.930
<v Speaker 1>you can text him pretty easy.</v>

3126
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And once we all have something like that in our head and it's like your phone</v>

3127
01:34:48.581 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 1>will work with your friends' phones.</v>

3128
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh Em Gee,</v>

3129
01:34:51.161 --> 01:34:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at you right now and I'm writing this down.</v>

3130
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:53.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3131
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be those moments where we,</v>

3132
01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>we hit some next level that we didn't see common.</v>

3133
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Just like we didn't see the internet comment.</v>

3134
01:34:59.901 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 2>We didn't see cell phones come in.</v>

3135
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 2>No one saw that shit coming again.</v>

3136
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Even star track.</v>

3137
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:05.910
<v Speaker 2>They had a fucking walkie-talkie.</v>

3138
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3139
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Perk out.</v>

3140
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3141
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like say that to shut it.</v>

3142
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:10.243
<v Speaker 2>It'll flip it open.</v>

3143
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:11.083
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

3144
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 2>They didn't see iPads.</v>

3145
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any of that shit.</v>

3146
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>And you guys are right on the crest of the wave.</v>

3147
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Right on the crest of the technological tsunami.</v>

3148
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Getting sucked into the singularity is,</v>

3149
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:25.400
<v Speaker 2>we're all getting torn towards that waterfall.</v>

3150
01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:27.770
<v Speaker 2>You guys are in the canoes at the very front,</v>

3151
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 2>how far would you be willing to take it if someone came up with some real Steve</v>

3152
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.331
<v Speaker 2>Austin?</v>

3153
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 2>$6 million man arms and legs.</v>

3154
01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 2>They just had a saw your shit off and put on some new ones.</v>

3155
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Would you be down if you knew if were like a whole bunch.</v>

3156
01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 2>It was like fake tits where everybody was doing it.</v>

3157
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.200
<v Speaker 2>If it got to that point,</v>

3158
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess everyone was doing it,</v>

3159
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.193
<v Speaker 2>we'd all do it.</v>

3160
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:48.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3161
01:35:48.461 --> 01:35:51.650
<v Speaker 2>It came up to like a woman in the 18 hundreds oh it came up to a pilgrim or</v>

3162
01:35:51.651 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 2>something and said,</v>

3163
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3164
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

3165
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I like when you look like,</v>

3166
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:56.600
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking,</v>

3167
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3168
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.580
<v Speaker 2>some bags of water,</v>

3169
01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:00.620
<v Speaker 2>a surgically implanted under your breasts.</v>

3170
01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 2>You know you get a lot more attention around the tax bags.</v>

3171
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:06.420
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even have this bag,</v>

3172
01:36:06.421 --> 01:36:07.280
<v Speaker 2>didn't have plastic,</v>

3173
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but they would think you're fucking crazy.</v>

3174
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to think,</v>

3175
01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean is that US looking at the future about like it's going to be standard.</v>

3176
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Like you still have your arms and legs.</v>

3177
01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3178
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:16.750
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

3179
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:17.583
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

3180
01:36:17.650 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3181
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3182
01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 2>that'd be the end of rape.</v>

3183
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's just fucking super robot retro thing though to have them fight off</v>

3184
01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:25.724
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

3185
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:26.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3186
01:36:26.071 --> 01:36:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that Richard Gums in the cubs and expression of yourself kind of the way</v>

3187
01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 2>that body modification is already.</v>

3188
01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3189
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Why would I replace perfectly good arms and legs when I could have extra or</v>

3190
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:41.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe something that ingredient,</v>

3191
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:44.780
<v Speaker 2>see greedy motherfucker trying to give me a super body like,</v>

3192
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:44.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3193
01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:47.510
<v Speaker 2>but I have those three dicks but by the way,</v>

3194
01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:48.131
<v Speaker 2>then you got it.</v>

3195
01:36:48.131 --> 01:36:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Arms for us would be great if Shava maybe that's what she was all about me.</v>

3196
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:52.723
<v Speaker 2>That is the feature.</v>

3197
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 2>A futuristic holy shit.</v>

3198
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought of that.</v>

3199
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what that was all about.</v>

3200
01:36:56.690 --> 01:36:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Some crazy transhumanists from the past.</v>

3201
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they figured it out a long time ago and they're just barely wrote it down.</v>

3202
01:37:02.811 --> 01:37:03.644
<v Speaker 2>They were so high,</v>

3203
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>the road down like they were still a few passages in the Bhagavad Gita and then</v>

3204
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:08.930
<v Speaker 2>went back to eat mushrooms.</v>

3205
01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Hold on 600 is that what it says?</v>

3206
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.420
<v Speaker 2>But I do like that you ask somebody who has magnets under his hands.</v>

3207
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 2>If he had replaced his arms with the robot arms,</v>

3208
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 2>the answer was yes,</v>

3209
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 2>of course you would do it.</v>

3210
01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:24.160
<v Speaker 2>And even even if no one else was doing,</v>

3211
01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 2>if you couldn't enjoy like foot massages anymore,</v>

3212
01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 2>would you replace your legs?</v>

3213
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.430
<v Speaker 2>If they were just numb,</v>

3214
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:30.950
<v Speaker 2>they were numb but awesome like jumping over buildings,</v>

3215
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>running 60 miles an hour,</v>

3216
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 2>but they were numb.</v>

3217
01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:33.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3218
01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel good massage.</v>

3219
01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.353
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that</v>

3220
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:39.643
<v Speaker 2>you feel nothing?</v>

3221
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it has to be a uh,</v>

3222
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 2>a trade off.</v>

3223
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I might have to be,</v>

3224
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:47.210
<v Speaker 2>but if you keep your cock and balls but the bottom of your sack is numb.</v>

3225
01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>The only way you can feel your balls if someone squeezes them,</v>

3226
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:53.480
<v Speaker 2>but the legs on down fake as fuck.</v>

3227
01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Super powerful Pistons and</v>

3228
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:56.551
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

3229
01:37:56.551 --> 01:37:57.384
<v Speaker 1>nuclear power</v>

3230
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:58.241
<v Speaker 4>jump over tree.</v>

3231
01:37:58.241 --> 01:38:01.810
<v Speaker 4>You're saying I could jump over trees but my falls are not all in the bottom.</v>

3232
01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.070
<v Speaker 4>The bottom of your balls or no?</v>

3233
01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3234
01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll take all the way to that.</v>

3235
01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:16.030
<v Speaker 1>You think you would be willing to go through an operation of it removes your</v>

3236
01:38:16.031 --> 01:38:16.360
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

3237
01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:16.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3238
01:38:16.511 --> 01:38:18.580
<v Speaker 1>what if they get operations like look,</v>

3239
01:38:18.581 --> 01:38:22.300
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago you just something like a fake tit would,</v>

3240
01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably die if someone tried to do that to you.</v>

3241
01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.200
<v Speaker 1>You would die just from the fact they didn't know how to sterilize you.</v>

3242
01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:30.280
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have any way of putting you under.</v>

3243
01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Sure it was.</v>

3244
01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It would be nothing today,</v>

3245
01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.450
<v Speaker 1>but back then it was a serious,</v>

3246
01:38:34.451 --> 01:38:35.140
<v Speaker 1>serious thing.</v>

3247
01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Today girls go back to work in a couple of days.</v>

3248
01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.860
<v Speaker 1>The idea on the why,</v>

3249
01:38:38.861 --> 01:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to fake tits.</v>

3250
01:38:39.911 --> 01:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find a nonsexist way of approaching this and far as male</v>

3251
01:38:43.811 --> 01:38:44.590
<v Speaker 1>enhancement,</v>

3252
01:38:44.590 --> 01:38:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but I can't find anything that's a standard as the craziness of Male,</v>

3253
01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 1>a female breast enhancement.</v>

3254
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:50.500
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirdest things.</v>

3255
01:38:50.501 --> 01:38:51.334
<v Speaker 1>Human beings still,</v>

3256
01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.230
<v Speaker 1>but tried to,</v>

3257
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:56.530
<v Speaker 1>if we get to some point where amputating legs,</v>

3258
01:38:56.531 --> 01:39:00.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like nothing and we're replacing with an artificial one superpower.</v>

3259
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Think that the difference between a breast implant and fake leg,</v>

3260
01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:05.381
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3261
01:39:05.381 --> 01:39:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Is that already my knees are given out already.</v>

3262
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

3263
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:12.370
<v Speaker 4>my legs are going to wear out.</v>

3264
01:39:12.371 --> 01:39:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Stop right there.</v>

3265
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I had three tests.</v>

3266
01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Three kids rather it you to chicks tits who's had three kids.</v>

3267
01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.331
<v Speaker 4>Everything wears out,</v>

3268
01:39:19.331 --> 01:39:19.661
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3269
01:39:19.661 --> 01:39:20.530
<v Speaker 4>We're made out of flesh.</v>

3270
01:39:20.590 --> 01:39:20.861
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3271
01:39:20.861 --> 01:39:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Would've been way better if I said it's mother missed opportunity.</v>

3272
01:39:23.861 --> 01:39:24.694
<v Speaker 4>We stumbled.</v>

3273
01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:25.900
<v Speaker 4>We do wear out.</v>

3274
01:39:25.901 --> 01:39:26.740
<v Speaker 4>You're totally right.</v>

3275
01:39:26.741 --> 01:39:28.330
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing different between those two.</v>

3276
01:39:28.331 --> 01:39:29.440
<v Speaker 4>But we were out.</v>

3277
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3278
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:32.530
<v Speaker 4>When we did eventually your choice,</v>

3279
01:39:32.531 --> 01:39:36.490
<v Speaker 4>it might be shitty legs or better legs</v>

3280
01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:38.710
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the fix the fix the um,</v>

3281
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:40.550
<v Speaker 1>under sac and you know,</v>

3282
01:39:40.551 --> 01:39:44.060
<v Speaker 1>come up with some new technology that even though the under sac is artificial,</v>

3283
01:39:44.061 --> 01:39:45.740
<v Speaker 1>it has sensors and it sends it,</v>

3284
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:51.290
<v Speaker 4>I would just like everybody here to stop pretending that if they had super</v>

3285
01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:52.730
<v Speaker 4>powerful robot legs,</v>

3286
01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't get your legs amputated and replace.</v>

3287
01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:56.160
<v Speaker 4>If I see what,</v>

3288
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be worried about the fact that they're numb.</v>

3289
01:39:57.951 --> 01:39:58.850
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing,</v>

3290
01:39:58.851 --> 01:39:59.450
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3291
01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:01.340
<v Speaker 4>I would want someone to do it for jumping over.</v>

3292
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Treat people already working on that.</v>

3293
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:05.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3294
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.960
<v Speaker 4>the field your face.</v>

3295
01:40:05.961 --> 01:40:06.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3296
01:40:06.141 --> 01:40:08.510
<v Speaker 4>That feel people already an end.</v>

3297
01:40:08.511 --> 01:40:13.160
<v Speaker 4>We're working towards a more sensitive prosthetics that you can feel more.</v>

3298
01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:13.910
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3299
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:15.710
<v Speaker 4>And you can pretty soon.</v>

3300
01:40:15.711 --> 01:40:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping that you can even dial it so that if you're going to do something</v>

3301
01:40:18.981 --> 01:40:20.180
<v Speaker 4>dangerous or painful,</v>

3302
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:21.830
<v Speaker 4>you can dial the pain down,</v>

3303
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:22.670
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3304
01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:24.860
<v Speaker 4>It becomes optional at that point.</v>

3305
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.510
<v Speaker 4>It why would you keep these?</v>

3306
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:27.440
<v Speaker 4>These aren't modular.</v>

3307
01:40:27.441 --> 01:40:28.490
<v Speaker 4>You can't switch them.</v>

3308
01:40:28.491 --> 01:40:29.390
<v Speaker 4>They don't rotate.</v>

3309
01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3310
01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3311
01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.251
<v Speaker 4>Why would you?</v>

3312
01:40:31.251 --> 01:40:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3313
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Because they feel good when you hold someone's hands,</v>

3314
01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.611
<v Speaker 4>but you can,</v>

3315
01:40:34.611 --> 01:40:36.700
<v Speaker 4>you can always put over a layer of,</v>

3316
01:40:36.701 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 4>of soft stuff.</v>

3317
01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:37.960
<v Speaker 4>Why</v>

3318
01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.660
<v Speaker 1>not just pretend you're alive and jump off a bridge?</v>

3319
01:40:40.690 --> 01:40:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's at what point in time do we end this?</v>

3320
01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3321
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.770
<v Speaker 1>You get your whole body is going to be this fake robot body and you're needing</v>

3322
01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:51.640
<v Speaker 1>to take what is the memories of your life and your consciousness and download</v>

3323
01:40:51.641 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>them into some computer chip and then the sh the you rots and this dream you</v>

3324
01:40:56.531 --> 01:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>goes wandering around to get batteries run out.</v>

3325
01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3326
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Thinking you're really living on a farm with the Waltons.</v>

3327
01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3328
01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a stupid thing with a battery.</v>

3329
01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:06.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what the fuck's going on with your life.</v>

3330
01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you're some,</v>

3331
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.400
<v Speaker 1>you're like holding hands on the beach and getting foot massages while all of us</v>

3332
01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:16.150
<v Speaker 1>are bounding through the universe jumping over buildings,</v>

3333
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just playing devil's advocate,</v>

3334
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but there always are those people that want to hold everything back and go what?</v>

3335
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there was those assholes that we were listening to.</v>

3336
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Science has yet to explain how a seed becomes a beautiful flower and the spa.</v>

3337
01:41:32.411 --> 01:41:32.951
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3338
01:41:32.951 --> 01:41:34.780
<v Speaker 1>actually it has dummy.</v>

3339
01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3340
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we were listening to these,</v>

3341
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:39.100
<v Speaker 1>some of these religious people talking at that conference were just there.</v>

3342
01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>The ideas were so stupid and antiquated can lean on to the the mysteries that</v>

3343
01:41:44.651 --> 01:41:45.610
<v Speaker 1>have already been solved,</v>

3344
01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but in what we were talking about before,</v>

3345
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:49.960
<v Speaker 1>those mysteries that have been solved,</v>

3346
01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 1>when we do understand the mechanism behind the seed becoming a flower,</v>

3347
01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.880
<v Speaker 1>make it even more fascinating because even though we understand the process now,</v>

3348
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:58.600
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

3349
01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.231
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3350
01:41:59.231 --> 01:42:00.070
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

3351
01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Before it used to be a while.</v>

3352
01:42:02.231 --> 01:42:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That flower is beautiful.</v>

3353
01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 1>What a mystery.</v>

3354
01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad God brought this to my life.</v>

3355
01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:07.961
<v Speaker 1>Now we're like,</v>

3356
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:08.860
<v Speaker 1>isn't this incredible?</v>

3357
01:42:08.861 --> 01:42:12.760
<v Speaker 1>This seed got oxygen and then minerals from the soil and then it converts it</v>

3358
01:42:12.761 --> 01:42:16.330
<v Speaker 1>into energy and then it's photosynthesis and it grows and then the flowers</v>

3359
01:42:16.331 --> 01:42:16.720
<v Speaker 1>blooms.</v>

3360
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.620
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

3361
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole process behind it is like,</v>

3362
01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like so mind boggling and enriching and as a human being,</v>

3363
01:42:24.611 --> 01:42:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that like really jazzes us up when we learn new shit,</v>

3364
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 1>when we discover new shit,</v>

3365
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:30.880
<v Speaker 1>it's part of like the,</v>

3366
01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 1>like when you tell someone something,</v>

3367
01:42:32.321 --> 01:42:32.441
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3368
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:33.041
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3369
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:33.874
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

3370
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking earlier today about this,</v>

3371
01:42:35.741 --> 01:42:36.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3372
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:37.300
<v Speaker 1>this discovery,</v>

3373
01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:37.841
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3374
01:42:37.841 --> 01:42:38.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3375
01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

3376
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:39.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3377
01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:39.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3378
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3379
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Germany and in Germany and America,</v>

3380
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they have discovered this new type of animal that used to be like a,</v>

3381
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 1>an ancestor of the human being that's from 41,000 years ago.</v>

3382
01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.240
<v Speaker 1>They thought it might be a neanderthal.</v>

3383
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:54.910
<v Speaker 1>They thought it might be a homosapien.</v>

3384
01:42:55.090 --> 01:42:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out to be some new thing that they didn't even know existed.</v>

3385
01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.081
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>

3386
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:00.330
<v Speaker 1>they're calling it at Dennis.</v>

3387
01:43:00.331 --> 01:43:01.164
<v Speaker 1>So van,</v>

3388
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 1>based on where they found it,</v>

3389
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 1>and when we were talking about it before,</v>

3390
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:05.741
<v Speaker 1>we were all like,</v>

3391
01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:06.580
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

3392
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:07.431
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

3393
01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:08.180
<v Speaker 1>la.</v>

3394
01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>

3395
01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:13.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of learning something new and discovering something new that just</v>

3396
01:43:13.391 --> 01:43:14.224
<v Speaker 1>jazzes us</v>

3397
01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:15.240
<v Speaker 6>and that,</v>

3398
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.370
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the things that brought me to transhumanism,</v>

3399
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:17.790
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3400
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:20.250
<v Speaker 6>the desire to see the Milky Way.</v>

3401
01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3402
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.560
<v Speaker 6>learning that we didn't live,</v>

3403
01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:26.970
<v Speaker 6>we couldn't live long enough to explore the galaxy was just to me as a kid was</v>

3404
01:43:26.971 --> 01:43:28.020
<v Speaker 6>just really,</v>

3405
01:43:28.021 --> 01:43:28.231
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3406
01:43:28.231 --> 01:43:28.451
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

3407
01:43:28.451 --> 01:43:30.300
<v Speaker 6>it was like,</v>

3408
01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:30.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3409
01:43:30.601 --> 01:43:31.860
<v Speaker 6>you're a super geek.</v>

3410
01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 6>I grew up watching like star wars and,</v>

3411
01:43:35.201 --> 01:43:36.750
<v Speaker 6>and you're watching doctor who,</v>

3412
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.540
<v Speaker 6>and then finding out that were too fragile.</v>

3413
01:43:39.541 --> 01:43:41.400
<v Speaker 6>And we don't live long enough to see anything.</v>

3414
01:43:41.401 --> 01:43:43.020
<v Speaker 6>It's like we can't,</v>

3415
01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.300
<v Speaker 6>what we do is we say,</v>

3416
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:46.320
<v Speaker 6>what's over that hill?</v>

3417
01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:47.190
<v Speaker 6>What's over that mountain?</v>

3418
01:43:47.191 --> 01:43:48.024
<v Speaker 6>Let's go.</v>

3419
01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.080
<v Speaker 6>I know it's dangerous,</v>

3420
01:43:49.081 --> 01:43:49.681
<v Speaker 6>but hey,</v>

3421
01:43:49.681 --> 01:43:50.730
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing else to do.</v>

3422
01:43:50.731 --> 01:43:51.564
<v Speaker 6>Let's do it.</v>

3423
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 6>And the fact that we,</v>

3424
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 6>we can't cross space because we're just too much radiation or theirs,</v>

3425
01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 6>you'll develop wrong or whatever.</v>

3426
01:43:59.421 --> 01:43:59.991
<v Speaker 6>That to me,</v>

3427
01:43:59.991 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 6>that was devastating and unacceptable.</v>

3428
01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.193
<v Speaker 6>And I think that,</v>

3429
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3430
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:04.993
<v Speaker 6>that's just</v>

3431
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:09.380
<v Speaker 1>what other option is there but to move forward.</v>

3432
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:10.101
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny,</v>

3433
01:44:10.101 --> 01:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>that devastating.</v>

3434
01:44:11.271 --> 01:44:12.104
<v Speaker 1>Unacceptable.</v>

3435
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:12.441
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3436
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:13.221
<v Speaker 1>you heard about the,</v>

3437
01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3438
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a gentleman at the University of Connecticut that's the foremost</v>

3439
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:17.414
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

3440
01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:17.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3441
01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:19.610
<v Speaker 1>it working on time travel.</v>

3442
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Roy Mallet,</v>

3443
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I believe is Ray Mallet.</v>

3444
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

3445
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>

3446
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but he's a professor and he started his work on time trouble because his father</v>

3447
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 1>died when he was a young man and he wanted to go back in time to save his</v>

3448
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.010
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

3449
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.671
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

3450
01:44:34.671 --> 01:44:36.800
<v Speaker 1>he's like a goddamn character in a comic book.</v>

3451
01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:41.690
<v Speaker 1>He's like turn to a Spiderman book and he's been working on time travel to go</v>

3452
01:44:41.691 --> 01:44:43.880
<v Speaker 1>back in time and save his father</v>

3453
01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.753
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

3454
01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>

3455
01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:46.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's those,</v>

3456
01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.720
<v Speaker 1>those things like where you were like,</v>

3457
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that I'm living in a world where I won't get the fly in a</v>

3458
01:44:52.651 --> 01:44:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Battlestar Galactica ship and fight the cylons.</v>

3459
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 4>This is ridiculous.</v>

3460
01:44:57.081 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what's beautiful about transhumanism is that it has the impulse</v>

3461
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 4>within it is the same impulse.</v>

3462
01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.200
<v Speaker 4>They got people to go onto ships,</v>

3463
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 4>to sail towards a continent that they'd kind of heard about it.</v>

3464
01:45:10.581 --> 01:45:13.220
<v Speaker 4>The re risking everything with no food,</v>

3465
01:45:13.221 --> 01:45:14.180
<v Speaker 4>probably going to die.</v>

3466
01:45:14.181 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the earth just ends.</v>

3467
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something beautiful about what you guys are doing,</v>

3468
01:45:18.861 --> 01:45:23.450
<v Speaker 4>even though I do see it as a kind of self destructive act.</v>

3469
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I think when you put magnets on your fingers,</v>

3470
01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3471
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 4>you aren't thinking ahead,</v>

3472
01:45:27.441 --> 01:45:30.290
<v Speaker 4>you aren't thinking about what you're going to be like in 30 years.</v>

3473
01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:30.561
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3474
01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:31.101
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

3475
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:36.101
<v Speaker 4>You could be the dude who used to have a nose ring for like three days and I</v>

3476
01:45:36.591 --> 01:45:39.040
<v Speaker 4>didn't get a nose ring back did and almost killed you.</v>

3477
01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:40.130
<v Speaker 4>You self destructive,</v>

3478
01:45:40.131 --> 01:45:43.760
<v Speaker 4>best damn bull's they to give me the nose ring was not the same impulse that</v>

3479
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:46.220
<v Speaker 4>drove explorers through the sea.</v>

3480
01:45:46.221 --> 01:45:49.230
<v Speaker 4>It was just being dumb and high in Venice beach.</v>

3481
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.870
<v Speaker 4>There's no glory to it.</v>

3482
01:45:50.871 --> 01:45:52.550
<v Speaker 4>What these guys are doing is glorious.</v>

3483
01:45:52.551 --> 01:45:53.301
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool.</v>

3484
01:45:53.301 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just a kind of low.</v>

3485
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit,</v>

3486
01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.330
<v Speaker 4>you have to start somewhere.</v>

3487
01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3488
01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:57.830
<v Speaker 4>you gotta,</v>

3489
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:58.880
<v Speaker 4>you gotta start somewhere.</v>

3490
01:45:58.881 --> 01:46:00.430
<v Speaker 4>You're starting with magnets in your fingers.</v>

3491
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.881
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3492
01:46:00.881 --> 01:46:01.990
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's listening to this,</v>

3493

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3496
01:46:02.671 --> 01:46:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the scientist was Ronald Mallet,</v>

3497
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Ronald l mallet,</v>

3498

3501

<v Speaker 1>Would you like to meet Dimitri Itzkoff,</v>

3502

3514
01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe it doesn't even have to be a question and do it.</v>

3515
01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>

3516
01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:35.020
<v Speaker 1>would you have anything specific that you would want to talk to him about?</v>

3517
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:38.300
<v Speaker 6>I would actually ask him what his,</v>

3518
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:39.163
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3519
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 6>what his vision of the future is.</v>

3520
01:46:42.450 --> 01:46:42.871
<v Speaker 6>If it,</v>

3521
01:46:42.871 --> 01:46:45.270
<v Speaker 6>if it all pans out perfectly in his view,</v>

3522
01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.920
<v Speaker 6>what would it look like?</v>

3523
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 6>Cause I'm very interested in what his is.</v>

3524
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.521
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to,</v>

3525
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 5>I'd actually love to meet him.</v>

3526
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:52.450
<v Speaker 5>What about you?</v>

3527
01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:53.283
<v Speaker 5>Would you ask him?</v>

3528
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:55.711
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to meet him.</v>

3529
01:46:55.711 --> 01:47:00.711
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to know what he thinks about where we're going as,</v>

3530
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:02.791
<v Speaker 5>as a whole,</v>

3531
01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:06.240
<v Speaker 5>as a group of people who are experimenting with ourselves and,</v>

3532
01:47:06.241 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 5>and doing this stuff.</v>

3533
01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 5>And I would ask him for it,</v>

3534
01:47:10.471 --> 01:47:12.270
<v Speaker 5>the resources that we don't have.</v>

3535
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.860
<v Speaker 5>When you talk about how,</v>

3536
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:15.053
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3537
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:16.770
<v Speaker 5>putting a magnet inside yourself,</v>

3538
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:18.480
<v Speaker 5>you can't think about the long term.</v>

3539
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:18.781
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3540
01:47:18.781 --> 01:47:20.040
<v Speaker 5>it's not that we haven't,</v>

3541
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:23.910
<v Speaker 5>it's that the people we talked to who were professionals in these fields,</v>

3542
01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:29.240
<v Speaker 5>they can't risk telling us the answers because they have professional</v>

3543
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.550
<v Speaker 5>certification boards that would say,</v>

3544
01:47:32.551 --> 01:47:32.791
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3545
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 5>you're behaving unethically.</v>

3546
01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:37.380
<v Speaker 5>You're telling someone to do something harmful to themselves and they don't know</v>

3547
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:38.670
<v Speaker 5>the risks that we're taking.</v>

3548
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.170
<v Speaker 5>We're yanking your license.</v>

3549
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:43.860
<v Speaker 5>And so we don't get answers to questions that we need.</v>

3550
01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 5>And I think a guy like it's golf could probably put us in touch with a lot of</v>

3551
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 5>people would have a lot of answers for things I could really help us out.</v>

3552
01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

3553
01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3554
01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:54.311
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

3555
01:47:54.311 --> 01:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Really fun conversation.</v>

3556
01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.370
<v Speaker 1>A really interesting stuff.</v>

3557
01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic subject.</v>

3558
01:47:59.021 --> 01:47:59.854
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3559
01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.200
<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing what you're doing.</v>

3560
01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.250
