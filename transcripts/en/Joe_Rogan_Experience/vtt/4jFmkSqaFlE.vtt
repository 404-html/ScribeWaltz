00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>you gave it an eight.</v>

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I think garage bands pretty amazing too.</v>

4
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>the program where you can pretty much make your own song pretty easily.</v>

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have programs like that for your phone now?</v>

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

8
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

10
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.643
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

11
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

12
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we ever talked about it.</v>

13
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

14
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>back in the day in my space,</v>

15
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.354
<v Speaker 1>somebody linked,</v>

16
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>one of my songs on their myspace page and like stole it from my web host.</v>

18
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And so like when you went to their myspace page,</v>

19
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>it automatically played a song for myself.</v>

20
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

21
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>what I did is I took that file,</v>

22
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.971
<v Speaker 1>took it down,</v>

23
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and then made up a quick song and garage band about like,</v>

24
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.301
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

25
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Stacy from Hollywood,</v>

26
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.994
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

27
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I want you to suck my Dick and made a whole song just about how I wanted to fuck</v>

28
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>this girl and stuff like that.</v>

29
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And I replaced that song,</v>

30
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.853
<v Speaker 1>that file,</v>

31
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>what the original file so that when people went to her myspace page,</v>

32
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>it just started playing that song.</v>

33
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.921
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>

35
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that,</v>

36
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>why even thought about that,</v>

37
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty funny video.</v>

38
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when you think that with a hot linking and speaking of my space,</v>

39
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the yesterday what officially really just downsize.</v>

40
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>They shut off Germany,</v>

41
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>my space,</v>

42
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Germany is dead.</v>

43
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tweeted me,</v>

44
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>my space cut all their employees like three months ago.</v>

45
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Like half of their employees,</v>

46
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>they cut Jordan and they just did it again.</v>

47
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.481
<v Speaker 1>Jordy.</v>

48
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Jordy was rich and now you're lucky to,</v>

50
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you know he's worth comedy central but they use working memory.</v>

51
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:22.861
<v Speaker 1>We would come.</v>

52
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>My sweets comedy was thriving.</v>

53
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you did one of those secret shows.</v>

54
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I do want a secret shows.</v>

55
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about deleting my mind space live on the air.</v>

56
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you think do it if they're going to cut,</v>

57
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>show and ruin.</v>

58
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>it's funny how we did it with a,</v>

60
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

61
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I forget who we did it with,</v>

62
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>like Jason Tebow or something like that.</v>

63
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Somebody deleted their,</v>

64
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>my space the other day live on air a on the old one podcast.</v>

65
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

66
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't even come up with one original idea,</v>

67
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but watch how many steps it is.</v>

68
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.224
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hilarious.</v>

69
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It was Ari.</v>

70
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Ari did it and it was like three steps.</v>

71
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they make it really hard.</v>

72
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Like are you sure you</v>

73
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>still have people on it trying to talk to you?</v>

74
00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

75
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.271
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

76
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:00.751
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

77
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>

78
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of it is completely dead as well.</v>

79
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>You want to go into my mind that also will duel?</v>

80
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.001
<v Speaker 1>dual one.</v>

82

83
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you have glitter tags?</v>

85
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

86
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you would probably cause a failure.</v>

87
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

88
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.633
<v Speaker 1>I can even say it.</v>

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to delete your my space now too,</v>

90

<v Speaker 1>and we could have a double my space and I'm going to keep mine hide this</v>

91
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.313
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where to go.</v>

120
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.680
