00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

47
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>What was that really funny?</v>

48
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>A anti marijuana movie that they had back in the madness?</v>

49
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Reefer madness.</v>

50
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

51
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 2>we had to watch that in health class when I was in high school.</v>

52
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 2>There's part of the school curriculum back in the 60 [inaudible] so they showed</v>

54
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:38.901
<v Speaker 2>it to you,</v>

55
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>like is this real?</v>

56
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:41.151
<v Speaker 2>like it was real.</v>

58
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:41.931
<v Speaker 2>We all believe that.</v>

59
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 2>So remember I was from little,</v>

60
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.201
<v Speaker 2>Carlisle,</v>

62
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:45.801
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>

63
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 2>got some of me that's like a hick town.</v>

65
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

66
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I just recently saw reason,</v>

67
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>just about maybe six months ago.</v>

69
00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.691
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

70
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:00.524
<v Speaker 2>What started it off?</v>

71
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

72
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I just had so many friends who were into it.</v>

73
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because I made observations.</v>

74
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

75
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I've been in Brazilian Jujitsu now for,</v>

76
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.341
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

77
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:11.031
<v Speaker 2>since 89.</v>

78
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:11.781
<v Speaker 2>How many years is that?</v>

79
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:12.614
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

80
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

81
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>20 something.</v>

82
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

83
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Probably 6.6.</v>

85
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh my.</v>

86
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

87
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:23.421
<v Speaker 2>most every BJJ champ that I know was totally into marijuana.</v>

88
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 2>They give it to use it to relax because it's such an intense sport,</v>

89
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

90
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

91
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.471
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

92
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>it's such an extremist thing.</v>

93
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

94
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.011
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

95
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 2>You go out and try to hurt someone as much as possible,</v>

96
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 2>but joint locks and so forth,</v>

97
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and what were you choke him to sleep.</v>

98
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

99
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Of course that being said,</v>

100
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I had way more injuries with the college wrestling that I ever did with,</v>

101
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.731
<v Speaker 2>with Jujitsu,</v>

102
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 2>cause he can always tap.</v>

103
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

104
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 2>But I just noticed that these guys,</v>

105
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:46.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 2>it's an intense sport,</v>

107
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe not as intense as MMA,</v>

108
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly up there and they all would light up at night and so forth</v>

109
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.701
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

110
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>that has her bongs or,</v>

111
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 2>roll up a joint.</v>

113
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.391
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

114
00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I could just never</v>

115
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.851
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>

116
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It just would blow my mind.</v>

117
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

118
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>And over time I just got more and more curious.</v>

119
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

120
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

122
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of friends in Australia that were really totally into this also.</v>

123
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.173
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

124
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.501
<v Speaker 1>I just decided,</v>

125
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

126
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm missing something here.</v>

127
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm in my sixties,</v>

129
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I missed the sixties so I made my sixties so I'm going to check this out.</v>

131
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So I started playing around.</v>

132
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.451
<v Speaker 1>I've got one of those.</v>

133
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>what I didn't like was the smoke,</v>

135
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I find it really irritating,</v>

136
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but I tried one of those,</v>

137
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the cost to the vape,</v>

138
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little square box with a little straw books.</v>

139
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

140
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>we take a little kid's juice box,</v>

141
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Adult juice sparks,</v>

143
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of those now have pens that like,</v>

144
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>they look like a,</v>

145
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a metal cylinder with like a lip on the end of it.</v>

146
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.813
<v Speaker 1>And you and you,</v>

147
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you pack it with either oil that you can buy pre prefilled little tubes of,</v>

148
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>of hemp oil or THC oil and stick it in there and it has some sort of an element</v>

149
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>in there and it heats it up and you're just breathing.</v>

150
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And vapors is a vaporizer,</v>

151
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>a portable vaporizer.</v>

152
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

153
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I was just very curious and um,</v>

154
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.461
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>

155
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:12.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

156
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I you,</v>

157
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you've been into this for a long time.</v>

158
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Very open about it and I thought,</v>

159
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:16.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you are really into your health and your body and you take great care of</v>

161
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.114
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

162
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and I figured,</v>

163
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>if it's really all that harmful,</v>

165
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Joe wouldn't be doing this.</v>

166
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that you would do something like that.</v>

167
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

168
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.711
<v Speaker 1>I was with you.</v>

169
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean before I started smoking pot,</v>

170
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I was in the same boat.</v>

171
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I really thought it was for idiots.</v>

172
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was for people that just wanted to escape reality.</v>

173
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.294
<v Speaker 1>There were weak,</v>

174
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't handle it.</v>

175
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted to get drugged out.</v>

176
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it the same way I think about pain pills today.</v>

177
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.831
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

178
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

179
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.093
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>

180
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I've had three knee surgeries.</v>

181
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>My first major one,</v>

182
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>my first ACL was a Patella tendon graft,</v>

183
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:55.931
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of,</v>

184
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it was particularly painful because they slice your patella tendon,</v>

185
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>they cut a chunk out of your knee cap and a chunk out of your Shin Bone and then</v>

186
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>they drill it all in place and screw it in place.</v>

187
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It's good because it's a native piece of tendon.</v>

188
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:09.861
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

189
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:10.071
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

190
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

191
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

192
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>it hears the body very quickly and there's very little chance of rejection and</v>

193
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strong,</v>

194
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.231
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

195
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's very painful and they gave me a prescription for Vicodin or some shit.</v>

196
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.731
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>

197
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:26.731
<v Speaker 1>one of them won and I remember sitting on the couch feeling so stupid and foggy</v>

198
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.451
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

199
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I am done with this.</v>

200
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>My other two surgeries,</v>

201
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

202
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>my other ACL and my other meniscus surgery,</v>

203
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:35.824
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take anything.</v>

204
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.461
<v Speaker 1>My knee,</v>

205
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>my a nose.</v>

206
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>When I had my nose fixed,</v>

207
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I had my deviated septum fixed and my turbinates cutout,</v>

208
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>my no stretched out and they put tubes in and everything.</v>

209
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

210
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take anything,</v>

211
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.703
<v Speaker 1>just pot.</v>

212
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

213
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

214
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

215
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't like anything that leaves me like cloudy and that seems like that's what</v>

216
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I thought pot was.</v>

217
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought pot was something that left you stupid or cloudy</v>

218
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's really just,</v>

219
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>

220
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.020
<v Speaker 2>It tunes you in.</v>

221
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.913
<v Speaker 2>I was shocked.</v>

222
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I was utterly shocked.</v>

223
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.510
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I noticed was my vision improved.</v>

224
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been near side and most of my life.</v>

225
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

226
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I basically found my eyes were getting worse each year,</v>

227
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.910
<v Speaker 2>getting stronger prescriptions.</v>

228
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I finally read this book,</v>

229
00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 2>take off your glasses and see.</v>

230
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

231
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I just basically threw my glasses in the trash and started doing ice</v>

232
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.060
<v Speaker 2>strengthening exercises.</v>

233
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Kind of neat.</v>

234
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going through that right now myself.</v>

235
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.390
<v Speaker 2>They improved a lot.</v>

236
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different exercises you can do,</v>

237
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.264
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

238
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

239
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 2>the name of the book is take off your glasses and say,</v>

240
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.930
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

241
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was a disciple of the Bates method of,</v>

242
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 2>I strengthening,</v>

244
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>but when I was at the summit of the breath masters in Moscow,</v>

245
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 2>they had a bunch of guys there that,</v>

246
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:48.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.270
<v Speaker 2>we're using a breathing and I exercise and all sorts of stuff for the</v>

248
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 2>improvement of vision.</v>

249
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 2>One was a former,</v>

250
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Spetsnaz snipers,</v>

252
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.630
<v Speaker 2>so I guess he knows a thing or two about vision training.</v>

253
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>And he was showing some of the August just has a seizure.</v>

254
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:01.571
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

255
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:01.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:02.564
<v Speaker 2>a real simple stuff.</v>

257
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

258
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:04.511
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

259
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:05.380
<v Speaker 2>this works.</v>

260
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But only to a point.</v>

261
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 2>It got really good to the point where I can drive during the day.</v>

262
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I still a little reluctant to drive at night.</v>

263
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

264
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.553
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

265
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 2>but I can't read street signs at night.</v>

266
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.341
<v Speaker 2>During the day.</v>

267
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I can actually see signs,</v>

268
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

269
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a little reluctant and the,</v>

270
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

271
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.740
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed with the,</v>

272
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:28.300
<v Speaker 2>when I would take the THC,</v>

273
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I was using one of those vaporizer things.</v>

274
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.710
<v Speaker 2>It was like my eyes would start to really clear,</v>

275
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.940
<v Speaker 2>which leads me to believe that it has something to do with muscular tension.</v>

276
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that my digestion would improved and instead of getting foggy,</v>

277
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.460
<v Speaker 2>like I would be on my iPad,</v>

278
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe doing an email or something,</v>

279
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like somehow my fingers would just glide over the keys and just magically</v>

280
00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>find the letters way faster.</v>

281
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Or at least my perception of how much faster.</v>

282
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.041
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

283
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 2>It was just a very interesting experience.</v>

284
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

285
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that people use it for with Jujitsu is not just to relax after</v>

286
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:04.041
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

287
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but before training because it focuses you in a very tunnel vision sort of a</v>

288
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

289
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>When a eye roll,</v>

290
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>when I smoked pot and role,</v>

291
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm better at Jujitsu.</v>

292
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.601
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

293
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I feel like more relaxed I feel,</v>

294
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>and not just more relaxed.</v>

295
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm more sensitive.</v>

296
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm like more in tune with what's going on.</v>

297
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

298
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I love stretching on it.</v>

299
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite things to do.</v>

300
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I love eating one of those things.</v>

301
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Those jumbos I just gave you that say,</v>

302
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

303
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried eating it.</v>

304
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>That's an all organic edible,</v>

305
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>a THC,</v>

306
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

308
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>little cake thing.</v>

309
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's all with natural honey and all natural ingredients.</v>

310
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like probably the healthiest of all these edible ones cause a lot of these</v>

311
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>edible ones are using processed sugars and high fructose corn syrup and stuff.</v>

312
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>

313
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So this guy who created these,</v>

314
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>he decided,</v>

315
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be an market for an organic of these marijuana edibles.</v>

317
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's much healthier for your body,</v>

318
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's a really strong,</v>

319
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>be careful now going to be very careful.</v>

320
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

321
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

322
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I have not,</v>

324
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>in truth taking it before I've trained,</v>

326
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but I read about the guy in Colorado,</v>

327
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the triathlete,</v>

328
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>he's world class athlete,</v>

329
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.230
<v Speaker 1>very elite and he,</v>

331
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>he's been really advocating taking it before endurance training.</v>

332
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it improves a pain threshold.</v>

333
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.741
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

334
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>your tolerance to physical exercise,</v>

335
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:24.541
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

336
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>not pain,</v>

337
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

338
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>But like exercise and do discomfort.</v>

340
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way your body reacts.</v>

341
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way your body reacts and any sort of when I work out with it.</v>

342
00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>But if I lift weights with it,</v>

343
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.371
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

344
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I can feel the fibers or at least I feel like I'm feeling,</v>

345
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel the fibers of my muscles.</v>

346
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I feel I'm very sensitive to it,</v>

347
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why I really enjoyed doing it before I stretch.</v>

348
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And Terence Mckenna,</v>

349
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>who is a late,</v>

350
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>great psychedelic philosopher,</v>

351
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

352
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.320
<v Speaker 1>it was his contention that yoga itself was really a how to use cannabis manual</v>

353
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and that the way to optimize your experience with cannabis was through yoga.</v>

354
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause all of those saw dues.</v>

355
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 1>All those guys are just a hash smoking freaks.</v>

356
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>They're all like one that's like the dark secret of the sod dues he would say is</v>

357
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>what they really concentrate on is how many chillums can you smoke before you</v>

358
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:18.564
<v Speaker 1>pass out?</v>

359
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.051
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

360
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:19.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not a man unless you can go deep,</v>

362
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:21.271
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

363
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>deep into the rabbit hole.</v>

364
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And these guys would smoke massive amounts of Hash and do yoga.</v>

365
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

366
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

368
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.281
<v Speaker 1>I used to think,</v>

369
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:30.541
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>

370
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of crazy.</v>

371
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess they're just having fun and doing it until the one time I did yoga</v>

372
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>when I was high and I was like,</v>

373
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:38.694
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

374
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

375
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can relax more and get deeper into poses.</v>

376
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And also I feel like I feel this,</v>

377
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>the resistance,</v>

378
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.643
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of,</v>

379
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Pavel,</v>

381
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

382
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>talks about this as well.</v>

383
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say his last name.</v>

384
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:54.891
<v Speaker 1>How do you say his last,</v>

385
00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:59.891
<v Speaker 1>that sewing sat soling who's a one of the most famous advocates of the Kettle</v>

386
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Bell,</v>

387
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.441
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

388
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>talked about stretching being a big part of what holds you back is a tension,</v>

390
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>psychological tension,</v>

391
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily even flexibility,</v>

392
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but that you're worried about your brain sets up that stretch reflex.</v>

393
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

394
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 1>When you're in an unfamiliar position.</v>

395
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:16.291
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

396
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:16.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it's saying danger.</v>

398
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You're in a different position than you're used to being in.</v>

399
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 1>For most of us that's sitting in chairs or most most people,</v>

400
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

401
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the most,</v>

403
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

404
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the most common position.</v>

405
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

406
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And when your head's in between your legs and you're stretching your hamstrings</v>

407
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:33.661
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

408
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:33.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

410
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>your body is threatened by that.</v>

411
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>But was like,</v>

412
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing there buddy?</v>

413
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Tents it up,</v>

414
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.993
<v Speaker 1>tents it out.</v>

415
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

416
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying was that it's all about like breathing,</v>

417
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.680
<v Speaker 1>like resist and then relax.</v>

418
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.793
<v Speaker 1>Resist.</v>

419
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.143
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>

420
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.180
<v Speaker 1>but that resist and relax is enhanced.</v>

421
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many fold when you're on marijuana.</v>

422
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

423
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how deep you go into stretches and how good it feels afterwards.</v>

424
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Is this weird state your reach when you do yoga or any type of deep stretching</v>

425
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:05.861
<v Speaker 1>on marijuana?</v>

426
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge,</v>

427
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>huge fan of that.</v>

428
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Well that's it.</v>

429
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a neophyte man.</v>

430
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

431
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>teach me master.</v>

432
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

433
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

434
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing and never let it be said to Steve Maxwell doesn't</v>

435
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.061
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

436
00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

437
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

438
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I really think that one of the secrets to aging well is to be open minded and</v>

439
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>just to experiment and learn new things.</v>

440
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Try New things.</v>

441
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And Jill,</v>

442
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>be such a stick in the mud with,</v>

443
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>with your belief systems,</v>

444
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:32.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.240
<v Speaker 1>don't get so holier than thou with all,</v>

446
00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:37.130
<v Speaker 1>all your beliefs because hey man,</v>

447
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 1>have you think about it?</v>

449
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of really high spiritual adepts,</v>

450
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>they all use some type of either,</v>

451
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:49.111
<v Speaker 1>a hallucinogen or when we talked to last time and the show about Iowasca and so</v>

453
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.780
<v Speaker 1>forth and you know,</v>

454
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>the shape and the shamans use and they're raw mushrooms.</v>

455
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think as you get older,</v>

456
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I think especially when you have been around a lot of fools,</v>

457
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you reach a certain point in your life where you don't want to tolerate any</v>

458
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.410
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and you're just like God,</v>

459
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.420
<v Speaker 1>enough of this nonsense like what you need is you know,</v>

460
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>a nice,</v>

461
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.010
<v Speaker 1>a good diet.</v>

462
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't need any supplements.</v>

463
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need any hooey and your life.</v>

464
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't need any BS.</v>

465
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Just get out of bed and go out and do it.</v>

466
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

467
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>that sort of mentality serves you well.</v>

468
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>But in having that mentality and meeting all these fools,</v>

469
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.030
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can kind of develop prejudices.</v>

470
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 1>You develop these ideas that aren't necessarily based on data.</v>

471
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's more based on like sort of just your perceptions of the people that are</v>

472
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

473
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see enough losers that do something,</v>

474
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:39.051
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

475
00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>well that's for losers.</v>

476
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>He see enough losers that are smoking pot.</v>

477
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:43.151
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

478
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:43.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

479
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 1>pawn is for losers is obvious.</v>

480
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Like look at all these losers spoken pot and then you meet like Bj Penn.</v>

481
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:48.881
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

482
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:49.081
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

483
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:49.181
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

484
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:49.481
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

485
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:50.011
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn,</v>

486
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>good high and does Jujitsu.</v>

487
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>

488
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.051
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

489
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:53.361
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

490
00:13:53.361 --> 00:13:53.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:53.941
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

492
00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:54.121
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

493
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you find out that 90% of the Brazilian Jujitsu champions are smoking pot and</v>

494
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>rolling this stuff.</v>

495
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's an,</v>

497
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a performance enhancer.</v>

498
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 1>There was actually an article recently about ultra marathoners.</v>

499
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.071
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

500
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:06.821
<v Speaker 1>see if he can pull that up.</v>

501
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:07.211
<v Speaker 1>Cause it was,</v>

502
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I forget what publication it was in,</v>

503
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.670
<v Speaker 1>but it was a big article where people were really being really shocked at these</v>

504
00:14:15.351 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>are the results and these guys that were ultra marathoners that we're advocating</v>

505
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 1>smoking marijuana.</v>

506
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about should this be banned from ultra marathon?</v>

507
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll outside magazine also a thing could have been outside of there as soon</v>

508
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.160
<v Speaker 1>as that Fox was right here and there were a bunch of different things.</v>

509
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

510
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>marijuana has benefits,</v>

511
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but is it ethical?</v>

512
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:34.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.074
<v Speaker 1>See this is the thing.</v>

514
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Well people of course it's ethical.</v>

515
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Is Our vitamins ethical?</v>

516
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Is Fruit ethical?</v>

517
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Is Caffeine ethical?</v>

518
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a God damn plant.</v>

519
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people are all on caffeine.</v>

520
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

521
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's the dirty secret about marathon runners ultra.</v>

522
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy who is my friend,</v>

523
00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Cameron Hanes is a fanatical runner.</v>

524
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>He 10 miles a day,</v>

525
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes 15.</v>

526
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>He does marathons,</v>

527
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>he's done an ultra marathon.</v>

528
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gearing up for another ultra marathon.</v>

529
00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a maniac and he's always hopped up on the caffeine always.</v>

530
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But he has a job,</v>

531
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 1>like a regular job and he can't touch the pot.</v>

532
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And I've been telling them about all this and he's like,</v>

533
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:09.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was another good reason why I should quit my job.</v>

534
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

536
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.371
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

537
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.204
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

538
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>there's another very interesting thing I've been experimenting with,</v>

539
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>but for years,</v>

540
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.071
<v Speaker 2>and that's the,</v>

541
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

542
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>the state of brainwave meditation where you actually,</v>

543
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 2>your brain produces different levels of brainwaves.</v>

544
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Your brain oscillates at certain speeds and different parts of the brain produce</v>

545
00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:31.920
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

546
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 2>like Alpha,</v>

548
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Beta,</v>

549
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.633
<v Speaker 2>gamma,</v>

550
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.151
<v Speaker 2>Delta,</v>

551
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 2>theta.</v>

552
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.860
<v Speaker 2>But they just like the one that's most closely associated with that sort of</v>

553
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 2>between sleep and wakefulness.</v>

554
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 2>When the subconscious mind can be programmed.</v>

555
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.171
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

556
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:45.261
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

557
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really good programs out there.</v>

558
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 2>It produces a beat and then your brain starts to adapt and copied the beat.</v>

559
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 2>And you can slow the brainwave dam.</v>

560
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 2>It's what I did in the plane.</v>

561
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

562
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.041
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

563
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:03.041
<v Speaker 2>I flew in from Sydney like 14 hour flight man and didn't really get that much</v>

564
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

565
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.900
<v Speaker 2>but I did one of those [inaudible] beats theta brainwave meditation.</v>

566
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Now this you're wearing headphones?</v>

567
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

568
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

569
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

570
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I actually was using a Bose earbuds,</v>

571
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.480
<v Speaker 2>noise cancellations and just sitting there with my iPhone and just wow.</v>

572
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Zoning.</v>

573
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

574
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.850
<v Speaker 2>when you come out of it,</v>

575
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you just had a refreshing sleep.</v>

576
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.451
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

577
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:26.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

578
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

579
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 2>very relaxing.</v>

580
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of relaxation.</v>

581
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.270
<v Speaker 2>And so for those folks that are still a little leery about maybe trying</v>

582
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 2>something like THC,</v>

583
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>you can do this with the theta brainwave meditation.</v>

584
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>All of the brainwaves like have their benefits.</v>

585
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.050
<v Speaker 2>The alphas,</v>

586
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 2>like what we're in right now,</v>

587
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha and the,</v>

588
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:46.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

589
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.103
<v Speaker 2>the Beta,</v>

590
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 2>like while we're awake.</v>

591
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 2>GAM is like when you're in a real deep sleep,</v>

592
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 2>like real deep dream,</v>

593
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 2>like state,</v>

594
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 2>the theaters like that twilight,</v>

595
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:55.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 2>when you're the,</v>

597
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 2>this is when,</v>

598
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 2>when people meditate,</v>

599
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 2>they go into a theta brainwave state.</v>

600
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 2>But by listening,</v>

601
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 2>you could meditate like a monk your first time out man.</v>

602
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

603
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require any special breathing or postures or anything.</v>

605
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 2>You could just literally sit or lie down comfortably and he's just going into</v>

606
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:18.824
<v Speaker 2>the zone.</v>

607
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 2>And if you do practice visualization or if you practice any kind of affirmations</v>

608
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>or subconscious mind programming,</v>

609
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a great time to do it,</v>

610
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

611
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So you're listening to a program,</v>

612
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 2>what is the name of the program and how do you get,</v>

613
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of different ones.</v>

614
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:33.980

615
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>you can go to Amazon or iTunes and just look for a theta brainwave meditation.</v>

616
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.741
<v Speaker 2>I'd recommend,</v>

617
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe people just go on,</v>

618

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many different companies out there now.</v>

622
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.120

00:17:52.391 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 3>An Rj,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have it on my iPhone.</v>

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

631
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't programs and it's really handy for,</v>

632
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 3>for guys like us cause you do your fair share of travel when you have to adapt</v>

633
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 3>to a new time zone.</v>

634
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's pretty hard to sleep in some of these points?</v>

635
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes do.</v>

636
00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:07.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

637
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to sleep on planes.</v>

638
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.254
<v Speaker 3>It's also hard for,</v>

639
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

640
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:10.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

641
00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:11.041
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

642
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 3>if I'm tired I can conk out pretty much far down on the floor it goes.</v>

643
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:15.391
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

644
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

645
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me when I have to do something like three hours and I know well I</v>

646
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 3>can take a nap right now for two hours.</v>

647
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.943
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

648
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Almost makes you feel worse than if he didn't take it at all,</v>

649
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.530
<v Speaker 3>which I lie there and I go,</v>

650
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I go to sleep,</v>

651
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:29.821
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

652
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I usually can't get there.</v>

653
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 3>But you slept the earphones on,</v>

654
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:33.350
<v Speaker 3>but your,</v>

655
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.760
<v Speaker 3>your binary or beat,</v>

656
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:35.660
<v Speaker 3>that's just like a one,</v>

657
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the programs.</v>

658
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 3>What does it sound like?</v>

659
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

660
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 3>well sometimes they use music.</v>

661
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 3>You can hear like an underlying beat.</v>

662
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just underneath the conscious hearing and,</v>

663
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.013
<v Speaker 3>but you can,</v>

664
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of hear like a little rhythm going on and sometimes they'll have</v>

665
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful kind of angelic,</v>

666
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

667
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:52.494
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

668
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

669
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they just have like sounds of the ocean,</v>

670
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:55.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 3>like ocean waves,</v>

672
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 3>incredibly relaxing.</v>

673
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 3>And you just find yourself zoning and when you finish the program,</v>

674
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.300
<v Speaker 3>you really do feel like you had just a very nice refreshing sleep and you feel</v>

675
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:09.804
<v Speaker 3>quite,</v>

676
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.883
<v Speaker 3>quite excellent.</v>

677
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.890
<v Speaker 3>So they vary in the sounds,</v>

678
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.140
<v Speaker 3>but the beat stimulates the same part of the brain.</v>

679
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of different techniques.</v>

680
00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:19.740
<v Speaker 3>So one,</v>

681
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 3>what are the techniques?</v>

683
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 3>They have a different rhythm going in each year.</v>

684
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

685
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 3>So the right and left hemispheres have to synchronize with each other.</v>

686
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 3>What if you're bipolar?</v>

687
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

688
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

689
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.783
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

690
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 3>You know that I,</v>

691
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort you out.</v>

692
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.431
<v Speaker 3>Mean I'm not a,</v>

693
00:19:37.431 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a brain scientist,</v>

694
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:41.520
<v Speaker 3>but I have been doing this for a bunch of years with good results,</v>

695
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if maybe if you have a mental illness or bipolar sent them,</v>

696
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 3>but they do claim that it regulates your hormonal levels.</v>

697
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.891
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

698
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

699
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 3>And there's even,</v>

700
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

701
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.180
<v Speaker 3>even to the point of producing growth hormone and so forth,</v>

702
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 3>have you ever messed around with any of those?</v>

703
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

704
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:01.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

705
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 3>do you know the turbo sonic is,</v>

706
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 3>it uses sound waves through the base of a platform.</v>

707
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 3>You stand on this and it,</v>

708
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 3>and it takes you through a bunch of different cycles I have and its sound,</v>

709
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 3>but you don't hear it.</v>

710
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:12.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>

711
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you're standing on a stage just getting fucked,</v>

712
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:15.511
<v Speaker 3>shaking,</v>

713
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:16.310
<v Speaker 3>just getting vibed.</v>

714
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 3>You'll have loved that thing.</v>

715
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I have one of those things in my house and it's supposed to like do all sorts of</v>

716
00:20:20.911 --> 00:20:25.911
<v Speaker 3>things as far as stimulate the production of various hormones and you know,</v>

717
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.121
<v Speaker 3>an aid,</v>

718
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 3>healing and circulation.</v>

719
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.900
<v Speaker 3>But it makes you feel great,</v>

720
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.920
<v Speaker 3>but there's not ways you can just exercise and,</v>

721
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

722
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 3>and do vibrations and so forth.</v>

723
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:36.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

724
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 3>and trampolines are really good for that,</v>

725
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

726
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:37.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

727
00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

728
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Dallas Yogis and the she Kong,</v>

729
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.910

730
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

731
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 3>practitioners have been doing similar things with their own bodies.</v>

732
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously the platform makes it much more convenient.</v>

733
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:49.631
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

734
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:50.441
<v Speaker 3>it's 10 minutes.</v>

735
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 3>You get on that sucker for 10 minutes and you're like,</v>

736
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 3>hey [inaudible] he goes through all these different,</v>

737
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 3>like you'll do like 10 seconds at one and then 10 seconds at another and then</v>

738
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:03.371
<v Speaker 3>very fast,</v>

739
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 3>high frequency and then low and slow shaking.</v>

740
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:06.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

741
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:07.940
<v Speaker 3>or no,</v>

742
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.200
<v Speaker 3>and when it's all reelect,</v>

743
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:09.611
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

744
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I feel so fantastic.</v>

745
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:11.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

746
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 3>it's wild that a felted craze,</v>

747
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.141
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

748
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:14.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 3>they have like a,</v>

750
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 3>a bouncing,</v>

751
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 3>shaking vibrational kind of thing.</v>

752
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.070
<v Speaker 3>And there's a,</v>

753
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

754
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.371
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

755
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 3>the Dow Yoga just have a thing where they do this kind of stuff.</v>

756
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.793
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

757
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Russia,</v>

758
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

759
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.660
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

760
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.660
<v Speaker 3>they had as part of their raw Slavic Russian Russian health system.</v>

761
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 3>If their mobility stuff,</v>

762
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.710
<v Speaker 3>they would have shaking and vibrations and,</v>

763
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 3>and all of the stuff that you just kind of do it yourself.</v>

764
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 3>And I read this guy I'm Alexandra at and he was a,</v>

765
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 3>like a psychiatrist that treated people with,</v>

766
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

767
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.331
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

768
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

769
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 3>chronic mental problems with the exercise and so forth.</v>

770
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>And really he was really big into shaking and moving the body and all these</v>

771
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 3>interesting patterns and it's very relaxing,</v>

772
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 3>just gets a lot of the tension out.</v>

773
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.131
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with you.</v>

774
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

775
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.533
<v Speaker 3>I do believe it,</v>

776
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 3>it does help facilitate a recovery.</v>

777
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 3>I think mental problems and relaxation are so often not connected with each</v>

778
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:10.120
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

779
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Mental problems and exercise and exertion.</v>

780
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that a lot of people,</v>

781
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.760
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the tension comes from a not releasing energy and their body stores up</v>

782
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 3>this energy like a battery and then it's leaking all over the place that it's</v>

783
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 3>just like there's short circuiting when you see people screaming and traffic and</v>

784
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:29.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

785
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 3>and cutting people off and right.</v>

786
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 3>All this madness that,</v>

787
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really is like a form of madness when you see someone screaming at</v>

788
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 3>someone that's not even anywhere near them and traffic,</v>

789
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 3>the stress levels just get so much.</v>

790
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:43.990
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that goes also back when we talked about this last time too about</v>

791
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 3>your breathing patterns.</v>

792
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Most people and I do seminars all over the world and we test ourselves to see</v>

793
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 3>what type of breather we are.</v>

794
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

795
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things we do first and amongst everybody in the seminar is like</v>

796
00:22:56.561 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 3>a Co vicular breathe that they're using the emergency apparatus of the upper</v>

797
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:00.964
<v Speaker 3>neck and chest,</v>

798
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 3>shallow breathing,</v>

799
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>breathing,</v>

800
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 3>and it's panic braiding.</v>

801
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 3>And all those emergency receptors are in the upper lobes of the lungs and</v>

802
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 3>they're not bringing the Otu down into the lower lobes.</v>

803
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 3>So they're in a chronic panic,</v>

804
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.310
<v Speaker 3>they're in a heightened state of village.</v>

805
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 3>It's all the time.</v>

806
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 3>That's exhausting man.</v>

807
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 3>And it does all sorts of weird things to your hormones and it definitely,</v>

808
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to be in a good mood and relaxed when you're in this panic state.</v>

809
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Your subconscious mind doesn't know that.</v>

810
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>There's not like a threat looming over the horizon.</v>

811
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 3>So everything that happens is perceived as a threat.</v>

812
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Every little comment,</v>

813
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>someone cuts you off in traffic.</v>

815
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 3>People take it so personally cause it's,</v>

816
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a threat because they're all caught up in the chest.</v>

817
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:46.911
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

818
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:47.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

819
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 2>when you learn to do proper diaphragmatic breathing and bringing the breath down</v>

820
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 2>to the lower lobes of the lungs,</v>

821
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly calming.</v>

822
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

823
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.833
<v Speaker 2>you can do that with.</v>

824
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:57.931
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

825
00:23:57.931 --> 00:24:01.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you recommend if someone is looking into doing something like that?</v>

826
00:24:01.651 --> 00:24:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Is there a book that you recommend or a program do you have?</v>

827
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

828
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.663
<v Speaker 2>one of your seminars.</v>

829
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.360
<v Speaker 2>A lot of breath work,</v>

830
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:08.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 2>well master Hixon Gracie now,</v>

832
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:11.620
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

834
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean for years he never showed us his breathing system.</v>

835
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

836
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.610
<v Speaker 2>he'd be kicking our ass and doing this kind of weird breathing.</v>

837
00:24:18.611 --> 00:24:21.310
<v Speaker 2>And I used to think as he making fun of me,</v>

838
00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:21.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

839
00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:23.860
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what this weird kind of thing he was doing.</v>

840
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

841
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.793
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

842
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 2>All hoists,</v>

843
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Hoy,</v>

844
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.800
<v Speaker 2>they all knew how to do this and they weren't teaching us blue and purple belts</v>

846
00:24:32.801 --> 00:24:35.950
<v Speaker 2>at the time but now he's spending a lot of time teaching.</v>

847
00:24:35.951 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I heard that crown also is spending a lot of time cause I think it's really,</v>

848
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:42.250
<v Speaker 2>really important for combat athletes to,</v>

849
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

850
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.290
<v Speaker 2>learn to read the acts and the way you relax in combat is through breath</v>

851
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.273
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>

852
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.160
<v Speaker 2>But as far as actually being taught,</v>

853
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it that the systemic guys do a pretty good job with it,</v>

854
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:56.523
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

855
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:56.951
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

856
00:24:56.951 --> 00:24:57.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

857
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.150
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because,</v>

858
00:24:58.151 --> 00:24:58.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:24:58.391 --> 00:25:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I started really getting into this reading a lot.</v>

860
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

861
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't reading stuff related to combat as much as mostly yoga stuff.</v>

862
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

863
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.043
<v Speaker 2>where she come.</v>

864
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:08.981
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

865
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:09.814
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

866
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:10.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

867
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:12.190
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda hard to find the information.</v>

868
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

869
00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:13.540
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

870
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find information.</v>

871
00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:18.060
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know like what's the best program for you?</v>

872
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to try a few different ones,</v>

873
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 1>what you enjoy or what,</v>

874
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.640
<v Speaker 1>what seems to benefit you.</v>

875
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.361
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

876
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:24.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

877
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.381
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

878
00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:29.040
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with martial arts and you're dealing with,</v>

879
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:29.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

880
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.200
<v Speaker 1>training and,</v>

881
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:31.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

882
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.730
<v Speaker 1>especially competing,</v>

883
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.590
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with extremely stressful situations where your body's pushed at a</v>

884
00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:39.000
<v Speaker 1>very high pace where,</v>

885
00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:39.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:25:39.361 --> 00:25:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you reached the point of exhaustion and then you have to continue for,</v>

887
00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:43.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

888
00:25:43.051 --> 00:25:43.321
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

889
00:25:43.321 --> 00:25:44.730
<v Speaker 1>four minutes while you're exhausted.</v>

890
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's ever rolled has experienced that.</v>

891
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:47.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
00:25:47.461 --> 00:25:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you're doing maybe a seven or nine minute role,</v>

893
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.311
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

894
00:25:50.311 --> 00:25:50.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

895
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.001
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

896
00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:51.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

897
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.090
<v Speaker 1>grappling sparring for the uninitiated.</v>

898
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times a year,</v>

899
00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:56.010
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

900
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.843
<v Speaker 1>three minutes in,</v>

901
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.700
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're rolling with someone good and you are exhausted,</v>

902
00:25:59.701 --> 00:26:02.940
<v Speaker 1>totally exhausted and you got to figure out a way to get to a clinch and just,</v>

903
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:06.950
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

904
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 4>let's</v>

905
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.160
<v Speaker 1>try to bring your heart rate down and try to do just enough to defend and keep</v>

906
00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:13.114
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

907
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but not enough to totally tax out your muscles.</v>

908
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And also don't let your mind get into that panic state.</v>

909
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Like the breath is what controls that because if he can't breathe,</v>

910
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna Flake.</v>

911
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:26:25.421 --> 00:26:26.081
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

913
00:26:26.081 --> 00:26:26.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

914
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.930
<v Speaker 1>training with a guy who was like a real athletic guy,</v>

915
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 1>very strong guy,</v>

916
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't done Jujitsu before and so he was really excited to learn it and</v>

917
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:39.160
<v Speaker 1>just try to get into Jujitsu and you know,</v>

918
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 1>he's in their sparring and he asked me to spar and I'm like,</v>

919
00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

920
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

921
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:43.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

922
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

923
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 1>how long have you doing it now?</v>

924
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:45.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

925
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:45.490
<v Speaker 1>AH,</v>

926
00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>a couple of months and this now.</v>

927
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just getting into it.</v>

928
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm just starting to spar.</v>

929
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:49.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

930
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

931
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

932
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:50.761
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

933
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

934
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 1>so we started,</v>

935
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember I got to position,</v>

936
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I like mounted him and I could feel him just full panic.</v>

937
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 1>His body locked up.</v>

938
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I'd never felt,</v>

939
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not usually rolling with someone who's that inexperience,</v>

940
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>so to do like a raw white belts,</v>

941
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>only been doing it for a short period of time.</v>

942
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>He really didn't know what to do and he was just locked up and I'm like,</v>

943
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>just calm down.</v>

944
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Just breathe very,</v>

945
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

946
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to help you.</v>

947
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Like this is definitely going to hurt you.</v>

948
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

949
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get tapped out either way.</v>

950
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.741
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

951
00:27:23.741 --> 00:27:24.870
<v Speaker 1>if you breathe in,</v>

952
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to keep going and you're going to be able to learn.</v>

953
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just,</v>

954
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.071
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

955
00:27:28.071 --> 00:27:28.311
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

956
00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll walk you through shit,</v>

957
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what to what to not do,</v>

958
00:27:31.051 --> 00:27:31.884
<v Speaker 1>where to put yourself,</v>

959
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 1>but this can't ever let that happen ever.</v>

960
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Even if you were going to lose,</v>

961
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:36.991
<v Speaker 1>even if you're,</v>

962
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:37.351
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

963
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get tapped out.</v>

964
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever let yourself freak.</v>

965
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.273
<v Speaker 1>He can't freak.</v>

966
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>And in a real emergency,</v>

967
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say some type of straight over vacation where,</v>

968
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe there's a lot more on the line than a trophy or a medal or you</v>

969
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

970
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 1>like your life ego in the class.</v>

971
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Like your life.</v>

973
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

974
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:54.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

975
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>no one to breathe and keep calm.</v>

976
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

977
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:58.051
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

978
00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:58.801
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

979
00:27:58.801 --> 00:27:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>

980
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Keep your mind clear,</v>

981
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a lot of practice and you have to do it.</v>

982
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of really cool breathing exercises that you can do.</v>

983
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Even just walking,</v>

984
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 1>jogging,</v>

985
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

986
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>even with your exercises and so forth,</v>

987
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 1>everyone can lose anyone especially that's learning and developing.</v>

988
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 1>You can lose and you're probably going to lose,</v>

989
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in sparring or whether it's in competition when you come up against</v>

990
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 1>someone who's better than you.</v>

991
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between losing and losing composure and breaking.</v>

992
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>You know that that term breaking when you feel a guy give up.</v>

993
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.860
<v Speaker 1>We've all seen it.</v>

994
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it in fights and some guys just don't break.</v>

995
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a brief example.</v>

996
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones doesn't break.</v>

997
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't break.</v>

998
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:43.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

999
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:45.090
<v Speaker 1>he might take breathers.</v>

1000
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.661
<v Speaker 1>He might,</v>

1001
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:46.494
<v Speaker 1>but he is,</v>

1002
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.333
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>

1003
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.690
<v Speaker 1>He in his mind,</v>

1004
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.190
<v Speaker 1>he's the greatest of all time.</v>

1005
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 1>He's going to figure out how to beat you.</v>

1006
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a foregone conclusion.</v>

1007
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to tap.</v>

1008
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Like when he fought Vitor Belfort,</v>

1009
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Vitor Belfort caught him in a beautiful arm bar from the guard and had his arm</v>

1010
00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 1>completely hyperextended ruined his arm.</v>

1011
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean his arm,</v>

1012
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 1>John's arm was fucked up for like months afterwards.</v>

1013
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 1>He had to take a Gig on the ultimate fighter and coach for a long time because</v>

1014
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't able to train and he wasn't,</v>

1015
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 1>he was not going to be able to fight for at least like six months to let that</v>

1016
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>arm heal.</v>

1017
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't matter.</v>

1018
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:16.881
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1019
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>he was not going to tap like he was gonna get his arm broken and he was going to</v>

1020
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:20.461
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

1021
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 1>when he was gonna find a way to win,</v>

1022
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 1>he is not breaking.</v>

1023
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other guys,</v>

1024
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 1>the first moment where things go wrong,</v>

1025
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you see this look in their eye,</v>

1026
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:28.141
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1027
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:28.801
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1028
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it's going wrong.</v>

1029
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 1>They lose composure and like these,</v>

1030
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.540
<v Speaker 1>these doors that you go into with your mind,</v>

1031
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you get real comfortable entering these doors.</v>

1032
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 1>You get real comfortable entering these,</v>

1033
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 1>these areas of the mind.</v>

1034
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 3>And this can apply to all aspects of your life,</v>

1035
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1036
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1037
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.050
<v Speaker 3>like Jack Hurray got,</v>

1038
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1039
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 3>when he fought a Roger that perfect example,</v>

1040
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 3>perfect example.</v>

1041
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Did he wanted the win took the,</v>

1042
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.810
<v Speaker 3>the damage to the elbow fought one arm just to eke out the,</v>

1043
00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 3>the victory there was now.</v>

1044
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:02.170
<v Speaker 3>But I think for folks who don't know what we're talking about,</v>

1045
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.161
<v Speaker 3>Hodrick Gracie,</v>

1046
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 3>one of the very best black belts in the world and shock array,</v>

1047
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 3>one of the very best black belts in the world.</v>

1048
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Was it in the Monday owls?</v>

1049
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the open finals.</v>

1050
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:10.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:15.751
<v Speaker 3>It was a huge two world championship and hydro broke Jocker Rey's arm and Jah</v>

1052
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 3>courageous tuck that sucker in his belt and kept going.</v>

1053
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.493
<v Speaker 3>Kept going,</v>

1054
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.461
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1055
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 3>30 or 40 seconds.</v>

1056
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 3>So he just basically played outside edge of the mat because he had points.</v>

1057
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1058
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 3>he led them t he let them break his arm instead of table is crazy.</v>

1059
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Now for your,</v>

1060
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 3>for your listeners out there though,</v>

1061
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

1062
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.613
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that.</v>

1063
00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about hardcore professional athletes that make their living</v>

1064
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 3>fighting world championships in the lime,</v>

1065
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.690
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars in the line.</v>

1067
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 3>But in class.</v>

1068
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:48.971
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

1070
00:30:48.971 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 3>one of those guys that like,</v>

1073
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.480
<v Speaker 3>you track me.</v>

1074
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.081
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1075
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1076
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.170

1079
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 3>You got me in the trap.</v>

1080
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 3>I made a mistake.</v>

1081
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I acknowledge it,</v>

1082
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1083
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean a fight a little bit.</v>

1084
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:06.011
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1085
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I feel like,</v>

1086
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>ah Nah,</v>

1087

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 3>it's just so good about it.</v>

1089
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 3>So important to tap.</v>

1090
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.160
<v Speaker 3>The biggest mistakes I've ever made in training is not tapping,</v>

1091
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.500
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're over 45 and these guys that are want to,</v>

1092
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.421
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1093
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 3>that brings up another subject.</v>

1094
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1095
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I've been really doing a lot of work with Jujitsu for a lifetime.</v>

1096
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1103
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>let's show what happened to Jack Arrays.</v>

1104
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.181
<v Speaker 3>Obo Too,</v>

1105
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:34.631
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1106
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Jack,</v>

1107
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 3>he had surgery on his elbow and they pulled these chunks of,</v>

1108
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.650
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1109
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 3>of bone that were broken off and cartilage inside his elbow.</v>

1110
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I never heard about the aftermath.</v>

1111
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was pretty messed up,</v>

1112
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.700
<v Speaker 3>but I never heard exactly what he had to do to repair that.</v>

1113
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

1114
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 3>It was bad.</v>

1115
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1116
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.140
<v Speaker 3>he had it recently repaired,</v>

1117
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 3>had to repaired back then.</v>

1118
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 3>But the damage,</v>

1119
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 3>all the cartilage and all the stuff that's broken off inside of his elbow was</v>

1120
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 3>just swimming around in his elbow,</v>

1121
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.830
<v Speaker 3>messing with his at some serious,</v>

1122
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:03.521
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1123
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:04.360
<v Speaker 3>it's so painful.</v>

1124
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:04.541
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1125
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 3>you can't extend your arm all the way while your body builds up,</v>

1126
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1127
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>bone and calcification around that injury and you get those osteophytes and</v>

1128
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.233
<v Speaker 3>before you know it,</v>

1129
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.700
<v Speaker 3>you pretty much lose range of motion and your,</v>

1130
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:16.563
<v Speaker 3>your joints,</v>

1131
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.710
<v Speaker 3>the surgery,</v>

1132
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1133
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.521

00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 3>he put a online and it was just like so disgusting.</v>

1135
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.291
<v Speaker 3>Bad News,</v>

1136
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:24.124
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1137
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I do love to avoid surgery.</v>

1138
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1141
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 3>it was a five hour surgery just to clean out his elbow.</v>

1142
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Look at this and it's a good chance a man that was really nasty,</v>

1143
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.031
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1144
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>even after the surgery there's a good chance that never going to be the savvy</v>

1145
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1146
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Very good chance.</v>

1147
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Very good chance.</v>

1148
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1149
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:47.030
<v Speaker 1>they're finding out ways now with stem cells to regenerate cartilage,</v>

1150
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 1>like for the first time ever,</v>

1151
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>football players are doing it.</v>

1152
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>They're using it on an older folk that have add bone to bone arthritis for</v>

1153
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:54.240
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1154
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing,</v>

1155
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1156
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:56.560
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1157
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>We're going to break time.</v>

1158
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.300
<v Speaker 1>We're in a great time.</v>

1159
00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>If we could just live long enough,</v>

1160
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1161
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 1>just get me placing parts for everything grown from our own bodies,</v>

1163
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1164
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Well it's very possible that that is going to happen,</v>

1166
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 1>but also very possible that they're just going to be able to regenerate tissue,</v>

1167
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.860
<v Speaker 1>that all your injured tissue,</v>

1168
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.430
<v Speaker 1>all your damaged area,</v>

1169
00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 1>so just going to be able to regenerate them.</v>

1170
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like star Trek,</v>

1171
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:17.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1172
00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Where they used to take that little thing and then go over your body and you're</v>

1173
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:21.884
<v Speaker 1>healed now.</v>

1174
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1175
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy in Germany,</v>

1176
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.321
<v Speaker 1>a doctor,</v>

1177
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Peter Weller,</v>

1178
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 1>who is the same guy who created that Regena keen process that all the pro</v>

1179
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

1180
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.220
<v Speaker 1>they were flying over to Germany for doing to do it and now they go to a,</v>

1181
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a company called lifespan medicine that does it in Santa Monica and they</v>

1182
00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Speaker 1>do in Dallas and I,</v>

1183
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I believe they're opening up other offices as well.</v>

1184
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 1>They take your blood out,</v>

1185
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>they spin it in a centrifuge and the heat it up and the reaction to the heat</v>

1186
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.250
<v Speaker 1>makes your blood produce this really intense anti inflammatory.</v>

1187
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And I've had it done a lot.</v>

1188
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have had really chronic injuries,</v>

1189
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 1>had it done and it's works miracles.</v>

1190
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1191
00:33:57.381 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>he's developed this full body MRI machine,</v>

1192
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.940
<v Speaker 1>which literally just get some map of everything going on in your body.</v>

1193
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And once he went and did it,</v>

1194
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 1>he developed this and found out he had colon cancer.</v>

1195
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1196
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1197
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>he had no idea.</v>

1198
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.440
<v Speaker 1>A particularly tough,</v>

1199
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 1>aggressive type of colon cancer and caught it right away.</v>

1200
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1201
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Early on went into surgery.</v>

1202
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>No it's fine.</v>

1203
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's like this is how amazing it is.</v>

1204
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing that it actually worked and benefited the guy who created it.</v>

1205
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.941
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1206
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Stash to be the beneficiary of your own inventions and discoveries,</v>

1209
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it's also a reward for being on the cutting edge of healing and science for this</v>

1210
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>guy and the medical science.</v>

1211
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:41.091
<v Speaker 1>But let's,</v>

1220
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.640
<v Speaker 5>You laugh when you're on the ground.</v>

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:30.670
<v Speaker 6>a big part of what you do to keep healthy and keep your,</v>

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.630
<v Speaker 3>You guys have surf lessons,</v>

1270
00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you're going to teach Jujitsu.</v>

1271
00:36:37.191 --> 00:36:42.191
<v Speaker 3>Teach different ways of increasing your joint flexibility and preventing</v>

1272
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.530
<v Speaker 3>injuries and just haven't got just how to stay with it for a lifetime.</v>

1273
00:36:47.531 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 3>And like for guys that want to just stick with what they love doing.</v>

1274
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.480
<v Speaker 3>You wrote an article about it recently?</v>

1275
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1276
00:36:53.721 --> 00:36:53.931
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1277
00:36:53.931 --> 00:36:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean like most guys,</v>

1278
00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.590
<v Speaker 3>by the time they hit 40 or they're not going to be doing that anymore,</v>

1279
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.350
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to quit because they're going about it wrong.</v>

1280
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.210
<v Speaker 3>And I was on that path myself.</v>

1281
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1282
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.750
<v Speaker 3>when I was in my mid forties I'd be getting up in the morning.</v>

1283
00:37:05.751 --> 00:37:06.140
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1284
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:06.951
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1285
00:37:06.951 --> 00:37:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I can barely turn around to back my car out of the garage.</v>

1286
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:10.580
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking,</v>

1287
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.413
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

1288
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 3>what's what is going to be like in 10 years from now if I'm just in my mid</v>

1289
00:37:15.141 --> 00:37:18.590
<v Speaker 3>forties already suffering this pain and stiffness and inflammation.</v>

1290
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.370
<v Speaker 3>So I started really investigating the different exercises,</v>

1291
00:37:22.371 --> 00:37:22.851
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

1292
00:37:22.851 --> 00:37:24.020
<v Speaker 3>mobility systems.</v>

1293
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Of course I've always been interested in died,</v>

1294
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:26.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1295
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.070
<v Speaker 3>experimenting and so forth.</v>

1296
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.240
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1297
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1298
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this for a long time and I discovered a lot of really good</v>

1299
00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1300
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.090
<v Speaker 3>I like to share with people so that you can continue to do what you love so we</v>

1301
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:40.940
<v Speaker 3>can all be like master Elliot Gracie and you know,</v>

1302
00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 3>95 years old.</v>

1303
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:43.064
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1304
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 3>getting on the Mat and still having fun with it.</v>

1305
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1306
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.671
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1307
00:37:46.671 --> 00:37:48.170
<v Speaker 3>he was fanatical about his diet.</v>

1308
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 3>He was fanatical about his died.</v>

1309
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.301
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1310
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.650
<v Speaker 3>as you get older you have to be,</v>

1311
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.520
<v Speaker 3>you got to,</v>

1312
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:57.520
<v Speaker 3>you got to be more and more fanatical as the old aging process starts to set in.</v>

1313
00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.181
<v Speaker 3>When I was young,</v>

1314
00:37:59.181 --> 00:38:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I think I was just less aware of what was going on.</v>

1315
00:38:01.881 --> 00:38:03.410
<v Speaker 3>When I ate bad food.</v>

1316
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just less aware.</v>

1317
00:38:04.551 --> 00:38:05.181
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>

1318
00:38:05.181 --> 00:38:05.331
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1319
00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:05.931
<v Speaker 3>this tastes good.</v>

1320
00:38:05.931 --> 00:38:06.910
<v Speaker 3>What a great cheeseburger,</v>

1321
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.763
<v Speaker 3>tastes awesome.</v>

1322
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:08.840
<v Speaker 3>But I wasn't really,</v>

1323
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't as conscious about the actual effects.</v>

1324
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Whereas now I'm pretty aware of what kind of state my body's in.</v>

1325
00:38:16.251 --> 00:38:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Like very frustrating for me if I'm,</v>

1326
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.320
<v Speaker 3>if my mind is an adult place,</v>

1327
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:24.980
<v Speaker 3>like especially if I have to do interviews early in the morning and I just</v>

1328
00:38:24.981 --> 00:38:28.490
<v Speaker 3>haven't quite woken up yet and I'm having conversations in the words just aren't</v>

1329
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.840
<v Speaker 3>coming out that good.</v>

1330
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 3>They're just clumsy and it's frustrating.</v>

1331
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:33.871
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

1332
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:38.871
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty aware of like when I'm at my optimum state and I really notice now if</v>

1333
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 3>I eat crappy food,</v>

1334
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I really notice if I,</v>

1335
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 3>if I have like something that's like got a lot of bread in it or something</v>

1336
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 3>that's just an unhealthy deep fried nonsense,</v>

1337
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1338

00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1392
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.471
<v Speaker 3>it looks like,</v>

1393
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:57.304

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1399

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.350
<v Speaker 3>But it's sweet.</v>

1401
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 3>You just chew it and spit the seeds and it's absolutely delicious.</v>

1432
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 3>It was like a raw foods place and they would sell them.</v>

1433
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.261
<v Speaker 3>But my guide,</v>

1434
00:40:45.261 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 3>they were like a fucking arm and a leg man.</v>

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 3>And I'm seeing these things in the ground.</v>

1445
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 3>And I look up and there's a tree and it was like hundreds of them just laying</v>

1446
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:11.291
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1447
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:12.124
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1448
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I got some plastic baggies,</v>

1449
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1450
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

1451
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 3>you were sure that it was that.</v>

1452
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1453
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.303
<v Speaker 3>I tasted it.</v>

1454
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1455
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1456
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.171
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1457
00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:20.770
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1458
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:21.810
<v Speaker 3>this is a carrot,</v>

1459
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's a carob tree growing right here.</v>

1460
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Pull the [inaudible] image rather,</v>

1461
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.170
<v Speaker 3>and Marina County carob tree look like.</v>

1462
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever,</v>

1463
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think I've ever seen that.</v>

1464
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.160
<v Speaker 3>Like if I looked at that,</v>

1465
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 3>like that one looks like a bundle of snakes,</v>

1466
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 3>that third picture from the top,</v>

1467
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 3>but it was right there on the right.</v>

1468
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1469
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.501
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1470
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:40.334
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1471
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1472
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.910
<v Speaker 3>I was just utterly shocked because,</v>

1473
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1474
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I had been paying a lot of money for these damn things and there they were just</v>

1475
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1476
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.760
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1477
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that they even grew in California.</v>

1478
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 3>How long does it last once you get it from the tree?</v>

1479
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:54.291
<v Speaker 3>Does it go bad?</v>

1480
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 3>And Ron,</v>

1481
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1482
00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.201
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1483
00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:55.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1484
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 3>they're like dried.</v>

1485
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1486
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 3>is there like a dried pod that you could just keep for a long time?</v>

1487
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Probably years.</v>

1488
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:01.821
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1489
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1490
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1491
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're really tasty.</v>

1492
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It's really nice little sweet.</v>

1493
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 3>You know what it's like.</v>

1494
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1495
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1496
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.391
<v Speaker 3>white sugar,</v>

1497
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 3>white granulated sugar is probably one of the worst things you can eat.</v>

1498
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Toxic.</v>

1499
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1500
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Toxic,</v>

1501
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1502
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 3>But sugar cane actually,</v>

1503
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 3>like from the cane field actually has a lot of health benefit.</v>

1505
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really,</v>

1506
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:21.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1507
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.491
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1508
00:42:21.491 --> 00:42:22.131
<v Speaker 3>it's sweet.</v>

1509
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:22.964
<v Speaker 3>It has fiber,</v>

1510
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>it has a lot of nutrients,</v>

1511
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 3>minerals and so forth.</v>

1512
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously,</v>

1513
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't eat a lot of it cause it's powerful stuff.</v>

1515
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:30.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1516
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of those very powerful foods.</v>

1517
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 3>But the carob pods,</v>

1518
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 3>it kind of like the same thing.</v>

1519
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 3>If you do have a bit of a sweet tooth or you know,</v>

1520
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:40.560
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1521
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:40.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1522
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a fantastic way to,</v>

1523
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.560
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>

1524
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 3>sate your sweet tooth and wow.</v>

1525
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 3>The fiber is amazing really.</v>

1526
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I really was not aware at all.</v>

1527
00:42:49.371 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I always thought of Carob is like something that you yeah,</v>

1528
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:53.720
<v Speaker 3>like the process stuff like chocolate.</v>

1529
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:54.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1530
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 3>It's about as bad as chocolate.</v>

1531
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:57.430
<v Speaker 3>The way they process isn't really.</v>

1532
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1533
00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1534
00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:58.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1535
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:02.110
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little less harsh on your system because a lot of people have a</v>

1536
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 3>chocolate sensitivities.</v>

1537
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1538
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.830
<v Speaker 3>you always hear about gluten or dairy,</v>

1539
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.860
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

1540
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have a lot of sensitivity to chocolate.</v>

1541
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of,</v>

1542
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different things out there that had been overeating for years and years</v>

1543
00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 3>and years that can give you food sensitivities.</v>

1544
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1545
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 3>some chocolate's really good,</v>

1546
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:19.371
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1547
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Like raw chocolate is very high and,</v>

1548
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.020
<v Speaker 3>but some people are very sensitive to the,</v>

1549
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1550
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.973
<v Speaker 3>acids.</v>

1551
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Really fourth and chocolate.</v>

1552
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this Caribbean then is,</v>

1553
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.351
<v Speaker 3>how do you say it?</v>

1554
00:43:29.351 --> 00:43:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Cut Cow,</v>

1555
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 3>cow,</v>

1556
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.670
<v Speaker 3>cow,</v>

1557
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.503
<v Speaker 3>cow.</v>

1558
00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.373
<v Speaker 3>The raw chocolates,</v>

1559
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.940
<v Speaker 3>the raw chocolate and that stuff is really good for you,</v>

1560
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:35.171
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1561
00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1562
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 3>it can be,</v>

1563
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 3>can be for some people it's like,</v>

1564
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's powerful stuff and if you overeat anything,</v>

1565
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 3>you're going to develop a po potential,</v>

1566
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.143
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1567
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:44.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1568
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.373
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity.</v>

1569
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1570
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1571
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.273
<v Speaker 3>as I think gluten,</v>

1572
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 3>gluten in itself is not all that bad.</v>

1573
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1574
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:53.720
<v Speaker 3>But Americans had been just eating it like crazy,</v>

1575
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1576
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 3>toast in the morning.</v>

1577
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.361
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1578
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:57.194
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1579
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:57.610
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1580
00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1581
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.680
<v Speaker 3>it was cereal and then sandwich for lunch,</v>

1582
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.603
<v Speaker 3>pasta for dinner,</v>

1583
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>dinner rolls and it's just like they're getting inundated.</v>

1584
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Well like God,</v>

1585
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you could probably develop a food sensitivity to anything if you probably you</v>

1586
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.070
<v Speaker 3>could get eggs or chicken sensitivity or something if you just ate it,</v>

1587
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1588
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:16.700
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1589
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.020
<v Speaker 3>three square meals a day.</v>

1590
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty certain of that.</v>

1591
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I went for a while more than six months where I just didn't touch any gluten.</v>

1592
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:25.761
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1593
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 3>let me see what happens.</v>

1594
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 3>One thing I lost weight.</v>

1595
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty shocked at like how easy it was.</v>

1596
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Like my body thinned out,</v>

1597
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.410
<v Speaker 3>lost body fat,</v>

1598
00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 3>my face got thinner.</v>

1599
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1600
00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 3>I carry fat in my face.</v>

1601
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm like one of those dudes,</v>

1602
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.233
<v Speaker 3>I carry fat.</v>

1603
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.073
<v Speaker 3>If I get fat,</v>

1604
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 3>love handles and I get it in my face.</v>

1605
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it in my arms.</v>

1606
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it in my legs,</v>

1607
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:49.960
<v Speaker 3>but I get it my like around my belly and my sides and I get it at my face and</v>

1608
00:44:49.961 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Speaker 3>all that went wrong.</v>

1609
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.800
<v Speaker 3>My fish shrunk down and my son,</v>

1610
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.161
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1611
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:53.341
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1612
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:54.174
<v Speaker 3>this is interesting.</v>

1613
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting how the fat patterns just shrink up.</v>

1614
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.790
<v Speaker 3>There's three major fat distributions,</v>

1615
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1616
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You got your depo fat.</v>

1617
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 3>That's like the love handles or with women and sometimes it's the saddlebags and</v>

1618
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:06.834
<v Speaker 3>the side of the thigh.</v>

1619
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you'll see a women and the upper back or the tricep area with guys.</v>

1620
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:13.120
<v Speaker 3>That's usually the La yeah,</v>

1621
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.930
<v Speaker 3>or the belly or the love handles for most guys,</v>

1622
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1623
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Speaker 3>then you have internal fat.</v>

1624
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the dangerous stuff.</v>

1625
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.760
<v Speaker 3>They intra abdominal fat,</v>

1626
00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 3>that gut fat,</v>

1627
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

1628
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.040
<v Speaker 3>that's what can kill you.</v>

1629
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1630
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 3>then you have subcutaneous fat.</v>

1631
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like the smooth fat underneath the skin,</v>

1632
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1633
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 3>like an insulation layer.</v>

1634
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 3>And then of course they've identified that Brown fat also,</v>

1635
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like a act of fat.</v>

1636
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 3>It produces heat in the body.</v>

1637
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like part of the survival mechanism.</v>

1638
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Back when our ancestors had to tolerate a lot of extremes in temperatures like</v>

1639
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.603
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

1640
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you have this brown fat,</v>

1641
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like an metabolically active fat and uh,</v>

1642
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:49.651
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1643
00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 3>it's kids have it,</v>

1644
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 3>but by the time you were like 12 and almost disappears because you know,</v>

1645
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:54.751
<v Speaker 3>we have this,</v>

1646
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1647
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1648
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 3>regulated temperatures all the time.</v>

1649
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.730
<v Speaker 3>People don't expose themselves to cold.</v>

1650
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.670
<v Speaker 3>They're always bundling up and the homes are overheated.</v>

1651
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.660
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1652
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1653
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.760
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people were saying,</v>

1654
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 3>now you can actually get that metabolically active fat.</v>

1655
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 3>The brown fat Sal's gone,</v>

1656
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.990
<v Speaker 3>which helps keep you ween and helps burn the other yellow fat.</v>

1657
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 3>So cold showers,</v>

1658
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:19.870
<v Speaker 3>cold water treatments,</v>

1659
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 3>exposing yourself to cold,</v>

1660
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.980
<v Speaker 3>a real good thing for develop that and uh,</v>

1661
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 3>the brown fat and build your immune system and you,</v>

1662
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you have a much better tolerance to cold and much less likely to get a</v>

1663
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 3>innervated and cold weather.</v>

1664
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have a tendency to come down with colds or flu and stuff like</v>

1665
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 3>really brown fat,</v>

1666
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Brown fat.</v>

1667
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard of that before.</v>

1668
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:42.570
<v Speaker 3>And what is it created by?</v>

1669
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Like what it's in your,</v>

1670
00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:44.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1671
00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 3>some of it's in the peritoneal cavity,</v>

1672
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 3>some of it's a up in the neck,</v>

1673
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1674
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.553
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

1675
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.453
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1676
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:51.261
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1677
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 3>it's just something that nature provided to help temperature regulation,</v>

1678
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 3>helping tolerate cold.</v>

1679
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 3>So it was that like more common with Inuits and folks who live in real.</v>

1680
00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:00.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1681
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1682
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 3>They have well developed brown fat,</v>

1683
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 3>but you and I could do it too if we just expose yourself a little bit more to</v>

1684
00:47:06.361 --> 00:47:07.194
<v Speaker 3>the cold.</v>

1685
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I have you done any cryotherapy if you've done any of that and not as uh,</v>

1686
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>

1687
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 3>like the way it's been used.</v>

1688
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 3>How long are you in town for?</v>

1689
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1690
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.260
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

1691
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.810
<v Speaker 3>What am I going down to San Diego?</v>

1692

<v Speaker 3>That's a 20th through the 22nd march in San Diego.</v>

<v Speaker 3>250 degrees below zero.</v>

1704
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 3>You go into like a meat locker.</v>

1705
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:37.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1707
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:38.591
<v Speaker 3>is crazy.</v>

1708
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 3>You put on a surgical mask,</v>

1709
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>you put on ear muffs,</v>

1710
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:46.350
<v Speaker 3>you wear socks that go up to your like knee high socks and like those rubber</v>

1711
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 3>crocs cause you don't want to stand on the floor.</v>

1712
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1713
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And you were also wearing gloves anywhere.</v>

1714
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Underwear,</v>

1715
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 3>very important ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1716
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want to have any moisture in your body.</v>

1717
00:47:55.521 --> 00:47:55.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1718
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.390
<v Speaker 3>ever want to go there.</v>

1719
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.223
<v Speaker 3>Sweaty.</v>

1720
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1721
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 3>You go there for three minutes,</v>

1722
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.860
<v Speaker 3>three minutes at 250 degrees below zero and it is cold as fuck.</v>

1723
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 3>And all I do is I just concentrate on staying calm and breathing and I breathed</v>

1724
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 3>and I count and that's what I do.</v>

1725
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:12.364
<v Speaker 3>I go one,</v>

1726
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1727
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 3>three and I try to count slower than a minute so that when they give you a timer</v>

1728
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 3>you have one minute remaining.</v>

1729
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 3>So when I count that minute down,</v>

1730
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I always want to make sure that I'm not one,</v>

1731
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:23.321
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1732
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:23.561
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1733
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:24.394
<v Speaker 3>four bucks.</v>

1734
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm counting slower than the actual build up.</v>

1735
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Do you like maybe start at 30 seconds and build up each time?</v>

1736
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Or I did.</v>

1737
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:33.521
<v Speaker 3>The first time they did it,</v>

1738
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:34.840
<v Speaker 3>they put me in for two minutes and I said,</v>

1739
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:35.711
<v Speaker 3>and they'd go,</v>

1740
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 3>well the first time,</v>

1741
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 3>do you want to try it?</v>

1742
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1743
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 3>don't go into long,</v>

1744
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:39.821
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>

1745
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:39.941
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1746
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:40.061
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1747
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1748
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:40.931
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

1749
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1750
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:41.521
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1751
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:42.910
<v Speaker 3>what's the longest I could do it?</v>

1752
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And they said three minutes.</v>

1753
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.651
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

1754
00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:44.811
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1755
00:48:44.811 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 3>well I'll try your two minutes.</v>

1756
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:46.361
<v Speaker 3>I tried two minutes,</v>

1757
00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:46.571
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1758
00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it will last another minute.</v>

1759
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:48.221
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1760
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:49.054
<v Speaker 3>let's try another minute.</v>

1761
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.570
<v Speaker 3>So then I went in again and I did three minutes and now what I do is I do three</v>

1762
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

1763
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I take,</v>

1764
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:54.933
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1765
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe five,</v>

1766
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 3>six minutes off and I get on an elliptical machine and warm up and then I'll go</v>

1767
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 3>back in for another three minutes.</v>

1768
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's amazing to me.</v>

1769
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 3>For years I did the,</v>

1770
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1771
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.240
<v Speaker 3>the dousing.</v>

1772
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice bath or bucket bit,</v>

1773
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1774
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.050
<v Speaker 3>ice bucket challenge.</v>

1775
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1776
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 3>it's funny cause I had been doing this years and years before when I lived in</v>

1777
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Philly.</v>

1778
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I had a backyard that was pretty much secluded with a big wall so I could</v>

1779
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.124
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

1780
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 3>strip down naked in my backyard and my neighbors couldn't see me.</v>

1782
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 3>And in the back corner I had this big Spec it and I had a five gallon bucket and</v>

1783
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:34.021
<v Speaker 3>the all year long I would go and very slowly pour a five gallon bucket for</v>

1784
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 3>starting with the admin up over the head and down the back.</v>

1785
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 3>And the Russians that had taught me this said that it creates like this</v>

1786
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 3>artificial flash fever that is not quite the same thing with the shower,</v>

1787
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:50.920
<v Speaker 3>which is more prolonged because you're doubting yourself with a sudden</v>

1788
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.813
<v Speaker 3>immersion.</v>

1789
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like plunging into like a cold lake.</v>

1790
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.953
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1791
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 3>it's supposedly burns up any bacteria or germs or whatever,</v>

1792
00:49:59.681 --> 00:50:00.514
<v Speaker 3>and your body.</v>

1793
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:04.140
<v Speaker 3>All I know is that for the years I did it in Philadelphia,</v>

1794
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.870
<v Speaker 3>15 years when I had,</v>

1795
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 3>when I was a householder,</v>

1796
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a cold.</v>

1797
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1798
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I did not get a cold.</v>

1799
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 3>People around me would have flu,</v>

1800
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 3>they'd be sick.</v>

1801
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>

1802
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 3>my immune system was like amazing.</v>

1803
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:19.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1804
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of this cryo therapy as a,</v>

1805
00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 3>it's been explained to me.</v>

1806
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 3>And if you go to Cryo health care.com,</v>

1807
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it is,</v>

1808
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I forget the website,</v>

1809
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but the name of the place in La is cryo healthcare.</v>

1810
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different styles of these cryo machines.</v>

1811
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 1>One of them is from the neck down.</v>

1812
00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You stand in and your head is outside and you don't have to put anything on your</v>

1813
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1814
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't find that one to be as effective.</v>

1815
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1816
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Certainly better than nothing.</v>

1817
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1818
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but the one we stepped into,</v>

1819
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.893
<v Speaker 1>the meat locker,</v>

1820
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:48.831
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1821
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:49.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a motherfucker.</v>

1822
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have one of those down the street and Woodland Hills,</v>

1823
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:52.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1824
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.483
<v Speaker 1>down the road a bit.</v>

1825
00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be putting out one of those within the next month or so.</v>

1826
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But that would certainly stimulate brown fat.</v>

1827
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1828
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:00.940
<v Speaker 1>with that thing.</v>

1829
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

1830
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:02.301
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

1831
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 1>see the meat locker one is the one on the left.</v>

1832
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:04.280
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1833
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they have that one.</v>

1834
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.790
<v Speaker 1>That one's fairly common kind of nationwide.</v>

1835
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.653
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>

1836
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the one that you see on the left,</v>

1837
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 1>the meat locker.</v>

1838
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the mother fuck that way,</v>

1839
00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1840
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

1841
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take you there.</v>

1842
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I say claustrophobic and that way,</v>

1843
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1844
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:15.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1845
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:16.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not claustrophobic.</v>

1846
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 1>You developed the door easy.</v>

1847
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1848
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 1>The little one just goes to like,</v>

1849
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1850
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:22.310
<v Speaker 1>The little one's easy.</v>

1851
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.480
<v Speaker 1>The little one's so easy.</v>

1852
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.931
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1853
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the little ones hard.</v>

1854
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 1>If you've never done it before,</v>

1855
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:27.081
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1856
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:27.914
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>

1857
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you've done it,</v>

1858
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:30.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1859
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.711
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1860
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the big one is like the little one.</v>

1861
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's that one right there.</v>

1862
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.953
<v Speaker 1>You just Kinda,</v>

1863
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 1>you climb out of it,</v>

1864
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:35.391
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

1865
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:35.991
<v Speaker 1>But the uh,</v>

1866
00:51:35.991 --> 00:51:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the big one has this amazing effect.</v>

1867
00:51:38.181 --> 00:51:38.811
<v Speaker 1>You get out of there,</v>

1868
00:51:38.811 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you could jump over buildings.</v>

1869
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:41.691
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

1870
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:42.524
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1871
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Once your body,</v>

1872
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.900
<v Speaker 1>like realizes that you're not going to die,</v>

1873
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 1>no one has dropped you in the top of the moon and it's on a hundred really,</v>

1874
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:52.220
<v Speaker 1>250 degrees below zero.</v>

1875
00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 1>That's literally the surface of the moon is 250 degrees below zero.</v>

1876
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1877
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.163
<v Speaker 1>In the dark.</v>

1878
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 1>The moon varies from like 250 degrees to 250 degrees below zero depending on</v>

1879
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the sun is hitting you or whether or not you're in the shade.</v>

1880
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like how all these things where even even training,</v>

1881
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1882
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:08.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1883
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1884
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 1>if training's done properly,</v>

1885
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.460
<v Speaker 1>your body perceives it as a threat to its survival.</v>

1886
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You basically are tapping into your survival mechanism with these things and</v>

1887
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 1>your body in its wisdom will say,</v>

1888
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:21.284
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1889
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite up to snuff here.</v>

1890
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I better adapt and get stronger so I don't die.</v>

1891
00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1892
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.741
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1893
00:52:27.741 --> 00:52:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that's training to weight training or,</v>

1894
00:52:29.531 --> 00:52:30.364
<v Speaker 1>or anything,</v>

1895
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1896
00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:30.971
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1897
00:52:30.971 --> 00:52:35.971
<v Speaker 1>you have to make it a stimulating enough and difficult enough to tap into that</v>

1898
00:52:36.351 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>survival mechanism so that if you're not,</v>

1899
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting the benefit of the training.</v>

1900
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Or in this case they cry a therapist.</v>

1901
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 1>So your body like an adaptation response.</v>

1902
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Well this is this new system that they're,</v>

1903
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 1>they've developed in Japan.</v>

1904
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It's called Kaatsu.</v>

1905
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1906
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the gentleman's name of created it,</v>

1907
00:52:57.561 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 1>but I had a chance to try it out this weekend in Austin.</v>

1908
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And what essentially is,</v>

1909
00:53:00.951 --> 00:53:01.784
<v Speaker 1>is like these,</v>

1910
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.680
<v Speaker 1>they take these straps and they constrict the outs like your,</v>

1911
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:07.401
<v Speaker 1>your Bicep,</v>

1912
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 1>like right below the,</v>

1913
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:08.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1914
00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:09.494
<v Speaker 1>the delts.</v>

1915
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you go through like a 15 minute routine,</v>

1916
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 1>like 15 minutes of you do curls,</v>

1917
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.401
<v Speaker 1>you start off,</v>

1918
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:17.234
<v Speaker 1>you do pushups,</v>

1919
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you do curls with a kettle bell to failure.</v>

1920
00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And all this is while your blood flow is restricted.</v>

1921
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:27.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you do like a ropes and you do sets of three for 15 minutes.</v>

1922
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the 15 minutes,</v>

1923
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking arms are dead.</v>

1924
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1925
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1926
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 1>cause you're restricting the blood flow and then they release it and take it</v>

1927
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1928
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the response that your body has to the fact that your blood flow</v>

1929
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 1>is restricted,</v>

1930
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 1>it triggers all sorts of,</v>

1931
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 1>of responses as far as your growth hormone,</v>

1932
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 1>your testosterone,</v>

1933
00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:47.311
<v Speaker 1>all these different,</v>

1934
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:47.481
<v Speaker 1>you be,</v>

1935
00:53:47.481 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 1>your body starts trying to compensate for the fact that it doesn't have enough</v>

1936
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:52.584
<v Speaker 1>blood flow.</v>

1937
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:57.650
<v Speaker 1>So it just over ramps everything up and it's apparently fantastic for healing.</v>

1938
00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic for people that have injuries.</v>

1939
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:05.451
<v Speaker 1>Recovery time from injuries reduces drastically like a Bodie Miller.</v>

1940
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:05.851
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1941
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:06.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1942
00:54:06.071 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 1>the Olympic skier.</v>

1943
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1944
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.821
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

1945
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 1>used it to get back in shape from a surgery like much quicker than he would have</v>

1946
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:13.914
<v Speaker 1>without it.</v>

1947
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.641
<v Speaker 1>That's just one,</v>

1948
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1949
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 1>one of these new methods,</v>

1950
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.540
<v Speaker 1>much like this cryo thing,</v>

1951
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 1>much like many of these other protocols where they're trying to figure out ways</v>

1952
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 1>to kind of trick your body into ramping up the healing process are ramping up</v>

1953
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1954
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:27.580
<v Speaker 1>so it's used for healing not for,</v>

1955
00:54:27.581 --> 00:54:30.930
<v Speaker 1>is trying to try any person for both for both was just been curious.</v>

1956
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It'd be interesting to see how it compares to just traditional strength training</v>

1957
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 1>as far as you know,</v>

1958
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 1>actual general strain.</v>

1959
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:38.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 1>And the idea also is that it puts a strong load on your muscles but not on your</v>

1961
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 1>joints because everything you're doing like say if you're doing like kettle bell</v>

1962
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 1>curls to failure.</v>

1963
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it with like a 35 pound kettle bell with two hands.</v>

1964
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not a lot of weight.</v>

1965
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not a lot of weight and just you're just cranking out reps,</v>

1966
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but because your biceps are tied off at the top,</v>

1967
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 1>he's just getting that blood crazy pumped and trapped up and to the ends of the</v>

1968
00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

1969
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1970
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 1>your arms just flows.</v>

1971
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:05.251
<v Speaker 1>We restrict it.</v>

1972
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

1973
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:05.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1974
00:55:05.731 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 1>they grow dry.</v>

1975
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 1>They look giant.</v>

1976
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Like your arms are giant.</v>

1977
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 1>It's painful,</v>

1978
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.081
<v Speaker 1>it's painful.</v>

1979
00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 1>But I just fucked around with it yesterday for the first time and apparently the</v>

1980
00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 1>results are amazing and a ad on it.</v>

1981
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to look into this and trying to,</v>

1982
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1983
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 1>see what we could do with it to bring this to the mainstream,</v>

1984
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 1>but to try to get more athletes involved doing things like this.</v>

1985
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:27.660
<v Speaker 1>We kind of get these,</v>

1986
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you get these results where you start going,</v>

1987
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:30.241
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1988
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:30.481
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1989
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 1>well if you do that and this,</v>

1990
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:37.970
<v Speaker 1>what if you do cryotherapy and this Kaatsu method and also the breathing also</v>

1991
00:55:38.221 --> 00:55:38.801
<v Speaker 1>that like what are,</v>

1992
00:55:38.801 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

1993
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:39.761
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

1994
00:55:39.761 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 1>the difference in the response to your body?</v>

1995
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the difference in how quickly you can heal,</v>

1996
00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 1>how quickly you can get in shape.</v>

1997
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big issue for MMA fighters is the downtime from injury and then</v>

1998
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 1>ramping your body back up to competition shape afterwards.</v>

1999
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.811
<v Speaker 1>You could tell,</v>

2000
00:55:54.811 --> 00:55:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody who's ever gotten to a very good fitness level and then got</v>

2001
00:55:58.261 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 1>injured,</v>

2002
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 1>it's so frustrating getting back to the gym and then trying to get back in</v>

2003
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:03.180
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

2004
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I said a lot of guys never,</v>

2005
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>never do get back because it's just such a hard row.</v>

2006
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2007
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.270
<v Speaker 1>such a hard road to,</v>

2008
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 1>to come back on.</v>

2009
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to accept the state that they're in.</v>

2010
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2011
00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:19.200
<v Speaker 1>like especially that's one of the issues with younger athletes.</v>

2012
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:19.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2013
00:56:19.771 --> 00:56:20.431
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>

2014
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:21.031
<v Speaker 1>you're 20,</v>

2015
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:22.140
<v Speaker 1>your body heals quick,</v>

2016
00:56:22.141 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you're just a wild motherfucker and your,</v>

2017
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 3>he'd doing anything you want your rank list and as you get older,</v>

2018
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:29.290
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things that I liked about your article that you wrote.</v>

2019
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You have to be smarter.</v>

2020
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.541
<v Speaker 3>You have to be smarter.</v>

2021
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 3>You have to recognize that your body's going to take longer to heal.</v>

2022
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 3>You can't be reckless with it.</v>

2023
00:56:35.621 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 3>And also you really should probably shouldn't have been reckless with it when</v>

2024
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:39.334
<v Speaker 3>you were 20.</v>

2025
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 3>But you could,</v>

2026
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you could get away with it to a certain extent.</v>

2027
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Now that you're older,</v>

2028
00:56:43.151 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to be wiser.</v>

2029
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2030
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks they're bulletproof and they're going to last forever.</v>

2031
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2032
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you just can't even imagine.</v>

2033
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I can remember going to a wrestling tournament.</v>

2034
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:52.421
<v Speaker 3>It was in York,</v>

2035
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

2036
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2037
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I used to do the summer wrestle freestyle wrestling circuit.</v>

2038
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 3>They used to have tournaments all over Pennsylvania.</v>

2039
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And I remember meeting a guy that was like 33 years old and I was just blown</v>

2040
00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:05.914
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2041
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.113
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

2042
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you're still wrestling you 33 Oh man,</v>

2043
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:10.571
<v Speaker 3>you're my new hero.</v>

2044
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

2045
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I want to be just like you went.</v>

2046
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And I just couldn't believe.</v>

2047
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:18.700
<v Speaker 3>I thought this guy was like ancient in was probably like 19 at the time.</v>

2048
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 3>And I could not believe that this guy was in there wrestling as well as he did</v>

2049
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.673
<v Speaker 3>at 33.</v>

2050
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:25.001
<v Speaker 3>That's that funny.</v>

2051
00:57:25.001 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Now you'd kill it.</v>

2052
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Do anything to get the 32 year old body man,</v>

2053
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 3>42 year old.</v>

2054
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.093
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2055
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 3>still fantastic,</v>

2056
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:33.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2057
00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 3>still feeling great.</v>

2058
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:35.471
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2059
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:35.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2060
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.041
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2061
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:36.874
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2062
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 3>as my grandfather said,</v>

2063
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 3>no one gets out of here alive.</v>

2064
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:40.680
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2065
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.130
<v Speaker 3>father time will take its toll over time,</v>

2067
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you're doing,</v>

2068
00:57:46.031 --> 00:57:48.040
<v Speaker 3>no matter how many therapies and so forth,</v>

2069
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:48.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2070
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.630
<v Speaker 3>but you tried to do your best with what she got and you do try to preserve your</v>

2071
00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 3>youth and your vitality.</v>

2072
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:54.840
<v Speaker 3>But one,</v>

2073
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 3>one of the major problems I see,</v>

2074
00:57:56.321 --> 00:58:01.321
<v Speaker 3>especially an extremist sports like Jujitsu or MMA or whatever,</v>

2075
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:02.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2076
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 3>is the overtraining.</v>

2077
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Everyone thinks more is better and it's not better's better,</v>

2078
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 3>but more is not better.</v>

2079
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge issue with rustling.</v>

2080
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2081
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

2082
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Wrestlers may are notoriously the most overtrained group of athletes there are,</v>

2083
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2084
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that training with the overtraining?</v>

2085
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't that develop this insane mental toughness that wrestlers are known for?</v>

2086
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:25.750
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it.</v>

2087
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.690
<v Speaker 3>The mental toughness is,</v>

2088
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:28.030
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2089
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:30.520
<v Speaker 3>is a huge part of it because that is a hard ass sport.</v>

2090
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Did you happen to see the,</v>

2091
00:58:31.721 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2092
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:33.123
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2093
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:34.663
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2094
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Foxcatcher the movie?</v>

2095
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.161
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2096
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

2097
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.091
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

2098
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:37.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2099
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.340
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't exactly accurate at all.</v>

2100
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2101
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Mark Schultz put up actually a thing on his Facebook page,</v>

2102
00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:43.670
<v Speaker 3>all the accuracies.</v>

2103
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2104
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:44.883
<v Speaker 3>That are in that movie.</v>

2105
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.030
<v Speaker 3>And they're pretty substantial.</v>

2106
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Pretty substantial.</v>

2107
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:47.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2108
00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2109
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.060
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

2110
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.780
<v Speaker 3>it's actually frustrating and annoying.</v>

2111
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 3>The guy's alive.</v>

2112
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.040
<v Speaker 3>He's an Olympic gold medalist world champion,</v>

2113
00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:55.240
<v Speaker 3>one of the best wrestlers,</v>

2114
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 3>really pretty much ever,</v>

2115
00:58:56.381 --> 00:58:57.214
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2116
00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2117
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 3>they portrayed him in a very inaccurate light.</v>

2118
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:01.323
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much so.</v>

2119
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2120
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2121
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 3>they made him look like a dumb jock.</v>

2122
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 3>The guy's brilliant.</v>

2123
00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 3>The guy was brilliant and a very articulate,</v>

2124
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:08.044
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy.</v>

2125
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:08.950
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2126
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 3>my college wrestling coach was the junior coach there.</v>

2127
00:59:13.031 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Foxcatcher rule.</v>

2128
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2129
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Dale bonds.</v>

2130
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:15.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2131
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:16.990
<v Speaker 3>he's in the college,</v>

2132
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 3>so he was a NCAA coaches hall of fame.</v>

2133
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2134
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>so this was</v>

2135
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 2>after you were in college visit?</v>

2136
00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 2>After I graduated from college,</v>

2137
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I was still living in Philly and you know,</v>

2138
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Dale used to invite me to come on down and a train now and again.</v>

2139
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:31.911
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2140
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I took him up on a couple of times.</v>

2141
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately it was just a little bit too far away to be driving,</v>

2142
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:36.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2143
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I had a day job.</v>

2144
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling is one of those sports that,</v>

2145
00:59:39.461 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2146
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much have to have your mid afternoons open cause that's when all the</v>

2147
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 2>universities train and that's when most guys train.</v>

2148
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:47.090
<v Speaker 2>So I was really,</v>

2149
00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:48.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2150
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Jones if for some grappling experience,</v>

2151
00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 2>but it was really hard working at job and at that time I was married and it</v>

2152
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 2>hauls holder with a family and all that.</v>

2153
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 2>But I think you're down a few times and I got a chance to tour the facility and</v>

2154
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 2>it was really impressive and a headache clinic with,</v>

2155
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2156
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.290

<v Speaker 2>And so I had a,</v>

2175
01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of clinics with that guy,</v>

2180
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>

01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And conditioning and wrestling.</v>

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like wow.</v>

2185
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely one of America's finest wrestlers ever.</v>

2186
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>But even more than his physical skills was as his mental skills.</v>

2187
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:50.640
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2188
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 2>he just had an amazing mind and I was really fortunate to have,</v>

2189

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190

<v Speaker 2>been able to travel in those type of circles and get a chance to see it.</v>

2191
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>But this is after my,</v>

2192
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:01.521
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2193
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2194
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>college wrestling days.</v>

2195
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.210
<v Speaker 2>So I was looking for that thing to fill the gap,</v>

2196
01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:05.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2197

<v Speaker 2>There's so many tough people from that part of the world.</v>

2208
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:26.361
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2209
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

2210
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2211
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2212
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our best fighters come from the poorer sections of America.</v>

2213
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:33.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2214
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>kids come up in the projects and you know,</v>

2215
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>some of these inner city kids,</v>

2216
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2217
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

2218
01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2219
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 2>like in Philly or Detroit or Mandy gets him tough kids.</v>

2220
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>They grew up scrapping and it builds a mental toughness sometimes,</v>

2221
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:48.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2222
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>like a Mike Tyson growing up where,</v>

2223
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>where he did and a hell's kitchen up there in New York.</v>

2224
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean Brownsville ox or Brownsville.</v>

2225
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>So I mean those guys are just,</v>

2227
01:01:59.180 --> 01:01:59.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:01:59.511 --> 01:01:59.621
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2229
01:01:59.621 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>they grow up in a really tough neighborhood.</v>

2230
01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like dog eat dog and it produces like a really tough kind of minded</v>

2231
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2232
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of these eastern European countries,</v>

2233
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2234
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't have much and you know,</v>

2235
01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:13.451
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2236
01:02:13.451 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2237
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2238
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:14.991
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2239
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:15.824
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2240
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of time in their hands.</v>

2241
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot to do for the kids.</v>

2242
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:19.741
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2243
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>they end</v>

2244
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.000
<v Speaker 3>up like most boys,</v>

2245
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:21.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>getting into trouble and fighting and doing all this kind of crazy stuff.</v>

2247
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the reasons why,</v>

2248
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2249
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.200
<v Speaker 3>this new urban playground gymnastics kind of stuffed at the guys are doing,</v>

2250
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 3>it's become so popular because I mean,</v>

2251
01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2252
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty available.</v>

2253
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just equipment.</v>

2254
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Just sitting there cost very little to put it in.</v>

2255
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Did we play that video of you there?</v>

2256
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Last time we were here with the Wa with the bar stars,</v>

2257
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:45.263
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty cool.</v>

2258
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.553
<v Speaker 3>Pretty cool man.</v>

2259
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 3>But in eastern Europe that stuff's really popular,</v>

2260
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:50.280
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2261
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.113
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2262
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2263
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a lot to do.</v>

2264
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.300
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the same kind of uh,</v>

2265
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 3>basketball courts that we do and they,</v>

2266
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the facilities all the times,</v>

2267
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.300
<v Speaker 3>but wrestling is pretty cheap,</v>

2268
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:03.910
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2269
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2270
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2271
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't take a lot of equipment,</v>

2272
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 3>anybody just wrestling really.</v>

2273
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of boxers right now that are coming out of the bar,</v>

2274
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 3>the world as well.</v>

2275
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2280
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had the opportunity to actually see him.</v>

2281
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.420
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfucker around.</v>

2282
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>It can be Bernard Hopkins.</v>

2283
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.950
<v Speaker 3>And then he just beat John Pascale the other night.</v>

2284
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.760

2287
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 3>The way he moves.</v>

2288
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:30.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2289
01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 3>he really makes boxing exciting again.</v>

2290
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.153
<v Speaker 3>He's a killer.</v>

2291
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Just goes for the kill,</v>

2292
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:35.611
<v Speaker 3>like constantly,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like everything about his movement.</v>

2295
01:03:38.421 --> 01:03:39.340
<v Speaker 3>It's very technical.</v>

2296
01:03:39.341 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 3>It's foot work is his ditzes distancing the economy of his movements,</v>

2297
01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:44.880
<v Speaker 3>the way throws punches.</v>

2298
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:45.990

<v Speaker 3>tough guys coming out of Russia of that area.</v>

2304
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2305
01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 3>that part of the world is so former Soviet Union.</v>

2306
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:57.541

2316
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a lot of the Slavic countries too.</v>

2317
01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2318
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Serbia and Slovenia and man,</v>

2319
01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:13.911
<v Speaker 3>the gods are huge big strapping guys and you just don't see the obesity either.</v>

2320
01:04:14.971 --> 01:04:15.804
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2321
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the food,</v>

2322
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2323
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 3>they can't afford just to overeat like we do in America or you know,</v>

2324
01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2325
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 3>the rest of Europe or the UK or whatever.</v>

2326
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2327
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.210
<v Speaker 3>you see some,</v>

2328
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.531
<v Speaker 3>some real fatties,</v>

2330
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:28.891
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

2331
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:29.724
<v Speaker 3>when you're there,</v>

2332
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:30.091
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2333
01:04:30.091 --> 01:04:33.990
<v Speaker 3>people are pretty pretty lean and wiring and stringy and a lot of the younger</v>

2334
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:36.240
<v Speaker 3>guys are just like specimens.</v>

2335
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether it's genetics or it has to be,</v>

2336
01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean you think about the people that have lived and gotten through those harsh</v>

2337
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:47.061
<v Speaker 3>climates and tough jobs and just had to work survival of the fittest and that's,</v>

2338
01:04:47.311 --> 01:04:49.800
<v Speaker 3>those are the people that bread and those are the people that kept going.</v>

2339
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:54.150
<v Speaker 3>We what you notice also about a lot of those people from that part of the world</v>

2340
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:54.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2341
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.760
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting enough was not just that they're tough,</v>

2342
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.500
<v Speaker 3>but they're very technical.</v>

2343
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really technical wrestling that comes out of Russia and a out</v>

2344
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 3>of the former Soviet Union,</v>

2345
01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:04.861
<v Speaker 3>that area,</v>

2346
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 3>like those guys,</v>

2347
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 3>those Russian nationals that went up to Montreal,</v>

2348
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of weird.</v>

2349
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:11.730
<v Speaker 3>George Saint Pierre learned how to wrestle,</v>

2350
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.930
<v Speaker 3>never wrestled in high school,</v>

2351
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.010
<v Speaker 3>never rested on college,</v>

2352
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 3>but became one of the best wrestlers in MMA.</v>

2353
01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the reason why</v>

2354
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I remember I wrestled a bear this in the 70s,</v>

2355
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 2>arrested in the Montreal open wrestling tournament.</v>

2356
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:25.913
<v Speaker 2>And this is just a,</v>

2357
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 2>at that time when the Russians were making a big influx in,</v>

2358
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:29.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2359
01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:34.771
<v Speaker 2>they were starting to charge to a defect and flee to the Western world,</v>

2360
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union,</v>

2361
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>it was still existed.</v>

2362
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And I remember our wrestled Victor Silberman in the finals and got my ass handed</v>

2363
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:42.311
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2364
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2365
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I was trying to talk to him later because I was really impressed with</v>

2366
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:46.421
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

2367
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>his technique and his skill and everything.</v>

2368
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2369
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2370
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I was utterly shocked when he told me the only lifted weights once a week.</v>

2371
01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>He lifted weights four times a month.</v>

2372
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>And at that,</v>

2373
01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:57.850
<v Speaker 2>how is that even possible?</v>

2374
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I thought these Russian guys like lifted weights every day,</v>

2375
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:01.803
<v Speaker 2>twice a day.</v>

2376
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

2377
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:02.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2378
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:02.831
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2379
01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:02.951
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2380
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2381
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>We practice technical wrestling is the base of our training.</v>

2382
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 2>And then I was utterly shocked.</v>

2383
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2384
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.081
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

2385
01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:11.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2386
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.720
<v Speaker 2>a guy that was trained with me in Philly for a while.</v>

2387
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.780
<v Speaker 2>It's five times the Ukrainian national wrestling champion.</v>

2388
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.030
<v Speaker 2>You used to be on the national team.</v>

2389
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 2>This was back when the Ukraine and Russia is all part of the Soviet Union and he</v>

2390
01:06:23.471 --> 01:06:24.181
<v Speaker 2>was telling me that,</v>

2391
01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2392
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.080
<v Speaker 2>they would only spar really hardly twice a week because they found that the live</v>

2393
01:06:29.081 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 2>wrestling was what was producing all the injuries.</v>

2394
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.220
<v Speaker 2>But when they would train,</v>

2395
01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 2>they would train like real slow motion and they be gradually built their speed</v>

2396
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>to the point where they were just going all out horn and they would just do this</v>

2397
01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.360
<v Speaker 2>for long periods of time and wow.</v>

2398
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It is unbelievably hard workout when you're shooting high crotch singles,</v>

2399
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>doubles and so forth at match speed over and over and over and over.</v>

2400
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:54.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like Holy Shit.</v>

2401
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 2>And that was their main cardio.</v>

2402
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It takes real discipline to that discipline,</v>

2403
01:06:58.811 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2404
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Most people that's in Jujitsu as well.</v>

2405
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's very similar.</v>

2406
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of your sentence want to roll,</v>

2407
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 2>just want to roll.</v>

2408
01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go over drills,</v>

2409
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 2>but they never get technical.</v>

2410
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.330
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

2411
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.170
<v Speaker 2>That is the problem.</v>

2412
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Drills or where you really learn how to have those movements become a part of</v>

2414
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:14.290
<v Speaker 2>your nervous system.</v>

2415
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.070
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>

2416
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:16.900
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2418
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.201
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2419
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 2>and keeping the sparring limited,</v>

2420
01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:19.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2421
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.340
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2422
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't get your muscles and joints is stressed and you don't get the</v>

2423
01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>

2424
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.840
<v Speaker 2>But I was very surprised to hear that,</v>

2425
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:26.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2426
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:26.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2427
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 2>cause I had a complete different,</v>

2428
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2429
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.580
<v Speaker 2>perception because American wrestling,</v>

2430
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 2>he just basically pounding each other every time you go into the wrestling room,</v>

2431
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:35.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2432
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:35.904
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2433
01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:36.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2434
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.613
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2435
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 2>That is the problem with,</v>

2436
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2437
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.131
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2438
01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:44.070
<v Speaker 2>do the American produce amazingly tough wrestlers of course.</v>

2439
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 2>But the reason I think why we're not seeing,</v>

2440
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2441
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Americans dominating the international scene anymore,</v>

2442
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's no damn money at it,</v>

2443
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:52.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2444
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2445
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.471
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2446
01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you graduate from college and you know,</v>

2447
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have a degree or whatever,</v>

2448
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>but what are you going to do with your wrestling skills?</v>

2449
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>

2450
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>the UFC opened up a whole new,</v>

2451
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2452
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.600
<v Speaker 2>a whole new door for former NCAA wrestlers.</v>

2453
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell would he go and go to the Olympics and make peanuts when you can</v>

2454
01:08:12.551 --> 01:08:14.590
<v Speaker 2>make fairly decent money?</v>

2455
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Possibly if you're good,</v>

2456
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

2457
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2458
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:16.941
<v Speaker 3>if you're tough.</v>

2459
01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:17.774
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2460
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2461
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>that's what I wanted to know.</v>

2462
01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Do the Russians have that same issue with overtraining during the no.</v>

2463
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:24.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2464
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>because they don't spar.</v>

2465
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.073
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2466
01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:27.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2467
01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 3>as much as the Americans do that,</v>

2468
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:31.340
<v Speaker 3>they are very careful not to over train as they,</v>

2469
01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2470
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:31.941
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2471
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:32.350
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2472
01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 3>they have like blocks where they kind of,</v>

2473
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2474
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>they kind of amp ramp up the training as they get near a narrow like world</v>

2475
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 3>championships or the Olympics or whatever.</v>

2476
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Some people call it periodization or whatever,</v>

2477
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:43.280
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2478
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 3>they're very careful not to overtrain and over overdo it.</v>

2479
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:47.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2480
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:47.931
<v Speaker 3>how come?</v>

2481
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2482
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 3>they're known for their mental toughness as well.</v>

2483
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Like why does,</v>

2484
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.230
<v Speaker 3>why don't the American wrestlers incorporate that into their workouts?</v>

2485
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Or have they started to do,</v>

2486
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 3>they probably are,</v>

2487
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:56.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2488
01:08:56.781 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I've lost a little bit of touch with the wrestling community,</v>

2489
01:08:59.331 --> 01:08:59.931
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2490
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:01.760
<v Speaker 3>our wrestling coaches are fantastic.</v>

2491
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:01.941
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2492
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:03.010
<v Speaker 3>the smart guy.</v>

2493
01:09:03.011 --> 01:09:06.830
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure they're taking a hard look because the Russians have been really</v>

2494
01:09:06.831 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>successful as have the Iranians as the Turks,</v>

2495
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 3>the Bulgarians,</v>

2496
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:11.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:15.410
<v Speaker 3>all of these countries that perennially put out like world champions,</v>

2498
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Azerbaijan,</v>

2499
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:17.354
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2500
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2501
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 3>the Mongolians are really starting to dominate a judo and they,</v>

2502
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:21.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2503
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 3>they've always been tough as shit and wrestling.</v>

2504
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>

2505
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2506
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.200
<v Speaker 3>for sure you can learn a lot from their,</v>

2507
01:09:28.201 --> 01:09:30.680
<v Speaker 3>their basic programs that are pretty simple programs really.</v>

2508
01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:31.431
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2509
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:31.731
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2510
01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:32.001
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2511
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.820
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a lot of sophisticated equipment and so forth,</v>

2512
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.280
<v Speaker 3>but what they meant,</v>

2513
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.010
<v Speaker 3>they make up,</v>

2514
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:42.010
<v Speaker 3>they make up for a lack of sophistication with equipment and facilities and all</v>

2515
01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.910
<v Speaker 3>that with technique.</v>

2516
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 3>They're real technicians.</v>

2517
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 3>That is the most important part of any martial art.</v>

2518
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:53.270
<v Speaker 3>The most important part is having that technique down to just a razor sharpness</v>

2519
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 3>or razor sharpness.</v>

2520
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:54.591
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2521
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 3>You've got to hone those skills because you know,</v>

2522
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 3>a MMA,</v>

2523
01:09:58.101 --> 01:09:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Jiu Jitsu,</v>

2524
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.601
<v Speaker 3>judo,</v>

2525
01:09:59.601 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>

2526
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.093
<v Speaker 3>it's all technique.</v>

2527
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I really wish you'd watch this past weekend,</v>

2528
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.420
<v Speaker 3>this UFC because a man,</v>

2529
01:10:06.421 --> 01:10:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to catch it on the replay now.</v>

2530
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 3>You got to watch Anthony Pettis versus Hofeld dos Anjos there must have been</v>

2531
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 3>hell of a match.</v>

2532
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

2533
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Dos Anjos beat the brakes off of the Internet yet.</v>

2534
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:18.561
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2535
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 3>How long did they wait to before they were loaded it up?</v>

2536
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2537
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 3>what site do you go to to,</v>

2538
01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>

2539
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:24.283
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

2540
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.071
<v Speaker 3>fight pass.</v>

2541
01:10:25.071 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>UFC fight pass.</v>

2542
01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2544
01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2545
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it's up yet.</v>

2546
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.451
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2547
01:10:28.451 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And I'll check.</v>

2548
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:29.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is.</v>

2549
01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:30.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2550
01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what's on paper view.</v>

2551
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:32.770
<v Speaker 3>It might be available on fight pass.</v>

2552
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2553
01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2554
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I was just curious how long,</v>

2555
01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:34.831
<v Speaker 3>but I'll,</v>

2556
01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:35.211
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

2557
01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:36.200

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.820
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how,</v>

2561
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I think they do show some pay per views.</v>

2562
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>They have live events.</v>

2563
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2564

<v Speaker 3>I'll try to find it.</v>

2570
01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 3>We'll see if we could find some highlights of it.</v>

2571
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:53.871
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2572

<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable.</v>

2587
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:19.941
<v Speaker 1>And he got Diego Sanchez and did probably the best shape of his life when Diego,</v>

2588
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2589
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>challenged Bj Penn for the belt and Diego wound up getting beaten pretty badly</v>

2590
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>by Bj when PJ was in his prime BJ's like an all time great.</v>

2591
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just,</v>

2592
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2593
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>one of my all time favorite fighters,</v>

2594
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but he was in incredible shape for this fight as well,</v>

2595
01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>which was always like kind of his Achilles heel was his,</v>

2596
01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2597
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>he was so talented,</v>

2598
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but he just never really</v>

2599
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>was able to continue that sort of strength and conditioning program that got</v>

2600
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>them into the shape that he was when he fought Diego Sanchez.</v>

2601
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And what we were talking about with Steve,</v>

2602
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2603
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:58.590
<v Speaker 1>being that the technique is so important,</v>

2604
01:11:58.591 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 1>it is so incredibly important,</v>

2605
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but MMA is so unbelievably grueling.</v>

2606
01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with shale sign about it who's a former UFC fighter and</v>

2608
01:12:08.421 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 1>he's fought for the title several times,</v>

2609
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Speaker 1>a great fighter and also a very open guy,</v>

2610
01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:19.851
<v Speaker 1>very open as far as like his own limitations and his strengths and weaknesses.</v>

2611
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And he was just talking about how the time that you spend inside the octagon,</v>

2612
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the competing for 25 minutes is almost impossible to really do.</v>

2613
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It's almost too much time.</v>

2614
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2615
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying was that Steve's back what I was saying,</v>

2616
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 1>that the amount of time that you spend in the octagon fighting in a championship</v>

2617
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:43.710
<v Speaker 1>fight is so insane.</v>

2618
01:12:43.711 --> 01:12:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost like you're sprinting for 25 minutes.</v>

2619
01:12:46.371 --> 01:12:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal.</v>

2620
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And very few people figure out how to get in the right shape as well as work</v>

2621
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 1>their skills.</v>

2622
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And there's that weird</v>

2623
01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.260
<v Speaker 2>man because like endurance is a skill,</v>

2624
01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.300
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also the skill of making the other guy use up his energy more</v>

2625
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:06.343
<v Speaker 2>than yourself.</v>

2626
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that.</v>

2627
01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:09.201
<v Speaker 2>Enter the,</v>

2628
01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:09.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2629
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:10.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2630
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>controlling and,</v>

2631
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and managing your energy system and the rang and on the mat as such a skill unto</v>

2632
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:18.854
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2633
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2634
01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.000
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2635
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.510
<v Speaker 2>let's just take out the striking skills and the grappling skills and all that</v>

2636
01:13:23.511 --> 01:13:24.230
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2637
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Just that energy management,</v>

2638
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:27.440
<v Speaker 2>that's huge man.</v>

2639
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of guys don't pay enough attention to it.</v>

2640
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:30.391
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2641
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:30.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2642
01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:30.960
<v Speaker 2>dealing</v>

2643
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.180
<v Speaker 1>with pressure is a big one.</v>

2644
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember from my days of competing that when guys like really aggressive and I</v>

2645
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>was backing up a lot of trying to move away,</v>

2646
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd get so much more tired because you're always thinking,</v>

2647
01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:42.861
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>

2648
01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with this guy attacking you and you're backing up,</v>

2649
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:47.220
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of an unnatural movement.</v>

2650
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people run,</v>

2651
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but very few people run backwards and you've got to realize that when you're</v>

2652
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>going backwards,</v>

2653
01:13:53.071 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of using your muscles in a different way is different.</v>

2654
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:57.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And very few people do like Muhammad Ali's to run miles backwards because he was</v>

2656
01:14:02.821 --> 01:14:05.040
<v Speaker 1>always backing up and then moving forward,</v>

2657
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.210
<v Speaker 1>backing up and moving forward.</v>

2658
01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most beautiful things about him when you watch him,</v>

2659
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.960
<v Speaker 1>like in his prime,</v>

2660
01:14:09.961 --> 01:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>like the Cleveland Big Cat Williams days before,</v>

2661
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2662
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>they took his title the way because he didn't want to fight in the Vietnam War.</v>

2663
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:21.090
<v Speaker 1>His footwork and movement was just magical and his ability to back up and be you</v>

2664
01:14:21.121 --> 01:14:21.221
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

2665
01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you really couldn't catch him.</v>

2666
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>He was just backing up and moving forward,</v>

2667
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>backing up and moving forward.</v>

2668
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's something he had to work at really hard.</v>

2669
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:34.111
<v Speaker 1>But three minutes in a boxing match is so much different than five minutes with</v>

2670
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and leg kicks and elbows and the clench and God,</v>

2671
01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the,</v>

2672
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

2673
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to see what you think after you watch this fight because one of the</v>

2674
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:48.340
<v Speaker 1>most impressive things about the fight as far as dos Anjos performance was his</v>

2675
01:14:48.341 --> 01:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>cardio was insane.</v>

2676
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 1>There's just like something else,</v>

2677
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2678
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:53.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2679
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>he just attacked from the moment the,</v>

2680
01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the fight started.</v>

2681
01:14:57.491 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 1>He just went after us and just never let up.</v>

2682
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Like literally never went up,</v>

2683
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:02.951
<v Speaker 1>let up.</v>

2684
01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

2685
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It really was amazing.</v>

2686
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.161
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>

2687
01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:07.750
<v Speaker 1>here's a maybe a sore point,</v>

2688
01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2689
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.110
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think about the,</v>

2690
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 1>the use of the,</v>

2691
01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:13.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2692
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing like stimulants took mask fatigue and so forth,</v>

2693
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:18.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2694
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.180
<v Speaker 1>which kinds you can do in another sales,</v>

2695
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:21.750
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

2696
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 1>many different ones these days.</v>

2697
01:15:23.711 --> 01:15:24.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious,</v>

2698
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:25.990
<v Speaker 1>how are they testing for this stuff now?</v>

2699
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.891
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2700
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:27.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2701
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:27.641
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>

2702
01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:28.920
<v Speaker 1>are these guys using like,</v>

2703
01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2704
01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2705
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:35.130
<v Speaker 1>various stimulants to keep them like really pretty much hopped up while they're</v>

2706
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 1>protesting for everything?</v>

2707
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

2708
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 1>So guys are getting popped for a lot of different stuff.</v>

2709
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2710
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Hector lumbar discussed this district strict testing now,</v>

2711
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.800
<v Speaker 1>especially California.</v>

2712
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've given this guy credit but I give him credit again.</v>

2713
01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Andy fosters been the director of the California State Athletic Commission for a</v>

2714
01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:53.020
<v Speaker 1>few think a couple of years now.</v>

2715
01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:54.040
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2716
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a former fighter,</v>

2717
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 1>longtime martial artist and he's very smart,</v>

2718
01:15:58.061 --> 01:15:59.220
<v Speaker 1>very diligent about this.</v>

2719
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.053
<v Speaker 1>And I've had some,</v>

2720
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with them when the UFC was in Los Angeles and uh,</v>

2721
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he said,</v>

2722
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:05.981
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2723
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:06.341
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2724
01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>we're going to test everybody tonight.</v>

2725
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.580
<v Speaker 1>We're not just testing the,</v>

2726
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the guys in the main event.</v>

2727
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>We're not just testing,</v>

2728
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2729
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:12.511
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2730
01:16:12.511 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the people that are involved in the paper view,</v>

2731
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>we're testing everyone that competes tonight,</v>

2732
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 1>blood and urine.</v>

2733
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You're in before the fight,</v>

2734
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>blood after the fantastic.</v>

2735
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

2736
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's so cute.</v>

2737
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I wish they'd do that for a regular Jujitsu.</v>

2738
01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Although it's probably cost prohibitive.</v>

2739
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very cost prohibitive.</v>

2740
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like $40,000.</v>

2741
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:30.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2742
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:31.690
<v Speaker 1>depending on what lab you go to,</v>

2743
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the results vary or the price varies,</v>

2744
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:35.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2745
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2746
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.280
<v Speaker 1>at least the place winners,</v>

2747
01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you know the first uh,</v>

2748
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah [inaudible] on the podium.</v>

2749
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He needs to have to be tested,</v>

2750
01:16:40.571 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2751
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2752
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:41.884
<v Speaker 1>for Jujitsu,</v>

2753
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu does have a real epidemic in it.</v>

2754
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:44.591
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2755
01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a real issue.</v>

2756
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately a lot of Jujitsu guys that have come over to MMA of pissed hot</v>

2757
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:50.343
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2758
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2759
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what's a good strength is so it's such a critical factor in,</v>

2760
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.300
<v Speaker 1>in forcing positions,</v>

2761
01:16:56.301 --> 01:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2762
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean the technique is everything for sure.</v>

2763
01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:00.520
<v Speaker 1>But strength endurance ma'am,</v>

2764
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>it's God damn huge.</v>

2765
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And there's some guys,</v>

2766
01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:03.251
<v Speaker 1>we all know,</v>

2767
01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 1>some guys you try to hit singles on them,</v>

2768
01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>you try to like try to do an arm drag and it's like trying to pull a wall.</v>

2769
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 1>You some dude's like,</v>

2770
01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:11.991
<v Speaker 1>look at who some are.</v>

2771
01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Paul Horace is a perfect example.</v>

2772
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>That damn dude is so strong.</v>

2773
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He's so ridiculously strong.</v>

2774
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>You see guys like John Fitch tangled up with them and John Fetches in elite</v>

2775
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:26.900
<v Speaker 1>wrestler elite took him down and cranked on his leg in the first round.</v>

2776
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2777
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 1>John Never got out of the round.</v>

2778
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:28.940
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't,</v>

2779
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get out of the round.</v>

2780
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>All of sudden he's leg locked and just didn't know what to do and got his,</v>

2781
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 1>got his leg hyper extended.</v>

2782
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>But these um,</v>

2783
01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2784
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:37.760
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs,</v>

2785
01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 1>they're catching guys for some of them I've never even heard of.</v>

2786
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:40.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2787
01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 1>they're getting so sophisticated and stuff now there's so many new cocktails</v>

2788
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:50.830
<v Speaker 1>that fall kind of just within the borders of legality,</v>

2789
01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2790
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what paper always discovering some new way to hop up or,</v>

2791
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2792
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:57.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2793
01:17:57.331 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I was just curious about your take,</v>

2794
01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2795
01:17:59.031 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 1>because you're around these guys all the time,</v>

2796
01:18:00.471 --> 01:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2797
01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2798
01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of guys that are taking things,</v>

2799
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2800
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.560
<v Speaker 1>when they don't think they're going to get tested,</v>

2801
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:07.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2802
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:10.550
<v Speaker 1>when they need to for the training and just to get through it.</v>

2803
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2804
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:13.000
<v Speaker 1>The training and also to recover from injury.</v>

2805
01:18:13.001 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big one.</v>

2806
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>And not just injuries that you know about like surgeries,</v>

2807
01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but almost everybody is tweaked.</v>

2808
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.830
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a bum knee or your elbow is bothering you or something's going</v>

2809
01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:22.664
<v Speaker 1>on with your neck.</v>

2810
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

2811
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.410
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no way of avoiding.</v>

2812
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2813
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2814
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:26.661
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2815
01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:31.661
<v Speaker 1>You cannot engage in an extremist sport like MMA and maybe to a lesser extent at</v>

2816
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and judo and wrestling at that competitive level without the tweaks.</v>

2817
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:39.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:18:39.951 --> 01:18:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a way impossible.</v>

2819
01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 1>You cannot do a combat sport without paying the price to the,</v>

2820
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 1>to the body,</v>

2821
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.090
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if a protocol will eventually be a stab.</v>

2822
01:18:50.091 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I was like the most intelligent protocol,</v>

2823
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:56.590
<v Speaker 1>similar to what you're getting with these Russians that are there,</v>

2824
01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.890
<v Speaker 1>that are developing,</v>

2825
01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:02.810
<v Speaker 1>they've developed this program for wrestling where they're just doing a lot of</v>

2826
01:19:02.811 --> 01:19:03.740
<v Speaker 1>technical training,</v>

2827
01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:05.540
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as much sparring,</v>

2828
01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:07.010
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of technique,</v>

2829
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of repetition and drills.</v>

2830
01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that will slowly work its way into MMA and be established as this is</v>

2831
01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:17.060
<v Speaker 1>the way to do it,</v>

2832
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:18.051
<v Speaker 1>the way they're doing it.</v>

2833
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:18.884
<v Speaker 1>Saying Russia.</v>

2834
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:19.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2835
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2836
01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2837
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to have to at some point because you know,</v>

2838
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>the career window for a lot of these guys right now is like,</v>

2839
01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:27.441
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>

2840
01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 1>like two years maybe.</v>

2841
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2842
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.960
<v Speaker 1>nine years seems to be the magic number for everybody that seems like that,</v>

2843
01:19:35.501 --> 01:19:35.691
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2844
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2845
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But don't you see a lot of these guys pretty much burning out within about a two</v>

2846
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:40.761
<v Speaker 1>and a half,</v>

2847
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:41.271
<v Speaker 1>three years?</v>

2848
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's a Lotta guys that flare to the top and then they're gone.</v>

2849
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2850
01:19:47.301 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>There's also the issue with their,</v>

2851
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:51.170
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of forced to keep competing on a regular basis.</v>

2852
01:19:51.171 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Once they become successful,</v>

2853
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.420
<v Speaker 1>especially you break into the top 10 and you want to keep competing and winning.</v>

2854
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you win a big fight and say,</v>

2855
01:19:59.211 --> 01:19:59.571
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2856
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 1>we're with the UFC calls you up on Monday,</v>

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd really love to,</v>

2870
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:09.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 3>whatever issues you have.</v>

2876
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 3>And oftentimes that's not an option.</v>

2877
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:21.480
<v Speaker 3>They have to go right back into training camp and these injuries become chronic</v>

2878
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>and it's a brutal way to make it live in man.</v>

2879
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:25.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a very brutal way to make a living.</v>

2880
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:26.244
<v Speaker 3>And some guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know how Randy coture did it.</v>

2882
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either.</v>

2883
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.830
<v Speaker 3>He got through and it was late forties would no surgeries.</v>

2884
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Of course he was an anomaly.</v>

2885
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

2886

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was like,</v>

2889
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:37.344
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2890
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean one out of thousands and thousands,</v>

2891
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:41.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2892
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:42.860
<v Speaker 3>you just don't find guys like him.</v>

2893
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:43.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2894
01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the hell he did it.</v>

2895
01:20:44.701 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2896
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 3>I really have no idea.</v>

2897

2899
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he's suffering now at all.</v>

2900
01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Do you know him personally?</v>

2901
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I do know him personally,</v>

2902
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:52.380
<v Speaker 3>but he seems fine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he seems fine,</v>

2934
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 3>but the point being that they asked him questions about Laila Ali,</v>

2935
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:26.161

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:39.810
<v Speaker 3>the Great Dan Gable,</v>

2951
01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.760
<v Speaker 3>like one of the greatest wrestlers,</v>

2952
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.800
<v Speaker 3>not just in America,</v>

2953
01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 3>but the world has ever produced,</v>

2954
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 3>man is a man,</v>

2955
01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:48.030
<v Speaker 3>and he went through the,</v>

2956
01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:49.920
<v Speaker 3>the Munich Olympics.</v>

2957
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:50.701

01:21:54.301 --> 01:21:54.751
<v Speaker 3>Was that money?</v>

2961

2963
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.013
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

2964
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 3>It was the Munich Olympics.</v>

2965
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:02.710
<v Speaker 3>It was that,</v>

2966
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.770
<v Speaker 3>it was soul right.</v>

2967
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Where they had that tragic.</v>

2968
01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2969
01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:06.711
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2970
01:22:06.711 --> 01:22:06.920
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2971
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.381
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2972
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2973
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:08.663
<v Speaker 3>the terrorists,</v>

2974
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:09.810
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

2975
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.160
<v Speaker 3>he walked through that tournament.</v>

2976
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm scored on how is that even possible at the elite level,</v>

2977
01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:17.730
<v Speaker 3>not to be scored on incredible Jesus.</v>

2978
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.833
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2979
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:19.853
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2980
01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone's ever done it before.</v>

2981
01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:22.951
<v Speaker 3>Since now.</v>

2982
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>He was an Uber dedicated monster honoring God,</v>

2983
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2984
01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.690
<v Speaker 3>But wow.</v>

2985
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Double hip replacement.</v>

2986
01:22:29.281 --> 01:22:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether he's had knee replacement,</v>

2987
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>but I saw a video of the poor guy,</v>

2988
01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:33.210
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2989
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:33.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2990
01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:34.314
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2991
01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I suppose if you'd ask him,</v>

2992
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:36.350
<v Speaker 3>was it worth it?</v>

2993
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.901
<v Speaker 3>He'd probably say,</v>

2994
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>hell yeah,</v>

2995
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:38.341
<v Speaker 3>you mount the Cory.</v>

2996
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:39.720
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2997
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 3>his mind is fine.</v>

2998
01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.050
<v Speaker 3>It just looks like he's in such utter pain the way shuffles and,</v>

2999
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 3>and move it around.</v>

3000
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:51.620
<v Speaker 3>He just beat himself to death basically with those crazy marathon training.</v>

3001
01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the problems with the other young guys.</v>

3002
01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:58.200
<v Speaker 3>He was the role model for a lot of us young guys coming up.</v>

3003
01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3004
01:23:00.031 --> 01:23:01.020
<v Speaker 3>that that approach,</v>

3005
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 3>that kamikaze approach to training,</v>

3006
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.770
<v Speaker 3>it really ages the body.</v>

3007
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3008
01:23:05.261 --> 01:23:05.861
<v Speaker 3>it really does.</v>

3009
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.030
<v Speaker 3>When you're in your 20s,</v>

3010
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:09.190
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing the big picture man.</v>

3011
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:09.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3012
01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 3>you gotta live with that body for,</v>

3013
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3014
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 3>a good number of years after you hang up your wrestling shoes.</v>

3015
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3016
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think what you said,</v>

3017
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 3>like if you asked him,</v>

3018
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 3>he probably would say it was worth it because he,</v>

3019
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't take away history.</v>

3020
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:23.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3021
01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:27.300
<v Speaker 3>that guy has amazing memories of being one of the greatest wrestlers ever.</v>

3022
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 3>But his mind is okay,</v>

3023
01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:29.891
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>

3024
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:30.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 3>He's a very intelligent guy,</v>

3026
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have dementia or anything that you've sent in wrestling.</v>

3027
01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:36.274
<v Speaker 3>You're not taking that,</v>

3028
01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:36.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3029
01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3030
01:23:37.031 --> 01:23:37.151
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3031
01:23:37.151 --> 01:23:38.020
<v Speaker 3>the brain trauma.</v>

3032
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3033
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Mark Coleman first ever UFC heavyweight champion.</v>

3034
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.500
<v Speaker 3>His body is starting to fail him.</v>

3035
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.540
<v Speaker 3>He had one hip replacement and apparently they have to replace it again.</v>

3036
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 3>He had a massive infection when they went in to look at it and he's in the</v>

3037
01:23:51.251 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 3>hospital now and there's a go fund me.</v>

3038
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3039
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

3040
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll retweet the link later today after this podcast is all are for folks who</v>

3041
01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:59.320
<v Speaker 3>want to help out mark.</v>

3042
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.041
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3043
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3044
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:00.971
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3045
01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:01.804
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3046
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3047
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:02.740
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

3048
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 3>his body is just all banged up from the years of wrestling,</v>

3049
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:07.330
<v Speaker 3>high level wrestler.</v>

3050
01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.470
<v Speaker 3>And then from there all the years of competing in MMA,</v>

3051
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.861
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3052
01:24:11.861 --> 01:24:13.300
<v Speaker 3>he's getting his hip replaced.</v>

3053
01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Two is I believe both of them need to be replaced.</v>

3054
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:20.080
<v Speaker 3>So that brings us back then full circle to where we started with the,</v>

3055
01:24:20.081 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3056
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:20.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3057
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.514
<v Speaker 3>just to,</v>

3058
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 3>for a lifetime.</v>

3059
01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe there is a way that you can train and have a lot of fun with</v>

3060
01:24:26.501 --> 01:24:27.334
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

3061
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 3>but you got to keep it really light.</v>

3062
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:29.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3063
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

3064
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.791
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3065
01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:31.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3066
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3067
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 3>the grandson's Abelia Gracie,</v>

3068
01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 3>keep it playful,</v>

3069
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:36.580
<v Speaker 3>keep it fun,</v>

3070
01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.490
<v Speaker 3>don't be so concerned about points.</v>

3071
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:39.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3072
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:43.320
<v Speaker 3>some guys will bleed from the eyes not to have the guard pass.</v>

3073
01:24:43.321 --> 01:24:43.661
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3074
01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:44.110
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3075
01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not even a tournament.</v>

3076
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:48.280
<v Speaker 3>And you're getting cranked up in your neck and,</v>

3077
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3078
01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:49.061
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3079
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:49.391
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3080
01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:52.360
<v Speaker 3>and you're taking all this abuse for what?</v>

3081
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3082
01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.210
<v Speaker 3>But you got to be passed and then work on reclaiming,</v>

3083
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 3>reclaiming guard and just get good at the fence.</v>

3084
01:24:58.601 --> 01:24:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>

3085
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.820
<v Speaker 3>like a Master Leo,</v>

3086
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3087
01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:03.060
<v Speaker 3>he was a master at defense man.</v>

3088
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't do anything to the old man.</v>

3089
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things in Hixson always preaches.</v>

3090
01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Like defense is the most important thing.</v>

3091
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Most important thing is defense.</v>

3092
01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Be Safe,</v>

3093
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.170
<v Speaker 3>basically safe and,</v>

3094
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:16.810
<v Speaker 3>and I think he can extend your grappling career wound to advanced stage.</v>

3095
01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I think of all the martial arts,</v>

3096
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 3>you can pretty much do Jujitsu and submission.</v>

3097
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling if you're,</v>

3098
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:25.054
<v Speaker 3>if you're smart,</v>

3099
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:26.890
<v Speaker 3>well under advanced age,</v>

3100
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 3>unlike a lot of other things.</v>

3101
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:29.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3102
01:25:29.021 --> 01:25:32.350
<v Speaker 3>it's ironic that you say that because Hixon himself is very banged up,</v>

3103
01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 3>like really badly banged up.</v>

3104
01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:35.500
<v Speaker 3>He has eight herniated discs.</v>

3105
01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:36.221
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

3106
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3107
01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of muscle atrophy.</v>

3108
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:38.261
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3109
01:25:38.261 --> 01:25:39.001
<v Speaker 3>if you look at his body,</v>

3110
01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:39.701
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of,</v>

3111
01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:42.430
<v Speaker 3>a lot of pain and suffering and uh,</v>

3112
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:45.580
<v Speaker 3>he talked about it pretty openly when it was on the podcast and then afterwards</v>

3113
01:25:45.581 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 3>we discussed it.</v>

3114
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3115
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.300
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't look physically anything like he looked like back when he fought</v>

3116
01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:52.083
<v Speaker 3>quite a specimen.</v>

3117
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:52.601
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3118
01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:52.811
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3119
01:25:52.811 --> 01:25:54.730
<v Speaker 3>it was 200 plus pounds.</v>

3120
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Very thick muscled and just flexible.</v>

3121
01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And his movement was amazing,</v>

3122
01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:04.201
<v Speaker 3>but all those years of getting cranked and also constantly training constantly</v>

3123
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 3>in their car and being slammed a lot.</v>

3124
01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:09.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3125
01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3126
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:10.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3127
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you can see in some of the old videos where he's getting smashed down to the</v>

3128
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:16.154
<v Speaker 3>ground pretty hard.</v>

3129
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:17.600
<v Speaker 3>That Zillow fight.</v>

3130
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3131
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.450
<v Speaker 3>It was basically thrown himself backwards and the top up and,</v>

3132
01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:21.710
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's a big heavy guy.</v>

3133
01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that wasn't just that.</v>

3134
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like you said,</v>

3135
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 3>it's the training for that stuff.</v>

3136
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3137
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:32.980
<v Speaker 3>It's ironic when you think about him being one of the masters and one of the</v>

3138
01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 3>real originators of that whole breathing system,</v>

3139
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:35.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3140
01:26:35.901 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 3>he brought that yoga breathing,</v>

3141
01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:39.360
<v Speaker 3>that fire breathing to,</v>

3142
01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3143
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.240
<v Speaker 3>to the practice of Jujitsu.</v>

3144
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:44.060
<v Speaker 3>And here he's all just really banged up.</v>

3145
01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 3>You really can't train anymore.</v>

3146
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:45.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3147
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 3>he kinda like goes over a technique and I think maybe he does some really,</v>

3148
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:51.290
<v Speaker 3>really light rolling with people he knows perhaps.</v>

3149
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:53.720
<v Speaker 3>But when it happens to everyone eventually,</v>

3150
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:54.470
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3151
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm very picky myself now.</v>

3152
01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my sixties it's like a Nixon's 10 years younger than you.</v>

3153
01:26:59.380 --> 01:26:59.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3154
01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:00.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3155
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.160
<v Speaker 3>And probably the consensus all time.</v>

3156
01:27:04.161 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3157
01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.151
<v Speaker 3>All time.</v>

3158
01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3159
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:05.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3160
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:06.800
<v Speaker 3>If you ask people like,</v>

3161
01:27:06.801 --> 01:27:08.810
<v Speaker 3>who's the best Jujitsu and you know,</v>

3162
01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3163
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy that tap Mark Schultz.</v>

3164
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I asked him about that on the podcast a,</v>

3165
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.000
<v Speaker 3>him and Mark Schultz,</v>

3166
01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:17.270
<v Speaker 3>like Mark Schultz had never really rolled with the Jujitsu black belt before.</v>

3167
01:27:17.271 --> 01:27:19.450
<v Speaker 3>And he said the guy was incredible grappler,</v>

3168
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 3>incredible coppler but Hixon caught him like in like 30 seconds with a triangle.</v>

3169
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Like you just had no idea what it was.</v>

3170
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:26.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3171
01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:28.610
<v Speaker 3>he really didn't know what he was doing as most wrestlers,</v>

3172
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:31.460
<v Speaker 3>especially at the time.</v>

3173
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Most wrestlers now I would imagine it like six months.</v>

3174
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3175
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3176
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Well being,</v>

3177
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that mark was,</v>

3178
01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm disqualified for him.</v>

3179
01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:42.800
<v Speaker 3>One of his key matches was he,</v>

3180
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3181
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:46.310
<v Speaker 3>got a guy in that Komora and used it to,</v>

3182
01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3183
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 3>used it in a way that's illegal and wrestling and he would use it all the time</v>

3184
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:52.341
<v Speaker 3>like that and MMA.</v>

3185
01:27:52.341 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 3>But he locked it up and rolled the guy within,</v>

3186
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 3>just ripped his shoulder apart.</v>

3187
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Ouch.</v>

3188
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the guy was from Turkey.</v>

3189
01:27:59.240 --> 01:27:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3190
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.141
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>

3191
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:00.891
<v Speaker 3>pull up the video,</v>

3192
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.240
<v Speaker 3>see Mark Schultz,</v>

3193
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:04.220
<v Speaker 3>disqualified wrestling,</v>

3194
01:28:04.221 --> 01:28:06.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's a classic,</v>

3195
01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:07.310
<v Speaker 3>a double risk lock.</v>

3196
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't catch wrestling,</v>

3197
01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:09.104
<v Speaker 3>double risk.</v>

3198
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 3>And he uses it to flip the guy over and just destroys his arm in the process.</v>

3199
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:18.780
<v Speaker 3>And he went on to learn a lot of submission techniques.</v>

3200
01:28:18.970 --> 01:28:23.430
<v Speaker 3>The guy was an absolute frightening animal towards then resonate after he</v>

3201
01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:24.460
<v Speaker 3>learned this as emissions.</v>

3202
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.270
<v Speaker 3>So physically strong too.</v>

3203
01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the early catches catch can wrestling submissions were all part of</v>

3204
01:28:30.831 --> 01:28:31.490
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3205
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading this fascinating book.</v>

3206
01:28:32.781 --> 01:28:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Let me get the exact title here.</v>

3207
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3208
01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.353
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3209
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.560
<v Speaker 3>right now one of it's the history of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and this guy did an</v>

3210
01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:43.050
<v Speaker 3>amazing job.</v>

3211
01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting this,</v>

3212
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:47.030
<v Speaker 3>putting this thing together.</v>

3213
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:48.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3214
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.124
<v Speaker 3>I don't have it here.</v>

3215
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called a,</v>

3216
01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.640
<v Speaker 3>so he's a thing.</v>

3217
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:54.830
<v Speaker 3>He gets the guys trying to get a single,</v>

3218
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:57.410
<v Speaker 3>so he's got his legs in between.</v>

3219
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3220
01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 3>he's got Schultz leg in between his legs.</v>

3221
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Schultes locks up,</v>

3222
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:05.760
<v Speaker 3>double wrist lock and drops and rows and just destroys his arm.</v>

3223
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Just destroys it.</v>

3224
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.820
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

3225
01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I,</v>

3226
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I saw Kimora on one is old black and white pre World War II.</v>

3227
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Juno videos do the same exact take down with the gate.</v>

3228
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3229
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:25.190
<v Speaker 3>He locked up the Camorra the same exact way and throw the guy you want me to say</v>

3230
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 3>that one more time?</v>

3231
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I love watching that.</v>

3232
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely brutal,</v>

3233
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:28.201
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>

3234
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3235
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:29.820
<v Speaker 3>He was his qualify for that.</v>

3236
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3237
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I believe so.</v>

3238
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure once I does this crank,</v>

3239
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:38.180
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder's gone to the guy.</v>

3240
01:29:38.181 --> 01:29:40.500
<v Speaker 3>You could just see the guy that he just collapsed.</v>

3241
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:45.450
<v Speaker 3>And I get how that's a very similar to when a Frank Mir Brookman the Toros arm.</v>

3242
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3243
01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3244
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.633
<v Speaker 3>I remember that man.</v>

3245
01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>

3246
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 3>they want to tap and heads got his arm broken by Sakharova.</v>

3247
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3248
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:54.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3249
01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Sakuraba is almost the same type of situation where it was a standing Kimora and</v>

3250
01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:02.190
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to throw him and I think Hanzo resisted by straighten the arm,</v>

3251
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 3>but it was enough torque that it,</v>

3252
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:04.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3253
01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.050
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3254
01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 3>it popped.</v>

3255
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.310
<v Speaker 3>I believe Hanzo had his back and just got a little relaxed because I think Kenzo</v>

3256
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.310
<v Speaker 3>was winning the fight.</v>

3257
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:12.411
<v Speaker 3>Henzel had soccer,</v>

3258
01:30:12.411 --> 01:30:13.320
<v Speaker 3>rob is back and you know,</v>

3259
01:30:13.321 --> 01:30:13.831
<v Speaker 3>soccer rob,</v>

3260
01:30:13.831 --> 01:30:14.551
<v Speaker 3>when he had his back,</v>

3261
01:30:14.551 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 3>that's when he would lock that up and he said,</v>

3262
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3263
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Henzel talked about it recently.</v>

3264
01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 3>So just really surprised at how strong Sakharova was.</v>

3265
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:20.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3266
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 3>he's a strong little dude man.</v>

3267
01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Cause he had been rolling in are fighting rather with much larger guys.</v>

3268
01:30:25.561 --> 01:30:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Like he fought Conan and Sylvia and the first UFC when he fought in Japan and</v>

3269
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.530
<v Speaker 3>was a 98 maybe.</v>

3270
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>

3271
01:30:32.551 --> 01:30:32.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3272
01:30:32.821 --> 01:30:36.720
<v Speaker 3>one 90 something and Conan is like two 50 and a,</v>

3273
01:30:36.721 --> 01:30:37.890
<v Speaker 3>he tapped him with an arm bar,</v>

3274
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:38.461
<v Speaker 3>if you remember that.</v>

3275
01:30:38.461 --> 01:30:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And it was like one of the first times we ever saw a Brazilian jujitsu black</v>

3276
01:30:41.711 --> 01:30:42.690
<v Speaker 3>belt get tapped.</v>

3277
01:30:42.691 --> 01:30:43.081
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

3278
01:30:43.081 --> 01:30:43.914
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3279
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.910
<v Speaker 3>That was the introduction of the world to Sakharova.</v>

3280
01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:48.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3281
01:30:48.271 --> 01:30:48.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3282
01:30:48.481 --> 01:30:48.991
<v Speaker 3>it's funny when,</v>

3283
01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:49.824
<v Speaker 3>as a kid,</v>

3284
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:50.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3285
01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:53.760
<v Speaker 3>York barbell was like the Mecca for strange training in those days.</v>

3286
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 3>And Bob Hoffman,</v>

3287
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:57.420
<v Speaker 3>the father of American weightlifting weight training.</v>

3288
01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:02.780
<v Speaker 3>He had the system called the heavy light system where you would use heavyweights</v>

3289
01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 3>one during one session and then lighter weights the next.</v>

3290
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 3>But the letter wastes weren't that light.</v>

3291
01:31:08.370 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 3>They just felt bike.</v>

3292
01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Cause you had used heavyweights before and sometimes even in the same session,</v>

3293
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 3>you would hold a really heavyweight and then when you go to your normal weight,</v>

3294
01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 3>it felt ridiculously light.</v>

3295
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3296
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:20.783
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3297
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I used to do that in wrestling.</v>

3298
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I called up my heavy light system and I would spar with all the heavyweights,</v>

3299
01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:26.941

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:28.470
<v Speaker 3>all the big boys.</v>

3302
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 3>And then when I went with God in my own way,</v>

3303
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.550
<v Speaker 3>they felt like toys.</v>

3304
01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3305

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:34.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3307
01:31:34.471 --> 01:31:35.580
<v Speaker 3>The heavy light system,</v>

3308
01:31:35.581 --> 01:31:35.971
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

3309
01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3310
01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to a lot of guys that had experience wrestling with big guys,</v>

3311
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:41.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3312
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.180
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu and so forth.</v>

3313
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>It does truly make guys your own weight.</v>

3314
01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Feel like nothing you would,</v>

3315
01:31:48.121 --> 01:31:48.811
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine so.</v>

3316
01:31:48.811 --> 01:31:51.230
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like really bad on your joints.</v>

3317
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:51.961
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be careful,</v>

3318
01:31:51.961 --> 01:31:52.171
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3319
01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:53.130

01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:53.551
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

3321
01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:54.301
<v Speaker 3>really be careful.</v>

3322
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:54.490
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

3323
01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a young man's technique.</v>

3324
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:57.054
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3325
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I would not use the heavy light system myself,</v>

3326
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3416
01:33:44.461 --> 01:33:46.170
<v Speaker 3>after you've trained for five years,</v>

3417
01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.940
<v Speaker 3>you put on a blue belt and that signify to the senior student.</v>

01:34:28.441 --> 01:34:29.540
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt that he was.</v>

3446
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3447
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:32.320
<v Speaker 3>he just knows what he's,</v>

3448
01:34:32.321 --> 01:34:32.611
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3449
01:34:32.611 --> 01:34:32.881
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3450
01:34:32.881 --> 01:34:33.481
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

3451
01:34:33.481 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3452
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.280
<v Speaker 3>he's not trying to bully him.</v>

3453
01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:36.630
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to use technique.</v>

3454
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.710
<v Speaker 3>But it look at that.</v>

3455
01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

3456
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:40.953
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3457
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I just love watching that.</v>

3458
01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

3459
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 3>love watching that.</v>

3460
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:46.120
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

3461
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 3>there's really a difference in this in comparison to striking arts because you</v>

3462
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:51.520
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3463
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.940
<v Speaker 3>if these guys were kickboxing after a few leg kicks,</v>

3464
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:57.830
<v Speaker 3>well as long as you know how to do break falls,</v>

3465
01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

3466
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

3467
01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

3468
01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 2>that's so beautiful.</v>

3469
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3470
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:01.221
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3471
01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:02.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3472
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:02.211
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3473
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

3474
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:03.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3475
01:35:03.051 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3476
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I find that with the grappling arts you can pretty much keep going for much</v>

3477
01:35:07.941 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>

3478
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>You certainly much older than sparring with striking.</v>

3479
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:11.931
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3480
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:12.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a a sounding,</v>

3481
01:35:12.971 --> 01:35:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but this book I'm reading about the history of Brazilian Jujitsu and uh,</v>

3482
01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about like the Japanese,</v>

3483
01:35:17.661 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>when they first came to America,</v>

3484
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>it was the first clash of cultures.</v>

3485
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 2>The judo man,</v>

3486
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 2>we're finding that they couldn't stand up to the American catches catch can</v>

3487
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:27.314
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers.</v>

3488
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 2>The Americans were bigger,</v>

3489
01:35:28.611 --> 01:35:29.181
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

3490
01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:30.014
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>

3491
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.093
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>

3492
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't take them down with a lot of this throws,</v>

3493
01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the wrestlers won't wear the jackets.</v>

3494
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:40.160
<v Speaker 2>That's where the guard really became developed,</v>

3495
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:43.310
<v Speaker 2>really found that if they could pull them into the guard,</v>

3496
01:35:43.311 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 2>they can dispatch them with farmlogs triangles.</v>

3497
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he insisted that the wrestlers wear the jackets in these fights like,</v>

3498
01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:50.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3499
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.673
<v Speaker 2>like my Ada.</v>

3500
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.500
<v Speaker 2>And then of course they could set the choke pretty easy on these guys.</v>

3501
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Very fascinating book.</v>

3502
01:35:56.591 --> 01:35:56.781
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3503
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:57.381
<v Speaker 2>it's really fun.</v>

3504
01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>I bought it off Amazon and have it on my kindle.</v>

3505
01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm halfway through it right now.</v>

3506
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to the point now where my Ada starts teaching Carlos Gracie why?</v>

3507
01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 2>But the history of the sport is absolutely fascinating.</v>

3508
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:10.183
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

3509
01:36:10.190 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Have you been paying attention at all to Metamorris?</v>

3510
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3511
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3512
01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.080
<v Speaker 2>my son Zach,</v>

3513
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:17.840
<v Speaker 2>that was a tough match for him.</v>

3514
01:36:18.650 --> 01:36:19.710
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do no,</v>

3515
01:36:19.711 --> 01:36:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

3516
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.470
<v Speaker 2>that's not his game at all.</v>

3517
01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.590
<v Speaker 2>He's always only doing it.</v>

3518
01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:22.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3519
01:36:22.781 --> 01:36:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3520
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3521
01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3522
01:36:24.231 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>For your first professional blackbelt match,</v>

3528
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.333
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

3529
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 2>I really questioned,</v>

3530
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3531
01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:36.050
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3532
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.681

3533
01:36:36.681 --> 01:36:37.400
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3534
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:37.881
<v Speaker 2>he just said,</v>

3535
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:38.001
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3536
01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:38.630
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3537
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted a challenge that's just really want to fight.</v>

3538
01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:43.160
<v Speaker 2>That was the top guy and Gary,</v>

3539
01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

3540
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.010
<v Speaker 2>anytime you talk about Nogi submission wrestling,</v>

3541
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 2>that names up there with the bass man,</v>

3542
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:50.460
<v Speaker 2>did you see his match with Kroll?</v>

3543
01:36:50.461 --> 01:36:51.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3544
01:36:51.231 --> 01:36:51.741
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3545
01:36:51.741 --> 01:36:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how calm pulled that out man.</v>

3546
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a man as you serious crime but yeah,</v>

3547
01:36:56.661 --> 01:36:58.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like so yeah,</v>

3548
01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:03.710
<v Speaker 2>so I'm metamorris had dean lister versus Josh Barnett.</v>

3549
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett of course representing catch wrestling.</v>

3550
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett even came out like an old catch wrestling bikini bode shorts,</v>

3551
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 2>the shoes,</v>

3552
01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:17.920
<v Speaker 2>the shoes and tapped dean lister with a headlock with that,</v>

3553
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that judo headlock from from side control.</v>

3554
01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.740
<v Speaker 2>All you guys out there,</v>

3555
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>you blue belt and purple bots.</v>

3556
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget to practice your headlock escape man.</v>

3557
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.381
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

3558
01:37:27.381 --> 01:37:28.460
<v Speaker 2>and Jiu Jitsu training,</v>

3559
01:37:28.461 --> 01:37:29.820
<v Speaker 2>no one uses the head lockers.</v>

3560
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 2>It's usually pretty easy to escape from.</v>

3561
01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:32.601
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

3562
01:37:32.601 --> 01:37:33.890
<v Speaker 2>you give up your back kind of.</v>

3563
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3564
01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.220
<v Speaker 2>When you get out of a headlock you were in a pretty crappy position.</v>

3565
01:37:37.221 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3566
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:40.100
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't practice it,</v>

3567
01:37:40.101 --> 01:37:40.431
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3568
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 2>you can see what happens.</v>

3569
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:46.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean you get a high level athlete like Josh Barnett who is ridiculously strong</v>

3570
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>and he slaps it on you by surprise.</v>

3571
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Even a professional like dean and I mean Dean probably knows a hundred escapes</v>

3572
01:37:55.531 --> 01:37:56.364
<v Speaker 2>from a headlock,</v>

3573
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.061
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

3574
01:37:57.061 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 2>he had caught by surprise get locked up in that thing,</v>

3575
01:37:59.281 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3576
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:00.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3577
01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>that same position.</v>

3578
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I was actually giving a seminar for the United States secret service.</v>

3579
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I used to go down,</v>

3580
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:09.330
<v Speaker 2>they were just a 90 minute drive from my gym,</v>

3581
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.433
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia.</v>

3582
01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And I uh,</v>

3583
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I got to know some of these guys through Pavel and I used to go down and give a</v>

3584
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 2>self defense seminars as well as conditioning and Ken about seminars.</v>

3585
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 2>So one of the guys was an ex wrestler who got me in that position that Josh got</v>

3586
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>dean.</v>

3587
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I made a big mistake,</v>

3588
01:38:27.211 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3589
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.381
<v Speaker 2>The guy says,</v>

3590
01:38:28.381 --> 01:38:29.970
<v Speaker 2>well how do you get out of this position?</v>

3591
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:30.720
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3592
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>And so I lay down and I'll leave them do it to me,</v>

3593
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.180
<v Speaker 2>but the Saturday gun crank me with it and pop both of my ribs and I was crippled</v>

3594
01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:40.344
<v Speaker 2>for eight weeks.</v>

3595
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3596
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:41.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3597
01:38:41.431 --> 01:38:43.170
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty jerk thing to do.</v>

3598
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.681
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3599
01:38:43.681 --> 01:38:44.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3600
01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.980
<v Speaker 2>he would typically a typical herky jerky type of wrestler.</v>

3601
01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I was one of those guys myself at one time,</v>

3602
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.290
<v Speaker 2>but I just realized how dangerous that position is.</v>

3603
01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.470
<v Speaker 1>That's how Mark Coleman beat Dan Severen to when the first ever UFC heavyweight</v>

3604
01:38:56.471 --> 01:38:57.880
<v Speaker 1>title at same exact position.</v>

3605
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:58.620
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you,</v>

3606
01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:58.881
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3607
01:38:58.881 --> 01:38:59.960
<v Speaker 2>it is a power move,</v>

3608
01:38:59.961 --> 01:39:00.794
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

3609
01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.480
<v Speaker 2>if a guy knows how to do it right,</v>

3610
01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it freezes your diaphragm.</v>

3611
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It can dislocate your ribs,</v>

3612
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:08.630
<v Speaker 2>it can even cause some spinal damage.</v>

3613
01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just horrible to be caught in it and you go into an immediate panic.</v>

3614
01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:14.091
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3615
01:39:14.091 --> 01:39:14.511
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3616
01:39:14.511 --> 01:39:15.890
<v Speaker 2>you can really get hurt with that.</v>

3617
01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Not just NEC,</v>

3618
01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:17.690
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

3619
01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:18.410
<v Speaker 1>ribs.</v>

3620
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a power move,</v>

3621
01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:20.480
<v Speaker 1>but isn't a gating as well.</v>

3622
01:39:20.481 --> 01:39:20.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3623
01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a technique to it,</v>

3624
01:39:22.131 --> 01:39:25.310
<v Speaker 1>but as a technique to it and you certainly have to have some strength to pull it</v>

3625
01:39:25.311 --> 01:39:25.730
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

3626
01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3627
01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're wrestling anymore,</v>

3628
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.201
<v Speaker 2>buddy,</v>

3629
01:39:27.201 --> 01:39:28.670
<v Speaker 2>you're on size or a little bit smaller.</v>

3630
01:39:28.671 --> 01:39:29.550
<v Speaker 2>And Josh,</v>

3631
01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:30.384
<v Speaker 2>his case,</v>

3632
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:31.490
<v Speaker 2>he was bigger than dean.</v>

3633
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:32.151
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>

3634
01:39:32.151 --> 01:39:32.661
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

3635
01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And that</v>

3636
01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.100
<v Speaker 1>not much bigger than Dean Dean's huge.</v>

3637
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3638
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Dean's a pretty big boy.</v>

3639
01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.810
<v Speaker 1>He's really big now.</v>

3640
01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3641
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:42.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a way thicker than when he was fighting at two oh five in the UFC.</v>

3642
01:39:42.581 --> 01:39:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what he's walking around on,</v>

3643
01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.030
<v Speaker 1>but he looked to me to be like in the two forties or two thirties,</v>

3644
01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:47.840
<v Speaker 1>at the very least.</v>

3645
01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I went out it,</v>

3646
01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:48.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3647
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:49.750
<v Speaker 1>he's very thick.</v>

3648
01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:50.980
<v Speaker 1>But Josh,</v>

3649
01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Josh got him in that position.</v>

3650
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.411
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't escape,</v>

3651
01:39:53.411 --> 01:39:57.040
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing when you consider how much experience Dean has.</v>

3652
01:39:57.370 --> 01:39:57.941
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3653
01:39:57.941 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he had been tapped in competition over decades.</v>

3654
01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:01.840
<v Speaker 1>A hard guy to chat,</v>

3655
01:40:01.841 --> 01:40:02.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3656
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh so hard at the skill level,</v>

3657
01:40:03.851 --> 01:40:04.684
<v Speaker 1>his skillset.</v>

3658
01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:05.111
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

3659
01:40:05.111 --> 01:40:06.490
<v Speaker 1>both guys are fantastic.</v>

3660
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3661
01:40:07.631 --> 01:40:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3662
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:08.621
<v Speaker 1>that's grappling,</v>

3663
01:40:08.621 --> 01:40:08.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3664
01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And any given day,</v>

3665
01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I love also the different approaches that Josh has a different approach and you</v>

3666
01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:14.800
<v Speaker 1>see that that different approach,</v>

3667
01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:18.190
<v Speaker 1>that cast wrestling approach can be just as effective if he gets you in one of</v>

3668
01:40:18.191 --> 01:40:19.024
<v Speaker 1>those positions.</v>

3669
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3670
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:22.150
<v Speaker 1>it might be something you're not accustomed to,</v>

3671
01:40:22.151 --> 01:40:23.620
<v Speaker 1>so you haven't trained to get out of it.</v>

3672
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the first pro,</v>

3673
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3674
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:29.690
<v Speaker 2>grappling matches.</v>

3675
01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It was in,</v>

3676
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe you remember this,</v>

3677
01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it was like in one of the Carolinas,</v>

3678
01:40:32.961 --> 01:40:34.430
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina or South Carolina.</v>

3679
01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.031
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3680
01:40:35.031 --> 01:40:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the pro am or something.</v>

3681
01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:38.390
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy along goes this,</v>

3682
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:39.111
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

3683
01:40:39.111 --> 01:40:40.940
<v Speaker 2>back in the nineties maybe?</v>

3684
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:41.803
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3685
01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.490
<v Speaker 2>it was real early,</v>

3686
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 2>like late nineties.</v>

3687
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Was this the one where frank shamrock a wrestle Dan Henderson and they did like</v>

3688
01:40:50.731 --> 01:40:53.140
<v Speaker 1>a paper view thing and John Perretti was the,</v>

3689
01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't</v>

3690
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:55.061
<v Speaker 2>a paper view,</v>

3691
01:40:55.061 --> 01:40:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but they were paying cash prizes to the guys.</v>

3692
01:40:58.211 --> 01:41:03.211
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of the early attempts to do submission wrestling as a pro sport.</v>

3693
01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3694
01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:04.983
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3695
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember Salo was at the house,</v>

3696
01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:08.960
<v Speaker 2>he was training solid Humira,</v>

3697
01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:09.843
<v Speaker 2>so a bear.</v>

3698
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And he was wrestling the supposedly like the number one catch wrestler.</v>

3699
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:15.640
<v Speaker 2>He was living down in North Carolina somewhere.</v>

3700
01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.700
<v Speaker 2>And I had seen this guy in other tournaments and I warned him,</v>

3701
01:41:18.701 --> 01:41:18.941
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3702
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:19.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3703
01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy will give up his back to go for that twisting tow haul.</v>

3704
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:24.521
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3705
01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:25.190
<v Speaker 2>like when you go,</v>

3706
01:41:25.190 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>they loop over the toe hold and kind of flip upside down and go for your foot.</v>

3707
01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:30.461
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3708
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 2>the guys good with it.</v>

3709
01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 2>He's really good and wouldn't,</v>

3710
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3711
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 2>solid takes the back and the guy does it and pops his ankle.</v>

3712
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:40.270
<v Speaker 2>But Sala won't tap.</v>

3713
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:45.070
<v Speaker 2>He said he would have died before he tapped it as catch wrestler and then</v>

3714
01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't tap,</v>

3715
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3716
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:47.511
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3717
01:41:47.511 --> 01:41:49.000
<v Speaker 2>he choked the guy over the face.</v>

3718
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:49.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3719
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:50.950
<v Speaker 2>cause the guy was trying to hide the chin,</v>

3720
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 2>basically just put the guy out man,</v>

3721
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>and didn't mangle his ankle but mangled the angle.</v>

3722
01:41:57.021 --> 01:41:57.854
<v Speaker 2>So he won.</v>

3723
01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 2>But Oh my God,</v>

3724
01:41:59.021 --> 01:42:01.450
<v Speaker 2>that thing turned his black is this microphone man.</v>

3725
01:42:01.451 --> 01:42:04.330
<v Speaker 2>It was like he was in such pain that surgery.</v>

3726
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Now he did it and he's like,</v>

3727
01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:06.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3728
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.821
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell,</v>

3729
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I saw as another one of those guys that just like one of the toughest dudes I've</v>

3730
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:10.564
<v Speaker 2>ever met,</v>

3731
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 2>him and his brother to Sean's here,</v>

3732
01:42:11.771 --> 01:42:12.730
<v Speaker 2>just like so tough.</v>

3733
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.751
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

3734
01:42:13.751 --> 01:42:15.280
<v Speaker 2>he limped around and was hurt.</v>

3735
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the ankle was ever the same,</v>

3736
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of those deals,</v>

3737
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3738
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 2>with the catch wrestlers.</v>

3739
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Gotta Watch those guys are tricky is o hell,</v>

3740
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I see different things.</v>

3741
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:27.280
<v Speaker 2>He's the feet man.</v>

3742
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3743
01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:31.180
<v Speaker 1>it's guys doing different things and getting really good at those things.</v>

3744
01:42:31.181 --> 01:42:31.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3745
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of it.</v>

3746
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like if a guy has a like a a foot lock or something like that,</v>

3747
01:42:35.801 --> 01:42:37.540
<v Speaker 1>he just has down,</v>

3748
01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 1>he just knows how to do it and that becomes his thing.</v>

3749
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean some guys just have certain positions that you're not really well versed</v>

3750
01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 1>in and they go to it over and over and over again.</v>

3751
01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Like Eddie Bravo before he got famous for doing the twister.</v>

3752
01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I remember in John Jocks,</v>

3753
01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo would do a told he was a toehold guy.</v>

3754
01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:01.360
<v Speaker 1>He and he would get told on guys all the time because a lot of people weren't</v>

3755
01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:04.670
<v Speaker 1>good at toeholds so he would dive on told he was always catching people</v>

3756
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 2>that don't know how the defend a man.</v>

3757
01:43:06.551 --> 01:43:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3758
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a smart move and sometimes moves.</v>

3759
01:43:09.251 --> 01:43:10.031
<v Speaker 2>They're so old,</v>

3760
01:43:10.031 --> 01:43:10.481
<v Speaker 2>they're new.</v>

3761
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:11.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3762
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll see things go in trends and then people get good at stopping him and</v>

3763
01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:15.910
<v Speaker 2>they kind of go away.</v>

3764
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.710
<v Speaker 2>And then some older move,</v>

3765
01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:19.660
<v Speaker 2>we'll come back and you see these waves.</v>

3766
01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:20.891
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

3767
01:43:20.891 --> 01:43:25.891
<v Speaker 2>it's funny like I was sort of anti bear and Bolo and some of these [inaudible]</v>

3768
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.390
<v Speaker 2>version techniques.</v>

3769
01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm just jealous cause I,</v>

3770
01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3771
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:33.430
<v Speaker 2>my spine a little bit too old and stiff to do it,</v>

3772
01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 2>but the guys who look like they're having a good time when they do it,</v>

3773
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:37.181
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3774
01:43:37.181 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3775
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:38.051
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3776
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3777
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to my son and he says,</v>

3778
01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:40.481
<v Speaker 2>well dad,</v>

3779
01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:40.781
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

3780
01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 2>you can still got to learn that stuff.</v>

3781
01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3782
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:44.890
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't want to use it,</v>

3783
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you got to learn it to say,</v>

3784
01:43:47.081 --> 01:43:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you know how to stop it.</v>

3785
01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:49.181
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3786
01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:51.650
<v Speaker 2>because for sure if you don't know what you're going to get tapped,</v>

3787
01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you guys going to catch it.</v>

3788
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3789
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So you got at least practice it a little bit to be familiar with it.</v>

3790
01:43:57.110 --> 01:44:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And that being said is in New York City and as a wrestling with Gianni Grippo</v>

3791
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.711
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3792
01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3793
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible],</v>

3794
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the guys so much fun.</v>

3795
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:07.730
<v Speaker 1>He's one of more Cielo,</v>

3796
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:09.350
<v Speaker 1>a black belts.</v>

3797
01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>This kid is so good with that and it was really fun playing with him with that</v>

3798
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:14.661
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3799
01:44:14.661 --> 01:44:15.170
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3800
01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:18.950
<v Speaker 1>he could just flip upside down and roll and invert and next thing you know the</v>

3801
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>little suckers on your bag is like,</v>

3802
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 1>how did he do that man?</v>

3803
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:22.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3804
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting when guys get super sharp at one particular technique</v>

3805
01:44:27.351 --> 01:44:29.300
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not aware of that particular technique,</v>

3806
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it could become really dangerous.</v>

3807
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.761
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3808
01:44:31.761 --> 01:44:32.594
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3809
01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Braulio a steamer is famous for having that very bizarre guard as well,</v>

3810
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:41.870
<v Speaker 1>where he'll do those reverse triangles or inverted triangles and he gets himself</v>

3811
01:44:41.871 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>into a position where for to the outside observer it looks like,</v>

3812
01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:45.351
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3813
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:48.770
<v Speaker 1>this guy is on his neck here and it's weird position.</v>

3814
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden he's got a triangle on the guy and he's like,</v>

3815
01:44:51.461 --> 01:44:52.101
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

3816
01:44:52.101 --> 01:44:54.560
<v Speaker 1>People just so good at that position.</v>

3817
01:44:55.290 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 1>He's good at all positions,</v>

3818
01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.493
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

3819
01:44:57.590 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 1>That one position he's been particularly successful at because it's such an</v>

3820
01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 1>unusual thing to defend.</v>

3821
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are that scary with it.</v>

3822
01:45:05.410 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's like some people like criticize certain techniques,</v>

3823
01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:09.320
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

3824
01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:09.711
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3825
01:45:09.711 --> 01:45:09.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3826
01:45:09.981 --> 01:45:10.701
<v Speaker 1>I played around with that,</v>

3827
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work well.</v>

3828
01:45:11.901 --> 01:45:12.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3829
01:45:12.201 --> 01:45:13.160
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

3830
01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 1>What about like head kicks?</v>

3831
01:45:15.441 --> 01:45:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you play around with a headcase?</v>

3832
01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say they don't work because you know,</v>

3833
01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 1>many times you have to drill a head kick to get it effective,</v>

3834
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but then you get it up to like a point where like an Anthony Pettis has it or an</v>

3835
01:45:25.521 --> 01:45:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva has it and it becomes a real dangerous weapon in your arsenal.</v>

3836
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:30.921
<v Speaker 1>Cro,</v>

3837
01:45:30.921 --> 01:45:31.191
<v Speaker 1>cop,</v>

3838
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.024
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>

3839
01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:32.511
<v Speaker 1>cro,</v>

3840
01:45:32.511 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>cop drilled that damn head kicked to the point where he could throw it out like</v>

3841
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 1>another guy could throw a straight punch.</v>

3842
01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a standard straight punch.</v>

3843
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 1>That's how good and fast his head kick was and still is.</v>

3844
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

3845
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you discount a technique simply because you don't have the proficiency in it,</v>

3846
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:49.660
<v Speaker 1>you could really,</v>

3847
01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:51.870
<v Speaker 1>really get caught because you,</v>

3848
01:45:51.871 --> 01:45:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you really can sort of define the world and an inaccurate light.</v>

3849
01:45:56.150 --> 01:46:00.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you see a guy like maybe this bear and Polo Guy or Eddie Bravo with his</v>

3850
01:46:00.501 --> 01:46:01.334
<v Speaker 1>twister,</v>

3851
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:02.571
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

3852
01:46:02.571 --> 01:46:04.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a million different techniques that you're,</v>

3853
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.590
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to see emerge in MMA.</v>

3854
01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:07.580
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a discarded,</v>

3855
01:46:07.581 --> 01:46:08.840
<v Speaker 1>like the front kick to the face.</v>

3856
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was worried about the front kick to the face,</v>

3857
01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>

3858
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden Anderson acts out Vituro like when you're like,</v>

3859
01:46:14.571 --> 01:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>holy Jesus,</v>

3860
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:17.450
<v Speaker 1>no one ever expected,</v>

3861
01:46:17.451 --> 01:46:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but say this is the thing.</v>

3862
01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can't learn everything for sure.</v>

3863
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:20.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3864
01:46:20.871 --> 01:46:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you got to have your certain arsenal,</v>

3865
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:27.790
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly pays to be familiar with these positions and at least learn the</v>

3866
01:46:27.801 --> 01:46:30.740
<v Speaker 1>rudimentary basics so you understand it,</v>

3867
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:31.603
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

3868
01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you can recognize it because recognition is the first step to protect yourself</v>

3869
01:46:36.561 --> 01:46:37.394
<v Speaker 1>against this stuff.</v>

3870
01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So even if you never want to use it,</v>

3871
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.400
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3872
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.780
<v Speaker 1>it pays to at least learn it and be familiar with it and actually learn it</v>

3873
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>offensively.</v>

3874
01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:47.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a mistake that exact do,</v>

3875
01:46:47.631 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 1>especially wrestlers that are learning Jujitsu,</v>

3876
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 1>they decide water's going to learn defense.</v>

3877
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to learn Jujitsu defense.</v>

3878
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 1>You will never learn correct.</v>

3879
01:46:57.781 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu defense and less.</v>

3880
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You learn Jujitsu offense.</v>

3881
01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know how to cinch up a choke.</v>

3882
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:05.340
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know how to cinch up an arm bar,</v>

3883
01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to know exactly what you can get away with when you're</v>

3884
01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:10.404
<v Speaker 1>defending.</v>

3885
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And once you,</v>

3886
01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:14.070
<v Speaker 1>once you get adapt at or offense,</v>

3887
01:47:14.250 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 1>then you'll truly understand defense cause you'll understand what would I would</v>

3888
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:20.970
<v Speaker 1>be trying to do to me if I was in this position and how do I stop this guy from</v>

3889
01:47:20.971 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 1>doing that?</v>

3890
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.950
<v Speaker 1>All those little details.</v>

3891
01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like so,</v>

3892
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:25.410
<v Speaker 1>so important.</v>

3893
01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3894
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the most beautiful things about Jujitsu is there's so many</v>

3895
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:29.761
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

3896
01:47:29.761 --> 01:47:30.594
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>

3897
01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3898
01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you seem never ending.</v>

3899
01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:32.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3900
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And you see certain guys who have a very small wheelhouse of techniques if they</v>

3901
01:47:35.881 --> 01:47:36.660
<v Speaker 1>utilize,</v>

3902
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:40.260
<v Speaker 1>especially like attacks like Marcella Garcia was of course one of the best of</v>

3903
01:47:40.261 --> 01:47:41.040
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

3904
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:41.880
<v Speaker 1>But he has a very,</v>

3905
01:47:41.881 --> 01:47:42.840
<v Speaker 1>if you look at his,</v>

3906
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if you took all of his Jujitsu matches that he's won and look at how he won</v>

3907
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:47.670
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3908
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a very small number of chokes that he's used.</v>

3909
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost all,</v>

3910
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think Ricoh Rodriguez,</v>

3911
01:47:53.251 --> 01:47:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I think he got in with a leg lock.</v>

3912
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3913
01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 1>most guys,</v>

3914
01:47:56.251 --> 01:47:59.580
<v Speaker 1>he got Jake shields with a wrist lock I believe,</v>

3915
01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.080
<v Speaker 1>and one of those,</v>

3916
01:48:01.081 --> 01:48:01.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3917
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:02.990
<v Speaker 1>and I remember Rico Chaparral,</v>

3918
01:48:02.991 --> 01:48:07.991
<v Speaker 1>he had a professional Jujitsu tournament thing that he was doing in Los Angeles.</v>

3919
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Shakuri competed against Randy coture and Marcello competed against Jake shields</v>

3920
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 1>and I believe he got Jake and Arice lock,</v>

3921
01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:16.711
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

3922
01:48:16.711 --> 01:48:16.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3923
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:18.570
<v Speaker 1>he's got some crafty shit in there.</v>

3924
01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.453
<v Speaker 1>It really crafty,</v>

3925
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but most of it,</v>

3926
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Dia Tienes,</v>

3927
01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.680
<v Speaker 1>north south choke,</v>

3928
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 1>rear naked choke.</v>

3929
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's almost all next,</v>

3930
01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 1>almost at all attacking the next,</v>

3931
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3932
01:48:27.850 --> 01:48:28.683
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3933
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is such a complex sport.</v>

3934
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3935
01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I liken it to a,</v>

3936
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

3937
01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I like him wrestling and being a former restaurant,</v>

3938
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.960
<v Speaker 1>more like checkers and Jujitsu to chess,</v>

3939
01:48:39.961 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 1>but not just chest,</v>

3940
01:48:41.401 --> 01:48:42.600
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional chess.</v>

3941
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It really is maybe submission.</v>

3942
01:48:44.881 --> 01:48:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling would be more like regular chest and then re Jujitsu with the gate</v>

3943
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:51.810
<v Speaker 1>with all the different ways you can manipulate the cloth.</v>

3944
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Almost like three dimensional chess.</v>

3945
01:48:53.941 --> 01:48:57.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a huge variety of,</v>

3946
01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

3947
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3948
01:48:58.111 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 1>The only problem I have with the ghee is a,</v>

3949
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people get brainwashed into thinking that you need to learn to</v>

3950
01:49:03.651 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 1>g to be good at Jujitsu and MMA.</v>

3951
01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And Eddie Bravo in particular is very adamant that that is a ridiculous idea.</v>

3952
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.381
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3953
01:49:10.381 --> 01:49:12.870
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying you have to be really good at racquetball to be good at</v>

3954
01:49:12.871 --> 01:49:13.440
<v Speaker 1>tennis.</v>

3955
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:13.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3956
01:49:13.681 --> 01:49:16.950
<v Speaker 1>It's two different sports all together was just so much to grip.</v>

3957
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And you see so many guys that are world champions or the competed a very high</v>

3958
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:25.260
<v Speaker 1>level with the g and then they fight an MMA and everyone's sweaty and they have</v>

3959
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:28.710
<v Speaker 1>gloves on and they can't grab things and they,</v>

3960
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 1>they say specific man,</v>

3961
01:49:30.541 --> 01:49:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop the specific skills towards your fighting conditions.</v>

3962
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.221
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3963
01:49:35.221 --> 01:49:35.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3964
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3965
01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:39.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the most elegant definitions of Jujitsu I ever heard,</v>

3966
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.823
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

3967
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it came from house and crazy.</v>

3968
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It was at a seminar in Atlantic city.</v>

3969
01:49:44.431 --> 01:49:46.380
<v Speaker 1>This is like one of the early Gracie seminars.</v>

3970
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.393
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3971
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 1>this is back</v>

3972
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>in the day when he never knew what kind of Wacko was going to walk in through</v>

3973
01:49:50.801 --> 01:49:50.961
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3974
01:49:50.961 --> 01:49:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you'd even get people that one of the challenge in the seminars and</v>

3975
01:49:54.831 --> 01:49:55.970
<v Speaker 3>there was this guy that came in,</v>

3976
01:49:55.971 --> 01:49:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God with flowing robes,</v>

3977
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 3>like this kung fu guy with this big red sash.</v>

3978
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 3>And so w right in the middle of the seminar,</v>

3979
01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 3>he interrupts,</v>

3980
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 3>well Mr Gracie,</v>

3981
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:07.594
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

3982
01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:08.523
<v Speaker 3>could you,</v>

3983
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.040
<v Speaker 3>could you give me the definition of your philosophy of Jujitsu?</v>

3984
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:13.691
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>

3985
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:14.524
<v Speaker 3>oh boy.</v>

3986
01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Because you know Helson his English wasn't the most,</v>

3987
01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 3>it was hard to understand sometimes,</v>

3988
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3989
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 3>plus he mixed it with the Hawaiian Slam,</v>

3990
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:23.500
<v Speaker 3>but he says when the fight,</v>

3991
01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 3>when I know I can win the fight,</v>

3992
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I can pretty much,</v>

3993
01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:27.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3994
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:32.200
<v Speaker 3>be that nice guy and kind and loving and all that towards other people.</v>

3995
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:32.801
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>

3996
01:50:32.801 --> 01:50:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I had that confidence with myself that I know I can,</v>

3997
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I can protect myself,</v>

3998
01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to be insecure.</v>

3999
01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:39.873
<v Speaker 3>So the guy says,</v>

4000
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4001
01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:41.800
<v Speaker 3>could you expound on that?</v>

4002
01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 3>And of course first we have to explain what expound means,</v>

4003
01:50:43.961 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

4004
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 3>And we're thinking,</v>

4005
01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:46.180
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4006
01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 3>what's he going to say here?</v>

4007
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:49.660
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

4008
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:51.573
<v Speaker 3>Jiu Jitsu,</v>

4009
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 3>if you do dis,</v>

4010
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I do that and if you do that,</v>

4011
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I do this forever.</v>

4012
01:50:59.230 --> 01:50:59.621
<v Speaker 3>And we said,</v>

4013
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

4014
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 3>that is some deep shit.</v>

4015
01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 3>It's getting a three by five cards.</v>

4016
01:51:04.781 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 3>And I actually had that in my school.</v>

4017
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I actually wrote that and put it on the wall.</v>

4018
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:09.693
<v Speaker 3>If you do this,</v>

4019
01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>

4020
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:11.290
<v Speaker 3>And if you do that,</v>

4021
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:13.330
<v Speaker 3>I do this for ever.</v>

4022
01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's like wow,</v>

4023
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:15.401
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

4024
01:51:15.401 --> 01:51:16.720
<v Speaker 3>It goes into infinity man.</v>

4025
01:51:16.810 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're constantly moving one step ahead of the guy.</v>

4026
01:51:19.571 --> 01:51:20.404
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

4027
01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I liken it to having a conversation,</v>

4028
01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:27.310
<v Speaker 3>like if you have a conversation with someone who speaks very broken English,</v>

4029
01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you could really kind of talk circles around them.</v>

4030
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:30.280
<v Speaker 3>You could just,</v>

4031
01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're an articulate person,</v>

4032
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 3>especially of course you can make them look really silly.</v>

4033
01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:35.021
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

4034
01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:35.311
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

4035
01:51:35.311 --> 01:51:36.040
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to say?</v>

4036
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:36.761
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to say nothing.</v>

4037
01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know how to talk my language stupid,</v>

4038
01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:38.681
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4039
01:51:38.681 --> 01:51:40.400
<v Speaker 3>And you could just literally do just rattle on,</v>

4040
01:51:40.401 --> 01:51:40.930
<v Speaker 3>attack them.</v>

4041
01:51:40.930 --> 01:51:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I think they call it soft history.</v>

4042
01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Is Sophos a lawyer?</v>

4043
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:45.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4044
01:51:45.411 --> 01:51:46.360
<v Speaker 3>some guys,</v>

4045
01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:47.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4046
01:51:47.741 --> 01:51:49.150
<v Speaker 3>be aggressive and rude about it,</v>

4047
01:51:49.151 --> 01:51:53.440
<v Speaker 3>but some guys can do that with Jujitsu where you kind of have to think yourself</v>

4048
01:51:53.441 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 3>through every step and you're not kind of aware.</v>

4049
01:51:56.321 --> 01:51:56.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4050
01:51:56.531 --> 01:51:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that's how I always feel when I would roll with guys who I got a really,</v>

4051
01:51:59.561 --> 01:52:03.250
<v Speaker 3>really high level and it's like I'm not prepared for all the steps that you</v>

4052
01:52:03.251 --> 01:52:05.350
<v Speaker 3>could take to counter my step.</v>

4053
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:05.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4054
01:52:05.831 --> 01:52:08.770
<v Speaker 3>I will do a move and you will do your mood,</v>

4055
01:52:08.771 --> 01:52:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but you also have all these you,</v>

4056
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:12.580
<v Speaker 3>you were already anticipating to counter this.</v>

4057
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.361
<v Speaker 3>I've got to do that.</v>

4058
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to stop this by putting my hand on your knee here and putting my</v>

4059
01:52:16.511 --> 01:52:20.320
<v Speaker 3>foot on your hip here and now you're going to have to try to get out of it.</v>

4060
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:23.170
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not going to let you get out of it because I'm already anticipating that</v>

4061
01:52:23.171 --> 01:52:24.310
<v Speaker 3>as I'm already so far.</v>

4062
01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4063
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:25.441
<v Speaker 3>like Hixon Gracie,</v>

4064
01:52:25.441 --> 01:52:26.620
<v Speaker 3>he always used to say about guys,</v>

4065
01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.540
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be able to keep up the rhythm,</v>

4066
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:30.820
<v Speaker 3>not gonna be able to keep up the rhythm.</v>

4067
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:32.120
<v Speaker 3>You know that like you're going to,</v>

4068
01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I do this and you do that.</v>

4069
01:52:34.031 --> 01:52:34.421
<v Speaker 3>I do this,</v>

01:52:35.230 --> 01:52:36.250
<v Speaker 3>How long can you keep that up?</v>

4073
01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.113
<v Speaker 3>How long your teeth that really,</v>

4074
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:38.170

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4077
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing because the guy was pretty profound and is a very simple way.</v>

4078
01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:45.680
<v Speaker 3>The way he had explained things,</v>

4079
01:52:45.681 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

4080
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>pretty amazing but simple.</v>

4081
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Roddy was complainant.</v>

4082
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 2>How easily he was catching him and says,</v>

4083
01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.073
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4084
01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I know everything you know and everything else.</v>

4085
01:52:59.120 --> 01:52:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

4086
01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4087
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

4088
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>He says maybe,</v>

4089
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:07.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I got sick or injured and was in the hospital for like three years and</v>

4090
01:53:08.241 --> 01:53:09.074
<v Speaker 2>did train.</v>

4091
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I came back you might have a chance.</v>

4092
01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:15.330
<v Speaker 2>But it's true.</v>

4093
01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:15.941
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

4094
01:53:15.941 --> 01:53:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't it be true to me the guy's done it is what I mean.</v>

4095
01:53:17.811 --> 01:53:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey born Warren under Matt.</v>

4096
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4097
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Ron has been saying that about a female opponents.</v>

4098
01:53:23.031 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4099
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:24.283
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

4100
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4101
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:28.850
<v Speaker 1>what's going on now is I've been doing this my whole life and these girls are</v>

4102
01:53:28.851 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 1>just not going to catch up to me.</v>

4103
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're seeing.</v>

4104
01:53:31.251 --> 01:53:34.580
<v Speaker 1>When we saw that beautiful arm bar that just landed on Zingano,</v>

4105
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:35.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's in Ghana.</v>

4106
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 1>What tax?</v>

4107
01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:36.761
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

4108
01:53:36.761 --> 01:53:40.190
<v Speaker 1>And it tries to throw a Rhonda addressed winds up on top,</v>

4109
01:53:40.191 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 1>recognizes the position where the arm is.</v>

4110
01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was talking to George Greer Gel and uh,</v>

4111
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:46.190
<v Speaker 1>about it at the last UFC.</v>

4112
01:53:46.191 --> 01:53:46.551
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4113
01:53:46.551 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 1>that's when I bowed down to Rhonda and that's how he said it.</v>

4114
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean George is a black belt as well and he's like,</v>

4115
01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:51.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4116
01:53:51.651 --> 01:53:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I saw her arm bars.</v>

4117
01:53:52.881 --> 01:53:53.151
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4118
01:53:53.151 --> 01:53:53.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah she's got a good arm.</v>

4119
01:53:53.991 --> 01:53:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Bars was sometimes she does things that I don't agree with.</v>

4120
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So it looked like maybe her knees are a little too wide apart even though she's</v>

4121
01:53:58.791 --> 01:53:59.750
<v Speaker 1>catching these girls.</v>

4122
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's catching these girls cause they're just not that technical.</v>

4123
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:02.871
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4124
01:54:02.871 --> 01:54:04.640
<v Speaker 1>well when she hit that on barns in Ghana,</v>

4125
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:06.100
<v Speaker 1>14 seconds and he's like,</v>

4126
01:54:06.101 --> 01:54:07.120
<v Speaker 1>look I got a bow down.</v>

4127
01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:08.750
<v Speaker 2>That's some high level,</v>

4128
01:54:08.751 --> 01:54:09.471
<v Speaker 2>high level,</v>

4129
01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:11.190
<v Speaker 2>high level technique man.</v>

4130
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 2>The ability to adjust and again that language that she has in her head,</v>

4131
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:18.800
<v Speaker 2>she's so articulate with the language of submissions.</v>

4132
01:54:18.850 --> 01:54:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And in her case armbars you know,</v>

4133
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:22.210
<v Speaker 2>just so good at arm bar.</v>

4134
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.881
<v Speaker 2>What a talent,</v>

4135
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

4136
01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It looks like she has quite a buddy movie career as well.</v>

4137
01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:25.930
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

4138
01:54:25.930 --> 01:54:26.731
<v Speaker 2>she's not a battle.</v>

4139
01:54:26.731 --> 01:54:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Some gals beautiful aside the swimsuit issue or whether the man,</v>

4152
01:54:56.751 --> 01:54:57.440
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

4153
01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 2>You all right.</v>

4154
01:54:58.401 --> 01:54:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you all right?</v>

4155
01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.350
<v Speaker 2>We got an it guy.</v>

4156
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:02.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't trash talk to?</v>

4157
01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:02.894
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4158
01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you just don't trash by that man.</v>

4159
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it was kind of like let it out in advance.</v>

4160
01:55:07.290 --> 01:55:08.090
<v Speaker 2>He think,</v>

4161
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 2>what did he think?</v>

4162
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:11.630
<v Speaker 2>He's wanting to get attention to make a video.</v>

4163
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:15.920
<v Speaker 2>You put on a gay and a and then you trash talk to the girl.</v>

4164
01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4165
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:18.200
<v Speaker 2>like you're not going to,</v>

4166
01:55:18.201 --> 01:55:19.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4167
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4168
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4169
01:55:20.241 --> 01:55:21.320
<v Speaker 2>people got upset when I said that.</v>

4170
01:55:21.321 --> 01:55:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I think she could beat a lot of men in her in that way.</v>

4171
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they would,</v>

4172
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 2>well cause they don't know.</v>

4173
01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I've never rolled with a girl who is really good.</v>

4174
01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I made like in a natural world,</v>

4175
01:55:31.311 --> 01:55:36.311
<v Speaker 2>right outline this can sometimes beat a male line if they're the same size.</v>

4176
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4177
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.713
<v Speaker 2>I mean you never know.</v>

4178
01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.030
<v Speaker 2>And if she has cub,</v>

4179
01:55:39.031 --> 01:55:40.290
<v Speaker 2>she'll risk your life to,</v>

4180
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:42.350
<v Speaker 2>and maybe he could beat her,</v>

4181
01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>but her incentive</v>

4182
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>is way higher than his incentive.</v>

4183
01:55:46.051 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 1>So he figures it's not worth it.</v>

4184
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Well technique is,</v>

4185
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

4186
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:51.833
<v Speaker 1>is paramount.</v>

4187
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And her technique is so laser sharp.</v>

4188
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 1>If she got in there with a guy who doesn't have that good a technique,</v>

4189
01:55:58.411 --> 01:55:59.490
<v Speaker 1>just because he's a man,</v>

4190
01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the physical strength and the inherent,</v>

4191
01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of being a male,</v>

4192
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:09.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever advantages that he may have aren't necessarily going to counter the</v>

4193
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>technique that she has when they're the same weight.</v>

4194
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're dealing with a guy like you know she's,</v>

4195
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>she competes at one 35 okay.</v>

4196
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:22.500
<v Speaker 1>If you deal with her versus a guy at one 70 like Johnny Hendricks,</v>

4197
01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 1>like Jesus of course that's a Mitch match.</v>

4198
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks is a powerful big strong man and he most likely would beat her</v>

4199
01:56:29.341 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

4200
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking about a guy who's her weight and then even if he's physically</v>

4201
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:35.341
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

4202
01:56:35.341 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe can hit harder.</v>

4203
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:40.110
<v Speaker 1>But how much of a technical advantage does she have on the ground?</v>

4204
01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:43.470
<v Speaker 1>She can easily catch you in something in a scramble easily,</v>

4205
01:56:43.471 --> 01:56:43.890
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

4206
01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:44.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4207
01:56:44.131 --> 01:56:44.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4208
01:56:44.461 --> 01:56:44.701
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

4209
01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:44.971
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4210
01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:46.350
<v Speaker 1>four steps ahead of you for,</v>

4211
01:56:46.351 --> 01:56:48.030
<v Speaker 1>for older guys like myself,</v>

4212
01:56:48.031 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 1>actually the women are some of your best bar partners,</v>

4213
01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 1>like the more advanced women,</v>

4214
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>they're fun to train with because they're not going to try to muscle it.</v>

4215
01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't usually,</v>

4216
01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.660
<v Speaker 1>it's rare occasionally,</v>

4217
01:56:57.661 --> 01:56:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but usually women won't use power.</v>

4218
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:01.770
<v Speaker 1>They do think differently than men.</v>

4219
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:06.980
<v Speaker 1>They have a different logic and they surprise the heck out of you with some of</v>

4220
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:09.900
<v Speaker 1>their attacks and the way they put their game together.</v>

4221
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun.</v>

4222
01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And usually women are pretty flexible,</v>

4223
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:17.660
<v Speaker 1>so their guards are a nightmare to get some of these girls with their daily</v>

4224
01:57:17.661 --> 01:57:18.050
<v Speaker 1>havens,</v>

4225
01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.710
<v Speaker 1>spider guards,</v>

4226
01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 1>like wow.</v>

4227
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Controlling those feet are,</v>

4228
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.310
<v Speaker 1>is a nightmare.</v>

4229
01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4230
01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And you think about someone's guard.</v>

4231
01:57:25.141 --> 01:57:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Someone's legs have to carry their body around,</v>

4232
01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:28.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4233
01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 1>say if they weigh 140 pounds like Rhonda or one 35 and you know you're carrying</v>

4234
01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 1>135 pounds around.</v>

4235
01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:34.981
<v Speaker 1>All by the way,</v>

4236
01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:38.130
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't really weigh one 35 she was one 35 on weighing day.</v>

4237
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I would imagine she rehydrates up to around one 50 close to it.</v>

4238
01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:42.661
<v Speaker 1>She does.</v>

4239
01:57:42.661 --> 01:57:43.201
<v Speaker 1>She's pretty,</v>

4240
01:57:43.201 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 1>she cares a lot of muscle in that frame.</v>

4241
01:57:44.911 --> 01:57:45.744
<v Speaker 1>It's just thick.</v>

4242
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And she's not,</v>

4243
01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.150
<v Speaker 1>she's not a skinny girl by any stretch.</v>

4244
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4245
01:57:48.421 --> 01:57:50.670
<v Speaker 1>She's not week by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

4246
01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:52.110
<v Speaker 1>She's very strong.</v>

4247
01:57:52.111 --> 01:57:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And so you're dealing with someone who knows how to manipulate their body and</v>

4248
01:57:56.791 --> 01:58:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they have these legs that are carrying around all of this weight all day long.</v>

4249
01:58:01.111 --> 01:58:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Your legs are amazingly strong.</v>

4250
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing endurance.</v>

4251
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And when you factor that in,</v>

4252
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 1>if you've gotten like I remember doing drills with my friend Felicia,</v>

4253
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:10.961
<v Speaker 1>Felicia.</v>

4254
01:58:10.961 --> 01:58:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4255
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it's one of John Joc Machado's black belts.</v>

4256
01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4257
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I know Felicia from the old RKC Kettlebell.</v>

4258
01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:16.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4259
01:58:16.491 --> 01:58:16.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4260
01:58:16.771 --> 01:58:17.880
<v Speaker 1>She's a kettlebell wizard.</v>

4261
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:18.990
<v Speaker 1>She loves that.</v>

4262
01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:23.910
<v Speaker 1>But I remember doing drills with her and you know armbar drills and she locks</v>

4263
01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:25.290
<v Speaker 1>and arm bar up on you man.</v>

4264
01:58:25.291 --> 01:58:26.820
<v Speaker 1>And you're dealing with legs.</v>

4265
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Legs are strong man.</v>

4266
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Even a small woman has very strong legs.</v>

4267
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4268
01:58:33.581 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the difference between male and female legs is very small percentage.</v>

4269
01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:38.580
<v Speaker 1>You know in studies,</v>

4270
01:58:38.581 --> 01:58:40.470
<v Speaker 1>if they've done a upper body,</v>

4271
01:58:40.930 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>there is a significant</v>

4272
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.790
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

4273
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 3>But where's the train woman?</v>

4274
01:58:44.261 --> 01:58:48.520
<v Speaker 3>She can close that gap and I'll tell ya for,</v>

4275
01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 3>for you older guys listening out there,</v>

4276
01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:50.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4277
01:58:50.291 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 3>you guys over 40 or if you're a guy that's been injured,</v>

4278
01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:58.240
<v Speaker 3>start seeking the girls out for sparring partners and you will have a wonderful</v>

4279
01:58:58.241 --> 01:59:00.280
<v Speaker 3>technical spar session.</v>

4280
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.960
<v Speaker 3>You also look like a little bit of a creep.</v>

4281
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4282
01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:03.533
<v Speaker 3>alumnae heads up.</v>

4283
01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Just don't be afraid to tap.</v>

4284
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:07.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4285
01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:09.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one with guys tapping to girls.</v>

4286
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:10.451
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4287

4293
01:59:16.650 --> 01:59:17.483
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

4294
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.571
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say,</v>

4295
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:20.404
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say what it,</v>

4296
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.273
<v Speaker 3>what content</v>

4297
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:24.851
<v Speaker 3>I would though.</v>

4298
01:59:24.851 --> 01:59:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure Robert could probably,</v>

4299
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.401
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

4300
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 3>if I get an a bad is I don't care who it is.</v>

4301
01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>

4302
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:31.000
<v Speaker 3>if it's a child,</v>

4303
01:59:31.001 --> 01:59:31.834
<v Speaker 3>I'll tap if,</v>

4304
01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.180
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4305
01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:33.760
<v Speaker 3>if I'm now,</v>

4306
01:59:33.761 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 3>now I'm to the point where my days were fighting out of stuff.</v>

4307
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:37.810
<v Speaker 3>If I'm,</v>

4308
01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:38.201
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

4309
01:59:38.201 --> 01:59:40.960
<v Speaker 3>if I make the mistake and I get into submission,</v>

4310
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I have to assume that if it was a person of equal skill to myself,</v>

4311
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.001
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4312
01:59:46.001 --> 01:59:46.834
<v Speaker 3>submitted,</v>

4313
01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:48.340
<v Speaker 3>he got me in this position.</v>

4314
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Fighting out of it.</v>

4315
01:59:50.051 --> 01:59:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Is it really technique is much as just strength or whatever,</v>

4316
01:59:53.711 --> 01:59:53.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4317
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:54.580
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>

4318
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:54.941
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>

4319
01:59:54.941 --> 01:59:55.710
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>

4320
01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:56.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4321
01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean the technical escapes.</v>

4322
01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4323
01:59:58.570 --> 01:59:59.500
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

4324
01:59:59.501 --> 02:00:00.860
<v Speaker 3>like you know what though?</v>

4325
02:00:01.090 --> 02:00:02.200
<v Speaker 3>The joint straight.</v>

4326
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4327
02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4328
02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Especially when it's fully locked in Zach or focus,</v>

4329
02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:09.910
<v Speaker 3>he got me straight toward the chokes set.</v>

4330
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:13.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just pain tolerance in or whatever.</v>

4331
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.830
<v Speaker 3>It's also the,</v>

4332
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:15.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4333
02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:18.160
<v Speaker 3>the price you pay just to keep your ego healthy.</v>

4334
02:00:18.370 --> 02:00:19.121
<v Speaker 3>Like physically.</v>

4335
02:00:19.121 --> 02:00:19.661
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

4336
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:19.901
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4337
02:00:19.901 --> 02:00:24.580
<v Speaker 3>my friend Brent got me in a Kimora and I didn't want to tap and I fought out of</v>

4338
02:00:24.581 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

4339
02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:27.100
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't do chin ups for months.</v>

4340
02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I had hobos so jacked,</v>

4341
02:00:29.141 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do chin ups for the long.</v>

4342
02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:33.700
<v Speaker 3>And I just remember everyday I would be at the gym when I was lifting weights</v>

4343
02:00:33.701 --> 02:00:33.940
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

4344
02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:35.560
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck didn't I just tap?</v>

4345
02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Because I would be fine right now.</v>

4346
02:00:37.331 --> 02:00:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Like either it was the same thing happened.</v>

4347
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I've tapped to him before,</v>

4348
02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.590
<v Speaker 3>he's tapped me before,</v>

4349
02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:43.080
<v Speaker 3>but I just would not happen.</v>

4350
02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4351
02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:44.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4352
02:00:44.081 --> 02:00:45.610
<v Speaker 3>you're just in that shrine center,</v>

4353
02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 3>but you got to treat it like it's basketball.</v>

4354
02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Someone scores on you in basketball,</v>

4355
02:00:50.231 --> 02:00:51.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not the end of the world.</v>

4356
02:00:51.281 --> 02:00:52.870
<v Speaker 3>You've got the ball and you go right back in.</v>

4357
02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Or are you playing softball and you pop fly out in the outfield or you get</v>

4358
02:00:56.081 --> 02:00:57.220
<v Speaker 3>thrown out at third base.</v>

4359
02:00:57.221 --> 02:00:57.760
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

4360
02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4361
02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:59.410
<v Speaker 3>You get another chance at bat.</v>

4362
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.221
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4363
02:01:00.221 --> 02:01:00.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4364
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times like,</v>

4365
02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:02.921
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

4366
02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 3>even though you do fight out of it,</v>

4367
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you are successful.</v>

4368
02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 3>The injuries already occurred,</v>

4369
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:10.690
<v Speaker 3>especially with the neck and you might not even feel it at the time,</v>

4370
02:01:10.691 --> 02:01:11.524
<v Speaker 3>but then it's like,</v>

4371
02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:12.580
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

4372
02:01:12.581 --> 02:01:14.440
<v Speaker 3>this really hurts man.</v>

4373
02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize it was his damages.</v>

4374
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:18.670
<v Speaker 3>There was maybe you're a little bit of adrenalized or,</v>

4375
02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:20.500
<v Speaker 3>that's why I love the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4421
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:23.450
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a,</v>

4422
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:26.920
<v Speaker 3>isn't it like a competition podcast or something?</v>

<v Speaker 3>A lot of friends doing that.</v>

4432
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 3>That's how old school radio mentality.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

4476
02:03:15.861 --> 02:03:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4477
02:03:16.130 --> 02:03:19.190
<v Speaker 3>I was a little concerned because like I wasn't sure what was it going to be like</v>

4478
02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:23.160
<v Speaker 3>a Howard stern thing where they tried to make it look like an idiot or no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

4483
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:25.970

4513
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I just came out with the five pillar workout system for kettle bells.</v>

4514
02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:18.510
<v Speaker 3>I have a mood,</v>

4515
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:20.750
<v Speaker 3>like a movement based exercise.</v>

4516
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I had a one with the body weight.</v>

4517
02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Now I came out with the Kettlebell five pillar movement system.</v>

4518
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Just release that and I'm going to be making one with the barbell five pillar.</v>

4519
02:04:32.090 --> 02:04:33.050
<v Speaker 3>So Nice.</v>

4520
02:04:33.051 --> 02:04:33.651
<v Speaker 3>And here we go.</v>

4521
02:04:33.651 --> 02:04:34.401
<v Speaker 3>This is the uh,</v>

4522
02:04:34.401 --> 02:04:37.620
<v Speaker 3>the website here as well as c.com.</v>

4523
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.491
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4524
02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you also custom tailor workouts for your clients through the Internet.</v>

4525
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.153
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

4526
02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I discovered a long time ago,</v>

4527
02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 3>about 15 years ago that uh,</v>

4528
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.473
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>

4529
02:04:48.930 --> 02:04:51.300
<v Speaker 3>they don't need someone to hand hold them through workouts.</v>

4530
02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.180
<v Speaker 3>They had the incentive to train if they just didn't know what to do.</v>

4531
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:55.950
<v Speaker 3>So I do die programs,</v>

4532
02:04:55.951 --> 02:04:57.240
<v Speaker 3>fat loss programs for people,</v>

4533
02:04:57.241 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 3>help them wade through all that huge information.</v>

4534
02:04:59.890 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I've had my own personal diet wars with,</v>

4535
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:06.831
<v Speaker 3>with myself and I pretty much figured out a way that you can keep lean year</v>

4536
02:05:07.081 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

4537
02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.010
<v Speaker 3>So I help people with diet fat loss and you know what to do.</v>

4538
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:12.530
<v Speaker 3>There's so much bench,</v>

4539
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:12.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4540
02:05:12.850 --> 02:05:14.400
<v Speaker 3>information and misinformation.</v>

4541
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.680
<v Speaker 3>W W how do you put all this together,</v>

4542
02:05:16.681 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4543
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 3>is difficult.</v>

4544
02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:21.570
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult to come up with a time to do all the research yourself and it's</v>

4545
02:05:21.571 --> 02:05:22.890
<v Speaker 3>all based in calls by the way.</v>

4546
02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different ways to crack the nut,</v>

4547
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.050
<v Speaker 3>so many different systems and they all work more or less.</v>

4548
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It just all depends on what it is that the guy wants.</v>

4549
02:05:30.691 --> 02:05:34.440
<v Speaker 3>So people really need a lot of help just sorting that stuff out.</v>

4550
02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:35.274
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I do.</v>

4551
02:05:35.610 --> 02:05:37.530
<v Speaker 3>And a extensive questionnaire,</v>

4552
02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4553
02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I analyze a photograph for structure,</v>

4554
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4555
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:41.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4556
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:42.840
<v Speaker 3>postural stuff and then,</v>

4557
02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4558
02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 3>you get a custom workout program and you send me training logs and I reviewed</v>

4559
02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:52.220
<v Speaker 3>them and sandy information back and do progressions with people and so forth.</v>

4560
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:53.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4561
02:05:53.011 --> 02:05:55.410
