Wonderful time of the morning to you.

The maker of the great bus,

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.120
<v 0>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.381
true.

15
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.490
Extraordinary.

16

And teacher of many great people.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.250
And to his left

18
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.800
<v 1>big wave surfer,</v>

19
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.710
Shane Dorian.

20
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.320
<v 0>Uh,</v>

21
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.790
we're all here in,

22
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.300
uh,

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.570
the night we've been on this epic bow hunting trip.

24
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.170
And,

25
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.471
uh,

26
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:56.621
we,

27
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:57.760
we figured we'd,

28
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:58.450
uh,

29
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.120
grace you find folks with a podcast.

30
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.630
Uh,

31
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.280
we've had a couple of beverages.

32
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.510
We're out here enjoying the beach and uh,

33
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.850
having a great fucking time

34
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.060
<v 4>boys and amazing time pair.</v>

35
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.380
Can't say enough about it.

36
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.183
What are you doing?

37
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.960
<v 1>Are you Instagram story?</v>

38
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.700
<v 3>John Dudley's Insta story in this,</v>

39
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.810
we're going to do what's called a swap cast.

40
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.220
So this will be available on my podcast and John will get a copy of it too.

41
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.870
So it'll be on knock on,

42
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.630
which is the premiere archery podcast.

43
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.590
If you're not listening,

44
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.870
you're probably not really slinging arrows,

45
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.773
Aria.

46
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.700
<v 4>Well,</v>

47
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.040
mostly it just not doing them correctly.

48
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:39.874
I had a,

49
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.220
I had a guy and he tagged me,

50
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.280
you and Cam and his picture and he had,

51
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
he made a hoy of these songs of that picture.

52
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.240
But he tagged us both and he was holding up this book and he said it's about,

53
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.870
it's about ready to get f and serious and he,

54
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.920
I mean this guy had never shot and he finally got one off of Ebay.

55
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.170
The GRE listeners,

56
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.480
they are getting into some bows.

57
00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:09.910
So ebay bu prices are going up.

58
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.110
Um,

59
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.160
neighbors,

60
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.731
uh,

61
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.980
insurance policies are also going up.

62
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.393
<v 1>Yes.</v>

63
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630
<v 3>Saw a lot of dogs that are hiding under the porch.</v>

64
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.080
Yeah.

65
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.070
<v 4>Based on and based on this hunt era prices brought.</v>

66
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.904
Yeah.

67
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.070
We're all going up.

69
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.620
<v 3>So let's explain this place because this place is a,</v>

70
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.041
Shane,

71
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:36.041
you talked about it on my podcast and it is maybe the epic bow hunting

72
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.150
destination on the planet earth.

73
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.050
<v 0>The gas is going to be out of the bag after everybody hears this.</v>

74
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.340
Huh?

75
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.210
<v 3>That's the problem.</v>

76
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:43.451
Right.

77
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:44.260
But should shut up.

78
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.831
We should say,

79
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.460
listen,

80
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.151
whatever you do,

81
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:48.520
don't go to Lanai because it sucks.

82
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.960
People are not friendly.

83
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.070
The weather sucks.

84
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.560
It's ugly to look at and there's no deer.

85
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.860
There's zero dear.

86
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:54.910
Yeah.

87
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.370
Yeah,

88
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.950
<v 4>they're out of,</v>

89
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.490
they ran out of beer like two days ago.

90
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.920
They ran out of beer deals gone and

91
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 5>the kill only comes in once a month and they bring it in a rowboat.</v>

92
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.180
Justin shooter sizes and an angry sailor drops it off at the beach.

93
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.030
You have to go get it.

94
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.541
Yeah.

95
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:17.020
It is like one of those tricky things where it's like you have to,

96
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.330
you have to like think of how much do I really want to talk about it

97
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.203
<v 4>this?</v>

98
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.133
Well,

99
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.431
if you're a hunter,

100
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:23.390
you appreciate it.

101
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.710
If you're not a hunter,

102
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.370
you're thinking,

103
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.050
what the hell?

104
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.361
It's cool,

105
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:27.194
we'll talk about it.

106
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.470
But it's,

107
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.001
you know,

108
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:29.571
when I came,

109
00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:30.530
when I flew in,

110
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.080
I actually asked a guy on the plane,

111
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:33.914
I said,

112
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.993
um,

113
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.310
is there any cool places like trying to serve?

114
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:37.671
I said,

115
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.480
cause I'm actually wanting to get some lessons on how to surf.

116
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.730
And the guy said,

117
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.930
well,

118
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.570
I don't know if you're going to have anyone good to teach you on this island.

119
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:48.921
And I said,

120
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:49.161
well,

121
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.900
I've got a pretty good guy coming in,

122
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.093
and he said,

123
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.090
well,

124
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.620
if there are good waves,

125
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.320
no one here would actually tell you where they are.

126
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.430
<v 5>So it's relevant</v>

127
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.540
<v 4>to what we're doing,</v>

128
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:01.930
right?

129
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.570
Yes.

130
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.180
If you have a good thing,

131
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.321
that's a problem,

132
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:05.530
right?

133
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.363
Almost.

134
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.100
You want to tell everyone how cool it was.

135
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.850
It's the same dude.

136
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.000
<v 5>What's that guy's name?</v>

137
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:16.320
He shout out his name.

138
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.010
What does it say?

139
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.270
Your friend Gavin.

140
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.860
You're friend Gavin.

141
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.220
That's hilarious.

142
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.980
Good for him.

143
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.813
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

144
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.133
The guy with the bow.

145
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.510
Yeah.

146
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.520
I haven't just gave you a big shout out,

147
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:37.990
bro.

148
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.350
That's getting into archery.

149
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.220
That's legit.

150
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.170
Don't shoot your neighbor or his dog.

151
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.571
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

152
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:44.160
definitely go to a safe area.

153
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.220
There's not really a problem.

154
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:49.170
There's not enough safe areas.

155
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.531
I mean,

156
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:51.410
you would think that La with a,

157
00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:55.140
a place that has 20 million plus people plus Mexicans.

158
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.460
I think there's,

159
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.880
there's shit to the numbers.

160
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.140
Like how many humans,

161
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.090
there should be more archery spots.

162
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:03.391
There's,

163
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.530
there's a few spots.

164
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.160
There's like maybe in the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area,

165
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.140
there's might be four or five impact.

166
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.810
Archery's a big,

167
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.700
<v 4>but you go down there right at San Diego.</v>

168
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.570
Um,

169
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.370
I go to a Bob Prom.

170
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.611
Yeah.

171
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.820
There's one one call performance archery performance.

172
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:18.654
Where's the impact?

173
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.130
What's the impact?

174
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.963
Our tree

175
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.560
crap,

176
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.371
I forgot his name.

177
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.130
He's in one spot.

178
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.280
Yeah,

179
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.000
that's bomb pro performance is at the Vegas spot.

180
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.620
This is a terrible time to like really pinned me down.

181
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.010
<v 5>I would go to the,</v>

182
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.230
but we're recording this podcast and my phone.

183
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.980
Um,

184
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.781
I think that's the place.

185
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:39.860
Yeah,

186
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.950
we

187
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.581
<v 4>go to in Vegas.</v>

188
00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:41.414
I'm pretty sure it is.

189
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.350
In fact,

190
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.160
I mean feel free to impact archery in Vegas.

191
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.301
I live in Austin,

192
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:47.691
Texas.

193
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:49.610
We got one boat shop that's worth anything.

194
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.620
I think you have a new place though,

195
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.454
right?

196
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.930
Your country.

197
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.690
It's been around for awhile but it's under new ownership and it's pretty crazy.

198
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.440
Pretty.

199
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
But I mean we,

200
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.040
there's a million.

201
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.020
Do you not have the Google App here?

202
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.250
I'm looking at your phone.

203
00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:04.180
I'm so confused cause I'm used to my phone.

204
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.190
Just go to safari on the top.

205
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.210
This mess.

206
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.253
Okay.

207
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.020
Anyway,

208
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.853
anyway,

209
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.411
listening,

210
00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:16.140
we're actually in a Joe Rogan's.

211
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.400
Yeah,

212
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.420
it's making out.

213
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.160
There's a pair of binoculars here.

214
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.910
They suck,

215
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.260
which actually suck.

216
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.360
But if we're looking,

217
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.920
if we look across that way like 2000 miles,

218
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.250
how many miles in 6,000 miles to 60,000 miles.

219
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.570
I'm so glad we have Shane Dorian in here because he's,

220
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.880
he's got the true logistics.

221
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.430
Last night we had an amazing beach cookout.

222
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.943
Um,

223
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.160
it,

224
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.570
I can't say enough about that.

225
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.680
We probably should tell without really giving the whole bunch of an id tells how

226
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:53.850
this became a thing.

227
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.350
Like how the hunt game.

228
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.900
I'm going to play this because a [inaudible] I'm going to go way back way before

229
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:09.521
this,

230
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:12.310
what you're about to hear and we apologize for what you're about to hear.

231
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.193
Um,

232
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.540
Shane and icon it together in New Zealand last year around this time and as

233
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.530
we're tooling around New Zealand,

234
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.393
Hun,

235
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.780
he mentions like what we're talking about,

236
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.180
Hawaii.

237
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.490
We were talking about elk hunting.

238
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.470
We're just kind of covering all the best spots in the world.

239
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:27.700
And he said something to me like,

240
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.550
when I is the best deer hunting,

241
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.500
you'll ever find bar none.

242
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.550
There's nothing different.

243
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.310
And you're like,

244
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.440
yeah,

245
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.831
bullshit.

246
00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:35.664
And I was bullshit.

247
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.380
Wouldn't check it out.

248
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.513
I'm checking it now.

249
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.093
Um,

250
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.100
and then you said the same thing on Joe's podcast and then,

251
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.450
and Dudley heard the same thing.

252
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:49.070
So Dudley and Joe and I were having a nice dinner in Vegas.

253
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.711
Yeah.

254
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:53.450
Lovely dinner with Joe's friend Andy stomps.

255
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:57.570
Shout out to Andy for crashing or dinner in the most epic way possible.

256
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.520
And so we're having dinner,

257
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.020
Andy orders about,

258
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.650
I want to say half a dozen Tequila shots.

259
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.790
We get a little bit excited.

260
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.990
Any other,

261
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.471
any orders,

262
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:12.471
a half dozen more Tequila shots and then he finishes it off with six more that's

263
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:13.494
accused.

264
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.640
So at that point we came up with this,

265
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.090
uh,

266
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.320
this was actually our facetime to Shane Dorian,

267
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.300
but we wanted to send,

268
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:24.910
we really,

269
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:25.930
really want answers.

270
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:27.230
So we actually recorded that.

271
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:28.620
You wanted to send a message.

272
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.890
So here was the message to Shane Dorian.

273
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.243
<v 6>Trey</v>

274
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.860
<v 1>listening to that while fairly sober.</v>

275
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.720
It's amazing how slow my voice was.

276
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.940
That was clearly like if I was talking to a cop,

277
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.103
I would just,

278
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.200
if I was a college,

279
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.330
wrote me right in jail.

280
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.940
You were wrestling those syllables like crocodiles,

281
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.040
crocodiles are to Griffey and who would be more like that?

282
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:26.540
Some sort of a slimy eel.

283
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.173
I had this,

284
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.570
<v 4>someone sent me this message on my phone years ago.</v>

285
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:34.700
It was a a car team they read.

286
00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:39.390
Did they cut the original member of the Rudolph cartoon or the original Rudolph

287
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.560
thing that everyone wants to watch and the nightlife?

288
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.010
Yeah.

289
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:43.843
Where's the bottle opener?

290
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.880
They said stressed out.

291
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.830
It was a,

292
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.320
uh,

293
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.320
clay animation of that Santa Claus being pulled over for drunk driving.

294
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.700
But he had a bunch of coke in his sleigh.

295
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.280
Has ever seen it.

296
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:01.880
But no,

297
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.270
he's like,

298
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.680
what's wrong off the for

299
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.530
it was hilarious,

300
00:10:06.531 --> 00:10:09.050
but that's pretty much how this whole hunt started.

301
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.750
<v 1>Say [inaudible]</v>

302
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.540
<v 3>well we're,</v>

303
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.260
we were in Vegas for shot show and one of the cool things about shot shows you

304
00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:23.810
get down there and there's a bunch of other people that are in a hunting and

305
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:24.980
everybody starts talking like,

306
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.371
man,

307
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:26.990
we gotta do something.

308
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:30.260
We've got to figure out as a hunt and a look,

309
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.040
this is,

310
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.300
we got one more day tomorrow morning is couldn't be,

311
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.840
or you guys are going to have this afternoon.

312
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.720
I can't cause I'm here with the family and I have multiple obligations but I'm

313
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:41.811
six time.

314
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:42.680
I might have to leave them by.

315
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.170
<v 1>I didn't say that Jessica,</v>

316
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.013
<v 4>if you're listening to this,</v>

317
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.380
I think that this is like one of the coolest places on earth.

318
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:51.210
We'd get better.

319
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.043
It really is.

320
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.903
It's like glass.

321
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:53.891
It's hard to be,

322
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:54.671
it really is.

323
00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:55.504
I mean

324
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.553
<v 3>you</v>

325
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.440
<v 4>just empty or quiver in an hour</v>

326
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.213
<v 1>for me.</v>

327
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.410
<v 4>Um,</v>

328
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.510
cause it's epic,

329
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.160
right?

330
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.120
Tons a year.

331
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.081
Lots of action.

332
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:09.460
Perfect going terrain.

333
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.451
In all seriousness,

334
00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:10.931
once you're here,

335
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:11.620
do you feel like,

336
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:11.801
hey,

337
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.260
this is important place like this,

338
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.680
these kind of places

339
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.940
<v 3>are important for hunting.</v>

340
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.640
Yeah.

341
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.220
It's just not a whole lot of spots like this on the planet that are pristine.

342
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.330
I mean this is,

343
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.070
it's hard to get here.

344
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.650
That's one of the beautiful things about it.

345
00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:28.840
It's like it's easy to get to Honolulu.

346
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.910
It's a little more difficult to get to Maui.

347
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.590
It's way more difficult to get here,

348
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.370
you know,

349
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.270
and that's what keeps people from coming I guess because that's a cool story

350
00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:38.260
though to the island.

351
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.360
And the island was originally,

352
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.250
<v 4>you know,</v>

353
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.150
really the revenue came from pineapples and it was a pineapple plantation.

354
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.560
And when we're like,

355
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.850
my knuckles are bloody,

356
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:50.970
I don't know if your guys are from crawling around the knees and my knuckles are

357
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:51.301
bloody,

358
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:52.650
but um,

359
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.130
everywhere you go there's like little one inch wide plastic pipe on the ground.

360
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.780
And that was all the irrigation,

361
00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.530
all the,

362
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.220
you know,

363
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.290
all the irrigation for the pineapples.

364
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.960
And he told us today that they actually,

365
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.153
um,

366
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.460
they buried that plastic,

367
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.180
um,

368
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.440
a lot of the black plastic that you see where they've now ground grounded up

369
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.090
because they took the pineapples out.

370
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.700
He said the plastic was seven feet under the top,

371
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.420
under the top of the soil so that the moisture's stayed between the top of the

372
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:29.560
soil and the plastics so that the pineapples would actually grow.

373
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.930
That's interesting because everywhere you walk you do see that black man,

374
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.200
he said they've tried to,

375
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.420
they've tried to get rid of it.

376
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.970
But he said it was seven feet under the topsoil.

377
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:41.830
Yeah,

378
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.750
pineapple isles.

379
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.540
Yes.

380
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:43.820
Fine.

381
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.130
Apple Island is what,

382
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.700
you know,

383
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.080
the references for the,

384
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.591
you know,

385
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:48.490
for the island,

386
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:53.491
but access me historically has been argued as the most pure,

387
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.600
tasteful meat on the planet.

388
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.860
It's so delicious.

389
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:01.330
Just what they serve at the hotel,

390
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:01.900
those,

391
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.231
those,

392
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:02.530
uh,

393
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.820
access meets sliders.

394
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.760
It's pretty insane because here at the hotel,

395
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.580
when they say venison burgers back in the states,

396
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.650
when they say Venice and we're thinking of Whitetail,

397
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.780
but here when they say benison it,

398
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.430
it's specifically is access that's native to the island and everything that

399
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:21.310
they're serving here at the hotel is the axis.

400
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.321
That real quick,

401
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:26.530
because when you get venison in America,

402
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.300
you're mostly getting it from New Zealand.

403
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.900
You're getting venison that is commercially raised.

404
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.250
A tremendous amount of elk and venison that you buy in America comes from New

405
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:41.250
Zealand because they classify elk isn't medicine to do sometimes Venice and all

406
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:42.550
of the year.

407
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.730
Uh,

408
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.541
I didn't know that,

409
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:44.374
but

410
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.360
<v 3>when I went to a restaurant,</v>

411
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.260
I went to a restaurant that's near my house and this guy is a really nice

412
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.190
restaurant and the like,

413
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:53.650
we have elk from New Zealand.

414
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.330
They're making it like it's a big deal.

415
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:56.164
I'm like,

416
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.140
brought it all the way over there.

417
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:01.600
There's poor elk are in some high fence.

418
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:02.870
Bullshit operation.

419
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.850
Congratulations.

420
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.090
It's okay.

421
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.070
It's like sadness.

422
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:07.961
Hey,

423
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:10.150
bring it over his slave that you shot in the head.

424
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.080
No,

425
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.890
I mean there's,

426
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.570
<v 4>they're red deer and the stag.</v>

427
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.190
Um,

428
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.790
and it's not elk in New Zealand.

429
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:16.091
It's red.

430
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:17.350
It's red deer stag.

431
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:20.710
And they're farmed over there like cattle and they're shipped not only to the

432
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:21.010
states,

433
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.330
less to the states and Morty,

434
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:23.340
Europe and Germany places.

435
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.151
<v 3>Well,</v>

436
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:24.661
one thing that,

437
00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:27.240
that place has in common with this place is no predators,

438
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.940
New Zealand and,

439
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.870
and Lanaya there it's a very strange situation where they brought over these

440
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:35.400
animals that are not native,

441
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.960
whether it's a,

442
00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.800
in New Zealand there's the stag and then there's red deer and a few other

443
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:41.490
different,

444
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.260
they're pigs in New Zealand

445
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.120
they do.

446
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.953
Now,

447
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.040
all those animals are invasive so they uh,

448
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.000
they go crazy.

449
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.010
They have to,

450
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.070
<v 7>you know,</v>

451
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.530
to control their populations.

452
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.590
When I was down there we were talking about the difference between the states

453
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.320
and here and they were talking about their need to,

454
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.781
you know the,

455
00:15:00.781 --> 00:15:03.170
the outfitter community there wants to make money of course,

456
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.170
but they also want to conserve and protect that population of wildlife.

457
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.041
There.

458
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:08.500
Problem is the,

459
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.230
the population on that island doesn't value the wildlife.

460
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:13.220
They see all this feral.

461
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:13.910
I mean they see,

462
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.910
they see Shami and they see tar him tar and they see red stags as feral

463
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:24.941
population or a non native mammal that they shoot at basis and they,

464
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:27.770
so they jumped in a helicopter and fly around and they shoot these animals.

465
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.120
And what these guys are saying is at this point the mine as well be indigenous.

466
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.130
I mean these are the animals that we have here.

467
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:37.850
We need to protect them and treat them like a resource and value them,

468
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:39.650
which gives them a better chance to go on.

469
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.330
Well the tourism in New Zealand,

470
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.980
how much of it is based on hunting?

471
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.900
It's got to be quite a chunk of it.

472
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.890
Good chunk of it.

473
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:46.880
But what they've done over there,

474
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:47.271
I think,

475
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:49.170
not to put a negative spin on it,

476
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.290
but if they take a lot of like a lot of our American sensibilities,

477
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.250
cause I think most clients that go over there,

478
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:56.090
some European,

479
00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:57.410
but the walking room American,

480
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.440
they've taken our American sensibilities and they've kind of turned it against

481
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:01.730
us a little bit that there's a lot of high fence,

482
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:02.420
red stag.

483
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.230
There's a lot of like come down here and shoot this $20,000 right animal,

484
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.670
which is a kin to throw it back to our trophy hunting.

485
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.030
But there are a lot of public land and there's a lot of awesome places to hunt,

486
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:17.360
which I think more folks are starting to find out if that's just kind of like

487
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:19.160
the dirty little secret of there is.

488
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.610
There was a lot of high fence,

489
00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:23.390
like every single one of those really big red stags that everybody sees and

490
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:23.500
went,

491
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:23.841
wow,

492
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:25.010
look at that to New Zealand stag.

493
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:26.600
Let's do the same thing in South Africa.

494
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:27.590
They're all in the farms

495
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.883
bread.

496
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.270
Completely a negative thing,

497
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:33.104
but like,

498
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.040
but it's weird.

499
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:34.820
It's weird.

500
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.930
It's a different mentality.

501
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:39.980
And it's also at the same time you're looking at an island that has so much

502
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:41.090
diverse public lands.

503
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.400
I mean you can be in the center of the South Island,

504
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.790
it looks like high desert in Nevada and you can go to the east coast and it

505
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.850
looks like the Brooks range of Alaska where we were last year.

506
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:50.230
Shame.

507
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.780
Yeah.

508
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.750
And then she'd go to the west coast and it looks like Jurassic Park.

509
00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.110
They don't have any tags and you can kind of like a goose with a rifle.

510
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.973
Right?

511
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.470
I don't know what I need juice rival days.

512
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.303
But yes there.

513
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.260
So there's no tag.

514
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:07.670
There are some areas where their arms are paradise ducks,

515
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.433
Paradise Duck.

516
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.280
So it's a,

517
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.680
it's a really cool looking waterfowl bird,

518
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.710
like a ton of the major waterfowl or is like go down there to shoot those

519
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:18.280
specifically they go down,

520
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.430
they want to shoot the pair.

521
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.680
Is it bad that I want to eat one when I hear its name?

522
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.330
Paradise [inaudible] I'll be the judge of that.

523
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.780
It sounds totally,

524
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.851
but it's like here.

525
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:33.410
I mean they compare us to hear that islands,

526
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:34.880
these islands are closed ecosystems,

527
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.830
so whatever you drive in here stays here.

528
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:40.580
Unless he's less these axis deer in this case or the red stags learned how to

529
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:40.941
swim.

530
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:42.770
This is how big 140 square miles.

531
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.470
That's crazy.

532
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.120
Showing a paradise.

533
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.060
This is this an audio only podcast.

535
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.340
The rare audio only podcast.

536
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.174
Lisa Jones.

537
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.370
That's a cool looking ducto man.

538
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.241
Yeah,

539
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:57.480
that,

540
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.220
that looks like a chicken fucked a duck.

541
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.033
That's

542
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.750
like a rooster was like,

543
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:04.530
bitch,

544
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.700
I'll show you who's boss.

545
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.520
I want to shoot that thing in New Zealand.

546
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:10.770
It's a big,

547
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.630
he is a big thing for sure.

548
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:15.540
We were there last year when the opening ducks and actually that's way cooler

549
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.600
when it's in flight because you get to see the full color.

550
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.743
Oh Wow.

551
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.611
Well how beautiful.

552
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.720
These access deer,

553
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.190
amazing.

554
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.440
I actually behind,

555
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:25.861
it's crazy,

556
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.150
Sam Yata photographer.

557
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.333
I mean it's

558
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.580
<v 0>photographing in this next level.</v>

559
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.380
I mean I've shot the main shot photos,

560
00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:35.590
a ton of elk and deer whitetail and mule deer and all sorts of stuff,

561
00:18:35.591 --> 00:18:40.150
but like it's so hot that the first so thin and just like the entire thing looks

562
00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:41.920
sleek and like the spots and everything,

563
00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:42.700
it's just,

564
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.310
it's crazy.

565
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.690
<v 1>And for a little history on Sam,</v>

566
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.470
Sam and Ben and I met up in BC was,

567
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.760
it was almost three years ago.

568
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.000
Right closing on,

569
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.210
we were talking about some stories.

570
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.270
We had a great time.

571
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.070
We had a great time in BC,

572
00:18:58.071 --> 00:19:03.071
but the epic cover of Peterson's hunting magazine with me carrying that Elk

573
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.530
Moose leg.

574
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:04.740
Okay.

575
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.300
That picture.

576
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.750
Yeah.

577
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.583
Yes he did that.

578
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.463
Sam's a bad ass.

579
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.270
I want like a signed picture from you.

580
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.900
Oh yeah,

581
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.010
that's the one I want.

582
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.490
I'll send you the,

583
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.520
I would love that Sam,

584
00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:17.820
what's your Instagram page?

585
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:19.400
Because you've got a lot on awesome photographs.

586
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.661
Just my name.

587
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:21.250
So it's just

588
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.083
<v 0>Sam soul,</v>

589
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.400
<v 1>s h o l t.</v>

590
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.353
So hole,

591
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.393
so volt.

592
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.160
And then you'd see the epic bus at Sam's got the bus or on.

593
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.561
That is so cool.

594
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:35.540
Explain that bus because that bus is so cool.

595
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.770
We were talking about it at lunch today.

596
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.560
Yeah.

597
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.610
So I bought a 1993 65 passenger,

598
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.640
bluebird schoolbus [inaudible] does a story tell you got a sweet deal.

599
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.140
George Bush's second term,

600
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.103
get a sweet deal.

601
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.660
Found it on craigslist,

602
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.250
just south of Fort Collins,

603
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.070
<v 0>Colorado and basically bought it directly,</v>

604
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.290
almost directly from a school district,

605
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.170
but they had totally rebuilt the engine and transmission.

606
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.880
So it's like ready to go.

607
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.871
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:20:11.871 --> 00:20:14.980
How many miles did it have on the rebuild on the body was a hunter.

609
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.480
<v 0>89,000 and then 20,000 miles on the rebuild.</v>

610
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.540
<v 1>So what'd you have to do Jeff?</v>

611
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.920
Dooney suspension work or I have souls or uh,

612
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.361
it's,

613
00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:24.770
I mean it's pretty stiff.

614
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.773
Where do you want to go?

615
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.800
I get,

616
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.080
I'll be able to sleep five in the bus and I'm also going to have a 10 by 20

617
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.750
<v 0>a wall tent that sits up next to it so we can sleep as many as we want.</v>

618
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.870
<v 1>And the wall tent,</v>

619
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.370
you're going to have hot water that pumps into the wall tent.

620
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:45.760
So you could actually take showers.

621
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.060
Yeah.

622
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.110
<v 4>So I'm gonna have a woodstove in wall 10 to keep the warm it up and then the hot</v>

623
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:53.290
tankless hot water heater will be connected to the end of the kitchen.

624
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.740
And I'll run it out the window so you can take a hot shower and a heated Walton.

625
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.230
<v 1>And you talked about this while we're in BC.</v>

626
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.651
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

627
00:21:00.651 --> 00:21:01.700
So the bus idea.

628
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.360
Oh,

629
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.193
the bus idea.

630
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.500
The original idea was to do like a 12th state Turkey tour in a bus.

631
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.130
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

632
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.980
<v 4>brother and his business partner and I came up with this scheme and then like it</v>

633
00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:17.030
just ate at me.

634
00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:18.530
Like I was like I need to get a bus.

635
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.450
<v 1>These [inaudible] said that I need to get a bus,</v>

636
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.340
<v 4>you know,</v>

637
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.420
it could be driving down the road,

638
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.300
like one would drive by and I'm like every one.

639
00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:27.640
I was like,

640
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.680
oh looking bus.

641
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.290
<v 1>It's such a good idea though</v>

642
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.021
<v 4>for getting around,</v>

643
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:32.471
going hunting,

644
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:33.960
doing hunting trips and yeah,

645
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.870
and it's going to be some like ripped all the seats out and totally converting

646
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:39.790
it into my little hunting shack.

647
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.750
It's an awesome idea.

648
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:41.020
Yeah.

649
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.090
So spending the next year in a bus,

650
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.240
isn't that funny how like when you get something in your head

651
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.730
<v 1>you are really into and then you start locking into it and other people are</v>

652
00:21:49.731 --> 00:21:49.831
like,

653
00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:51.000
what the fuck is wrong with you?

654
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.010
And it's like 1990s eighties series land cruisers.

655
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.970
Cause it's the last years where they had the,

656
00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:03.930
the front end rear solid axles and those trucks can drive anywhere and they're

657
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:04.950
not glamorous.

658
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.210
They don't look good.

659
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.880
But those fuckers never die.

660
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.690
Go everywhere you see e series land cruisers there insist indestructable yes,

661
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.393
of course there is.

662
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.560
There's a solid axle dude.

663
00:22:19.561 --> 00:22:24.561
You'll find them on Ebay with fucking 200,000 miles on them and their 50 grand,

664
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.381
you know,

665
00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:27.690
or maybe 30 I might have exaggerated

666
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.390
what they are,

667
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:30.810
man.

668
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:31.231
I mean the,

669
00:22:31.231 --> 00:22:31.501
the,

670
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:33.120
the like there's something about those.

671
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.170
And so I'd be like,

672
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.500
death,

673
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.400
that's an 80 series.

674
00:22:35.401 --> 00:22:36.000
My wife cooked.

675
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.990
The fuck is wrong with you.

676
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.670
So old Toyota.

677
00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:38.911
I'm like,

678
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:38.991
no,

679
00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:39.071
no,

680
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:39.151
no,

681
00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:39.910
no.

682
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.400
So Old Land Cruiser.

683
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.240
Do you understand?

684
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.240
Like there's a time when they were making these fucking cars that will go on

685
00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:52.341
forever and then they figured out like you don't make any money making cars that

686
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:53.340
go on forever.

687
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.270
That's the same thing.

688
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.780
Figure it out.

689
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.381
<v 4>Europe though,</v>

690
00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:00.120
when it comes to like gas,

691
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.460
you go to the,

692
00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.140
you go there and like our Toyota's there,

693
00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:05.670
they call him the Toyota Helix,

694
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.100
whereas we're driving it Tacoma or uh,

695
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.200
you drive Tundra.

696
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.870
Yeah,

697
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.080
they get like 60 miles to the gallon and they have a diesel engine.

698
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.690
You cannot buy that High Lux Lux.

699
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.250
I think it's,

700
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.083
I think it's a,

701
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.993
you,

702
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.830
I call it the helix.

703
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.120
Whatever.

704
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.080
<v 1>You can do whatever you want,</v>

705
00:23:24.081 --> 00:23:24.311
man.

706
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:26.470
I'm think it's up to you be the biggest one here you can do as

707
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.990
well.

708
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.760
It's a high line was what they call it.

709
00:23:31.761 --> 00:23:32.594
But yeah.

710
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.581
Well,

711
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:35.470
you know Neil already,

712
00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:35.720
you,

713
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.860
you know Neil Young,

714
00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:37.610
he has a,

715
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:42.610
<v 4>a farm in northern California and he makes his own biodiesel and he runs all of</v>

716
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:43.441
us.

717
00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:43.621
Yeah.

718
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:44.580
He runs all of his cars.

719
00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:45.414
I'm,

720
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.160
she does.

721
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

722
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.040
Let's talk about new young 32nd motherfucker.

723
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.590
Neil Young's the reason why I quit concert security.

724
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.430
I was working as a security guard and great woods.

725
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:55.721
Oh,

726
00:23:55.721 --> 00:24:00.721
all the people that did a martial arts with me all got security jobs and this

727
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:02.150
place,

728
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.350
and I got a job there too.

729
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.760
And during a Neil young concert is a place called great woods.

730
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.450
And Greg Woods is an amphitheater.

731
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.440
So there's a,

732
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.450
there's covered seating and then the back,

733
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.150
the cheaper seats are this lawn area.

734
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.790
And in the lawn area it got a little chilly.

735
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.880
So dude start fires and the security guards had to go in and shut down the fires

736
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.420
and riots broke out and people start punching people and it got crazy.

737
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.050
And I'm like,

738
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.490
fuck doing security.

739
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.820
<v 1>Well,</v>

740
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.150
I quit in the middle of a Neil young concert.

741
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:36.070
I put a Hoodie on over my security jacket and I fucking bail.

742
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.311
Yes,

743
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:37.960
I did.

744
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.450
Good.

745
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.931
I was like,

746
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:39.261
dude,

747
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:44.261
I'm not fucking getting my ass kicked or getting stabbed for Neil Young Neil

748
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:46.040
young fans.

749
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:48.810
He told me that bringing it back,

750
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.880
he told me that story in BC.

751
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:50.471
That's why I want to do,

752
00:24:50.471 --> 00:24:51.440
it was crazy.

753
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.640
There was fires,

754
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:56.870
people are lighting fires and when one guy saw far as a shit I want to farm.

755
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:02.190
And then all these Neil young fans just starting fires we're talking about,

756
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.500
I mean I don't know how many

757
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:03.941
<v 3>people,</v>

758
00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:05.620
Great Woods in Mansfield,

759
00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:06.910
Massachusetts seats.

760
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.170
I got to think it's somewhere in the,

761
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.600
it's,

762
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:08.871
you know,

763
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:10.690
it's a big ass concert place.

764
00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:15.130
Like I saw Sam Kennison there and Bon Jovi's like 15,000 seats.

765
00:25:15.131 --> 00:25:17.740
So you know for sure thousand

766
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.640
<v 1>of them were on fire.</v>

767
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.230
It was fucking crazy remodel.

768
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.081
I mean this is like,

769
00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:25.930
I was 19 so this is like 86 and you know,

770
00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:27.130
young fans are crazy.

771
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.341
Hey,

772
00:25:27.341 --> 00:25:28.750
chow is nuts man.

773
00:25:28.751 --> 00:25:29.261
It was all year.

774
00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.460
That needle and the damage done.

775
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.440
<v 2>Oh southern man,</v>

776
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:37.950
<v 1>that was to make a fire.</v>

777
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.640
It was dark man.

778
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.421
It got crazy.

779
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.830
I fucking bailed out of there.

780
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.880
A lot of people don't know.

781
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.580
I used to be a fireman when I worked at Matthews.

782
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.533
You were a fireman,

783
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.853
Forrest Gump.

784
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.140
A lot of people don't know.

785
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:51.560
He said,

786
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.393
oh Lord,

787
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.730
no,

788
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.563
Forrest Gump.

789
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.053
Forrest Gump.

790
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:56.983
Yeah.

791
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.720
Every time I need a happy movie.

792
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.190
Which a story like you cause like super slow but really good at ping pong.

793
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.150
I was environment superstar and uh,

794
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.233
<v 2>yeah,</v>

795
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.770
<v 3>we went on this fire call with this lady and man her house.</v>

796
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.990
The problem with the thing that you encounter a lot as firemen and she'd go on

797
00:26:22.991 --> 00:26:27.991
fire calls where a lot of the houses are not kept up at the level that most

798
00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:31.300
people would keep them up.

799
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.910
I guess that's politically correct way to say it.

800
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.020
Corridors hoarders.

801
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.943
Yeah,

802
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.830
let's just go.

803
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.460
So I went on this link.

804
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.330
<v 2>I shouldn't say no visual scrapers.</v>

805
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.570
<v 1>I guess I picked the wrong time to store gasoline in the bathroom</v>

806
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.010
and I mean,

807
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.440
I wouldn't have classified her as a hoarder.

808
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.190
I would,

809
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.530
I would classify more as a cat lady,

810
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.100
but she had a vast collection of,

811
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.993
uh,

812
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.500
let's kneel tapes.

813
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.430
Oh,

814
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.560
I remember a track or cassette

815
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.620
cassette collection along with a lot of cats and cat turds.

816
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:19.923
She have

817
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.260
not as many as the city of Lanai.

818
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:27.661
Well,

819
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:29.280
we went to cat sanctuary.

820
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:31.620
Out here is 500 cats.

821
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.090
There's a cat sanctuary cage.

822
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.800
How you guys do other things besides hunting?

823
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.730
I've family,

824
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:41.603
Bro.

825
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.020
When you have little girls,

826
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.370
we have to do other shit.

827
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.240
You have to.

828
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.970
This is the only way I could balance this trip out.

829
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.220
I have to do a con game.

830
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.140
I have to say I know your family to

831
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.010
Hawaii.

832
00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:57.844
Yay.

833
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.800
Where's Daddy?

834
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.221
Oh,

835
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:00.390
he's murdering animals.

836
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.810
Like Shane's anxiety level when he's not hunting is off the charts.

837
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.500
Super tense.

838
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.870
We were

839
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.043
really added.

840
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.831
<v 3>Well,</v>

841
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:18.820
it's so drying off here dudes.

842
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.120
Whoa,

843
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.281
Whoa,

844
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:19.461
Whoa,

845
00:28:19.461 --> 00:28:19.651
Whoa,

846
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:19.891
whoa.

847
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:21.880
You point red bull and your wine.

848
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:31.190
<v 1>[inaudible] is red bull and wine might be a first.</v>

849
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.413
What do you,

850
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.730
what do you call that trash bag?

851
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.520
It's a new concoction.

852
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.880
Let's call this the Cat Lady [inaudible] and I've created it catch before,

853
00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:51.160
but that you guys created ride brain,

854
00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:53.830
which is a combination of Alpha brain and whiskey.

855
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.300
Now standing these,

856
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:55.920
serve that,

857
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.070
but drinking everywhere.

858
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.630
Back when he was a bartender

859
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.850
before the farmer,

860
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.010
the bartending me and Sharon

861
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.790
bartending thing at the trigger,

862
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.340
like national convention in Salt Lake.

863
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:12.940
Yup.

864
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.540
We did a,

865
00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.200
uh,

866
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.320
we did a smoked grapefruit.

867
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.230
Tom Collins,

868
00:29:17.231 --> 00:29:18.160
that fricking one.

869
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.010
Well this is something that you do two

870
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.150
<v 3>that I have not tried,</v>

871
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:23.580
but I do want to try John Dudley.

872
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.440
We'll take a bucket of water.

873
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.830
Yeah.

874
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.820
He will smoke as balls.

875
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.530
He takes a bucket of water.

876
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.131
He puts it.

877
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:29.241
I'm,

878
00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:29.601
I'm not,

879
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:30.410
I'm not joking.

880
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:31.590
It takes a bucket of water,

881
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:32.620
puts it in the triggers,

882
00:29:32.621 --> 00:29:34.890
smokes the water right.

883
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.390
Then takes that water,

884
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:38.410
pours it into these um,

885
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.121
ball,

886
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:39.750
uh,

887
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.320
ice ball holders.

888
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.154
What do you call those things?

889
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.833
<v 1>Silicone.</v>

890
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.830
Eisman yeah.

891
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:45.700
Will you make a ball?

892
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.880
You make a whiskey bar.

893
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.560
Whiskey bar.

894
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.393
You can smoke,

895
00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.220
<v 4>you can smoke water with like mesquite or apple,</v>

896
00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.490
apple flavored pellets or anything you want.

897
00:29:55.491 --> 00:29:57.380
And then you freeze them.

898
00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.540
And if you have a crappy bourbon,

899
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.730
you can drop that ice,

900
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:06.830
the smoked ice ball in and you can take a real like crappy bourbon and make it

901
00:30:06.921 --> 00:30:07.580
decent.

902
00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.090
That's it.

903
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.290
I'm ordering or trigger tomorrow.

904
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.780
<v 3>I'm a crappy bourbon drinker.</v>

905
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:14.350
I mean Jack Daniels considered a crappy bourbon,

906
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:15.340
but what does that considered?

907
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.670
<v 4>We might get shot if we say that.</v>

908
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.620
I would say more like anything under seven bucks a bottle.

909
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.380
<v 1>[inaudible] from a guy who's drinking tequila and wine and [inaudible] cat lady.</v>

910
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.430
Gentleman.

911
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.000
I like it.

912
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.940
I'm not sure that he's mixed.

913
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:40.621
Ology is what?

914
00:30:40.621 --> 00:30:41.010
Right.

915
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.080
We just fucked up my mini bar by the way.

916
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.680
[inaudible] and ears.

917
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.060
Radical bear hugs verse a booze.

918
00:30:48.061 --> 00:30:49.470
When my family comes back here,

919
00:30:49.471 --> 00:30:50.000
I'm going to happen.

920
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.940
<v 3>Fucking some really shitty look.</v>

921
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.190
<v 1>Well Cause Ron would be laying on the floor.</v>

922
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.410
Maybe they're my friends.

923
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:56.960
They're family.

924
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.793
You got to let it go.

925
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:02.920
You got to let it go.

926
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:03.754
These guys are,

927
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.780
they're all killers.

928
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.003
They've killed tank.

929
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.830
<v 3>Let them,</v>

930
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.490
they need to blow off some steam.

931
00:31:08.491 --> 00:31:09.630
They got PTSD

932
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.270
from rage.

933
00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:13.540
Tried pan ladies.

934
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.393
Excellent.

935
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.600
It's a very good drink,

936
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.520
Shane.

937
00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.370
I'll try the cat lady.

938
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.791
Come on,

939
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:22.470
man,

940
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.303
I need,

941
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.420
I'm a little bit of leeway.

942
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.770
You don't like the Cat lady.

943
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.540
I'm missing up deer as it goes.

944
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:27.871
Oh,

945
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:28.290
okay.

946
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.123
Wait,

947
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.083
listen.

948
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.230
<v 1>And that ladies is pretty good.</v>

949
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:36.270
It's good.

950
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.860
It's a strange cacophony of like

951
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.790
anytime you could say coffee on a podcast,

952
00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:44.190
you win and that's when you're in drinking tequila,

953
00:31:44.191 --> 00:31:45.024
wine and red bull.

954
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.250
If

955
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.030
<v 3>stuff comes out.</v>

956
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.310
Let's talk about how God damn fast,

957
00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:49.144
these deer,

958
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.980
I killed one and I killed one because he didn't know I was there.

959
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.390
Every deer that saw me and he stood still and I shot an Arrow at him.

960
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.380
They duct that motherfucker like neo on the matrix.

961
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.550
I mean,

962
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:08.550
it was so amazing watching an Arrow going and I switched arrows because John

963
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.440
Dudley made me two builds.

964
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:12.271
He made me an arrow.

965
00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:16.660
Bill was 625 grain arrows that go 245 feet a second,

966
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.960
and then 496 four 96 and four 93 86 thought it was five to 16 the lighter ones,

967
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.930
I think they're four 96 anyway there,

968
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.940
they're still fairly heavy,

969
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.550
but they go 275 feet per second.

970
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.580
I switched to the 275 feet per second arrows because these these deer with see

971
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.290
the Arrow coming out and be like,

972
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:42.560
bitch and just not even come close.

973
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.570
So with the 275 feet per second arrows,

974
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.400
I was catching hairs.

975
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.150
I got a couple of hairs when they were looking at me like I would like get the

976
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:53.571
air on.

977
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:54.170
I'd look at it as,

978
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.291
oh,

979
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.340
there's a hair on this arrow.

980
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.260
Or I literally would give them a haircut,

981
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.123
no blood.

982
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.400
They would just duck under it and it would just like catch the,

983
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.400
like the top of their head or the smaller back or something.

984
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.610
<v 4>So we need to get you like a 380 grand arrow.</v>

985
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:07.410
So no,

986
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:07.790
no,

987
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.623
no.

988
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.450
<v 5>I'm gonna meet this,</v>

989
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.813
I actually did it

990
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.950
<v 4>gas with a winky about this and we did a whole,</v>

991
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.270
I mean we talked for a long time about speed versus energy.

992
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.700
He's a big speed guy,

993
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.151
you know,

994
00:33:22.151 --> 00:33:25.860
he for Aero Ducker's he explained to Wiki is to the people that will see,

995
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.290
he is a whitetail expert,

996
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.970
a whitetail deer expertise.

997
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.800
You know,

998
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.650
a very,

999
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.160
very well known editor or a writer and he's got a great,

1000
00:33:38.561 --> 00:33:39.394
uh,

1001
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.130
I guess online webisodes semi live on hunting show.

1002
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.770
Yeah.

1003
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.660
Midwest White Dale.

1004
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:45.921
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:48.080
I feel like the world of hunting very well.

1006
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:48.990
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.390
And we had this ongoing debate,

1008
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:55.560
which is really cool because when I have a lot of my guests on my podcast,

1009
00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.600
I like to get in and things to where it interests me because it's a lot like

1010
00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:00.931
you,

1011
00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:01.764
there's,

1012
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.300
I wouldn't say argument,

1013
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.680
but there's debate between this and you know,

1014
00:34:07.681 --> 00:34:10.230
a versus B and bills.

1015
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.430
He's very successful and he has a very good following and he is a very valid

1016
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.353
opinion.

1017
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:20.630
But his opinion on an Arrow having a lot of speed in order to avoid an dear

1018
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.650
dropping versus like say Adam Green Trees,

1019
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.590
opinion of having just a super efficient,

1020
00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:36.591
very heavy Arrow that is maximum penetration to where regardless of what it

1021
00:34:37.441 --> 00:34:37.950
hits,

1022
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.090
it's going to do its job.

1023
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.800
<v 3>And by dropping what we mean is when,</v>

1024
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.440
what today is a perfect example,

1025
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.180
the deer here,

1026
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:48.960
the sound trigger in the night lanai in particular,

1027
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.120
the deer hear the sound of a,

1028
00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:54.090
a bow launching an Arrow and they bolt.

1029
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.130
Ben and I were talking,

1030
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.930
I mean talking like this,

1031
00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.800
we were just talking,

1032
00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.820
we're shooting the shit and there was at least two bucks,

1033
00:35:02.821 --> 00:35:07.740
two bucks and a couple of dos bedded less than 20 yards away from us and they

1034
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:08.820
weren't even reacting.

1035
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.900
And then I took,

1036
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.171
I'm like,

1037
00:35:10.171 --> 00:35:11.040
should I take this bottle?

1038
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.810
I should launch this bomb on this dope

1039
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:15.640
<v 5>and,</v>

1040
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.210
and he gives me a reason to go 70 yards.

1041
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:17.481
I'm like,

1042
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:18.021
fuck it up,

1043
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:18.854
I'm going to go with this.

1044
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.930
So I dropped back 70 yards and did the dough is really like,

1045
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:24.290
bitch,

1046
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.160
are you serious?

1047
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.733
She's,

1048
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.370
she slides to the left.

1049
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.080
<v 3>It's like she's in something like 1990s fucking break dancing.</v>

1050
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.640
<v 5>If he was electric slide,</v>

1051
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.280
I got to have no shot exactly

1052
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.440
<v 3>where she was standing and she was nowhere.</v>

1053
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.510
I told you after that

1054
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.570
<v 4>like you hit exactly where you were aiming in the tendering that Deere was</v>

1055
00:35:47.571 --> 00:35:49.070
swimming the Maui before.

1056
00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:50.480
You're so fast.

1057
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.480
They're so fast.

1058
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.810
I was like at 70 yards.

1059
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.310
If they're looking at you and they're,

1060
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.240
they react.

1061
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.640
It's not like you're missing them by inches or millimeters.

1062
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.110
They could be like feet,

1063
00:36:00.111 --> 00:36:00.944
six feet.

1064
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.830
UFC fighters had the instincts of an axis.

1065
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.630
You an enviable,

1066
00:36:08.631 --> 00:36:10.480
you'd have to watch it in slow motion.

1067
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.780
Know what the hell went on.

1068
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.673
<v 3>Mighty mouse,</v>

1069
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.120
Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson.

1070
00:36:14.121 --> 00:36:17.030
The best pound for pound fighter in the world might as well be an axis deer.

1071
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1072
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.051
<v 3>For Real.</v>

1073
00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:26.210
I mean that's like literally what we talking about.

1074
00:36:26.211 --> 00:36:28.400
Like people who fight mighty mouse,

1075
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.240
they probably feel like a dude who shooting and an access steer who's looking

1076
00:36:32.241 --> 00:36:33.074
right at them.

1077
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:34.663
No chance.

1078
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.980
But for bow hunting,

1079
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.700
it is probably the best training you could ever have.

1080
00:36:40.701 --> 00:36:43.490
And we were talking about this because this whole thing was put together.

1081
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.810
Shout out to Yeti coolers,

1082
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.280
greatest coolers on the planet earth.

1083
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.630
Ben O'brien,

1084
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.220
a big EXEC at Yeti coolers.

1085
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.820
This,

1086
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.360
this whole thing was whatever the fuck his coordinator,

1087
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.393
homeboy,

1088
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.240
um,

1089
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:56.631
this,

1090
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:56.961
this,

1091
00:36:56.961 --> 00:36:58.790
this whole thing was put together.

1092
00:36:58.791 --> 00:36:59.480
And while,

1093
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.291
while we're here,

1094
00:37:00.291 --> 00:37:05.150
we were thinking like this might be the ultimate destination for bow hunters to

1095
00:37:05.151 --> 00:37:05.890
prepare for

1096
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.610
<v 4>any other hunt.</v>

1097
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.443
Yeah,

1098
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.000
yeah.

1099
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.520
You get to experience at all.

1100
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.990
You get their experience spotting,

1101
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.853
stock,

1102
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.860
a diversity of terrain,

1103
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:20.260
and then in the end you have a lot of opportunity and animals that don't let you

1104
00:37:20.261 --> 00:37:21.094
fuck up.

1105
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.233
Yeah.

1106
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.120
If you do like 15 minutes later you had another group.

1107
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:25.550
<v 3>Right.</v>

1108
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.450
That's the beautiful thing.

1109
00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:28.670
It's amazing training opportunity.

1110
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.600
So bill winkies debate speed versus,

1111
00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:36.380
so the drop means the deer hear the sound of an Arrow,

1112
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:37.214
which is like,

1113
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.590
they hear the sound of a bow going off and they,

1114
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.230
they,

1115
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.110
they literally duct out not duck cause they think an Arrow's coming,

1116
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.830
they'd duct because they're preparing to lower themselves then launched

1117
00:37:48.831 --> 00:37:49.610
themselves forward.

1118
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.020
Yeah.

1119
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.381
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:53.570
A lot of times people think they're ducking the arrow.

1121
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.530
But what happens is when someone gets scared,

1122
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.510
it's a lot like Sharon,

1123
00:37:58.511 --> 00:38:00.370
my wife is bad about this.

1124
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.900
I'll come around the corner and be like,

1125
00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:02.734
hey

1126
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.730
yeah,

1127
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:05.563
and ducks,

1128
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.990
<v 2>so string it [inaudible] you're jumping this tray.</v>

1129
00:38:15.651 --> 00:38:17.150
I'm just trying to say hi.

1130
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.730
<v 4>She's a strange jumper.</v>

1131
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:20.763
Um,

1132
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.770
what happens is the deer,

1133
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.930
they just pick their legs off the ground.

1134
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.310
And that's the cool thing about videos is when you video your hunts,

1135
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:31.710
you actually get to relive those funds again.

1136
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.600
You can slow him down and watch him.

1137
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.980
And really,

1138
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.471
you know,

1139
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:37.420
it's a reaction of they're just clenching up.

1140
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:39.160
So they're lifting their feet off the ground.

1141
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:42.490
So gravity is dropping depending on their body weight,

1142
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.860
it's dropping him at asserting certain speeds.

1143
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.171
<v 3>Oh.</v>

1144
00:38:45.171 --> 00:38:47.600
So the lifting their feet so that they can go forward

1145
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.320
<v 4>picking up as a reaction like ah,</v>

1146
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.360
and then once they spraying they're going,

1147
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:54.990
but,

1148
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.770
but the weight of their body is actually dropping that down.

1149
00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.633
So,

1150
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.720
you know,

1151
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.650
like with an elk,

1152
00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:05.430
obviously it's a lot more mass so they'll drop at a faster rate than something

1153
00:39:05.431 --> 00:39:06.264
that's lighter.

1154
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.720
But a lot of times their legs are just coming up to the body and the gravity is

1155
00:39:12.211 --> 00:39:13.320
pulling them down.

1156
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.990
<v 3>So what is a bill winkies philosophy?</v>

1157
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:21.350
<v 4>He really thinks speed is a more of a benefit than momentum or kinetic energy.</v>

1158
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:28.340
But in saying that bill is also very focused on a medium game animal.

1159
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.020
So when we talk about,

1160
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:31.741
you know,

1161
00:39:31.741 --> 00:39:35.100
a whitetail deer is a lot different than the elk or a moose.

1162
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.990
So you know,

1163
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.020
momentum for which is a heavier Arrow traveling and maybe at a slower way to

1164
00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:45.630
speed but delivers a lot more energy.

1165
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.150
It's a lot like when form and he used to fight,

1166
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:48.691
you know,

1167
00:39:48.691 --> 00:39:51.900
when I watched foreman or when I watch a lot of his older fights,

1168
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.840
he never looked like he was hitting anyone hard.

1169
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.270
But when his glove hit someone,

1170
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:02.690
their whole body was taking a tremendous amount of energy because it was a big

1171
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:05.550
freaking fists.

1172
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.010
<v 3>You know,</v>

1173
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.430
why aren't you,

1174
00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:07.691
you,

1175
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:07.961
you,

1176
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:09.640
you feel like he wasn't hitting hard.

1177
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:13.660
Cause you weren't there because something that's lost in film.

1178
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.890
Like there's a lot of people that I've seen hit people and person and they just

1179
00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:18.310
have,

1180
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:18.700
there's,

1181
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.270
there's people that are built weird and George form is a perfect example.

1182
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.860
George Foreman is a guy,

1183
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:24.970
I've never met him personally,

1184
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.350
but he has hands that are the size of canned hams there.

1185
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:30.840
They're fucking enormous.

1186
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:34.090
It was a bigger Lesnar's probably in the neighbor.

1187
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.790
Brock Lesnar could have been.

1188
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.470
He's a freak.

1189
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.580
He could have been the greatest heavyweight of all time if he was fully

1190
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:43.151
dedicated.

1191
00:40:43.151 --> 00:40:48.151
And he started from the time he was in high school and went straight into MMA.

1192
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.770
But he spent so much time in pro wrestling.

1193
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:52.690
But if you look at Brock Lesnar's,

1194
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:53.524
Columbine,

1195
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.513
Columbine,

1196
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.370
hello cat lady.

1197
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.850
You look at Brock Lesnar's combine numbers,

1198
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:02.320
his NFL combine numbers,

1199
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.130
they're insane.

1200
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.500
He bench press 225 pounds,

1201
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:10.270
something like 45 reps is fucking vertical is off the roof.

1202
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.340
His long jump is insane.

1203
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.140
For a guy who's almost 300 pounds,

1204
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.130
he's a freak.

1205
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:15.431
I've,

1206
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:16.390
I've never,

1207
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.700
I've seen a lot of athletic creeks.

1208
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.820
I've never seen anybody more freaky than Brock Lesnar.

1209
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.040
But that freaky athleticism.

1210
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:29.070
What's beautiful about MMA that freaky athleticism does not overcome technique

1211
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.040
and longterm training in,

1212
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.250
in the particular disciplines of MMA.

1213
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.860
That's why Cain Velasquez beat the shit out of him.

1214
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.390
Whereas Cain Velasquez,

1215
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:39.590
he's a freak too,

1216
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.910
but he's a cardio freak.

1217
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.990
Different kinds of freak.

1218
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.780
Not a power look like yet.

1219
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.773
Exactly.

1220
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.460
But it's in one of those things.

1221
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:47.480
You've got to be there to see him.

1222
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.000
If you saw Cain Velasquez fight in person,

1223
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:52.810
you'd say Jesus Christ wave.

1224
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.780
But it doesn't matter.

1225
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.320
But he's got a mind like it does though.

1226
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.560
When you hit someone wrinkles.

1227
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:00.050
Yeah,

1228
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.130
for ages.

1229
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.570
He's got a mind.

1230
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.440
Cain Velasquez has got a mind and uh,

1231
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.280
like his lungs,

1232
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.233
like lungs.

1233
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.720
One of the things they say about hunting is that what kills animals,

1234
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:13.010
his legs and lungs.

1235
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.990
Elk especially cause like being able to get to where the elk are.

1236
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.800
Being able to like being able to like have the cardio.

1237
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:22.581
So it's like,

1238
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:23.200
it's not an,

1239
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.200
it's not like a coincidence that a guy like Cam Hanes became a psychopathic

1240
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:32.300
endurance athlete because he's obsessed with elk hunting.

1241
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.373
I mean,

1242
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.490
I talked to him about it.

1243
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:34.910
He's like,

1244
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:39.050
the whole thing with me was I had to figure out how to get to those elk.

1245
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:39.741
You know,

1246
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:41.090
like how do I get to those suck?

1247
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:41.751
I'm tired.

1248
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:42.800
Like how do I not be tired?

1249
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:43.634
I got to start running.

1250
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:47.420
How do I get more endurance while I gotta run longer?

1251
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:49.100
I've got to learn harder to run hills.

1252
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.420
I've got to run mountains.

1253
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.520
And it's the same thing with,

1254
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:53.354
with fighting.

1255
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.540
Like if you're like an explosive,

1256
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.670
super fast athlete,

1257
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:00.290
but you run out of gas,

1258
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:00.800
you're,

1259
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.700
you're fucked.

1260
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.271
You know,

1261
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:05.330
like you have this short window of time to get the job done.

1262
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.330
And if the guy who you're fighting could survive that storm,

1263
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.980
you're kind of fucked,

1264
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:10.701
you know,

1265
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:12.770
because then you don't have any gas left.

1266
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:13.790
And that's Brock Lesnar.

1267
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.970
Brock Lesnar never really developed into the type of like fully evolved MMA

1268
00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:20.720
fighter.

1269
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.700
But what he did have his,

1270
00:43:21.701 --> 00:43:23.690
his freak athletic body.

1271
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.280
That's the same thing with George Foreman.

1272
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.350
If you watch that rumble in the jungle,

1273
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.610
George Foreman came out of the gate storming hit Mohammed.

1274
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.000
I leave with these body shots,

1275
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.200
even a better fight,

1276
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:38.201
his watch George form of versus Joe Frazier where he literally picks him up with

1277
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:39.290
shots.

1278
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.700
He hits him and you see Joe Frazier,

1279
00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:46.520
his body go up in the air from getting hit because form was so powerful.

1280
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.750
But Mohammed Ali was skillful enough so when the punches were hitting him,

1281
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.540
he was sliding just a little bit out of the way,

1282
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.100
just a little bit out of the way with each punch absorbing them but moving with

1283
00:43:58.101 --> 00:43:58.341
them.

1284
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:00.410
So it took a lot of the energy away from them.

1285
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.770
And I think that that's a lie.

1286
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.870
You could say this is,

1287
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.793
this is like,

1288
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.030
this is like a,

1289
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:10.940
an analogy to like arrows and and,

1290
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.250
and,

1291
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.040
and a heavyweight era,

1292
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.310
which goes slower or a fast Arrow,

1293
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.200
which doesn't have as much momentum,

1294
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.760
doesn't have as much kinetic energy,

1295
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:20.500
but it's quicker.

1296
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:20.780
It gets,

1297
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.440
if they both connect on point a at the same time,

1298
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.990
foreman is definitely doing more damage.

1299
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.500
Sure.

1300
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.200
So if you have mighty mouse versus George Foreman,

1301
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.580
<v 5>this is at a certain point in time.</v>

1302
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.070
I got a bet on George Foreman.

1303
00:44:36.071 --> 00:44:38.050
I mean until we get to like

1304
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.290
<v 4>what are you looking for?</v>

1305
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.980
More cat laid more red bull.

1306
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:42.350
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1307
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.740
red bull calf ladies.

1308
00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.170
Here's another refrigerator in the other room

1309
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.743
<v 7>here.</v>

1310
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.220
Well here for sure.

1311
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:52.100
Like that air of comparison is,

1312
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:52.520
and we,

1313
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.030
we were shooting just today and we were just messing around and talking and we

1314
00:44:57.031 --> 00:44:58.560
decided to shoot this tree just to see.

1315
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.041
Yeah,

1316
00:44:59.041 --> 00:44:59.960
that's a perfect example.

1317
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.813
The tree.

1318
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.530
So Joe is pulling the side,

1319
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.320
80 86 pages,

1320
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:05.700
six pounds and his airways.

1321
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.061
How many,

1322
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:06.580
what's the grain?

1323
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.040
Somewhere around 500 grains.

1324
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:08.903
That's a heavier,

1325
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:09.661
my,

1326
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:11.300
I'm shooting 68 pounds of my,

1327
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.790
my Arrow was 320 grant.

1328
00:45:12.791 --> 00:45:17.470
So roughly half a weight and much less drawl.

1329
00:45:17.471 --> 00:45:18.304
He did you,

1330
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.290
he shoots this tree dead center does his thing and his broad,

1331
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:25.020
it sticks right in the center of this tree and the era of stays in the broadhead

1332
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.860
disappears.

1333
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.611
I brought in a disappears.

1334
00:45:26.611 --> 00:45:28.290
It goes right up right into the insert.

1335
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:28.860
Yeah,

1336
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:29.550
I shoot the tree,

1337
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.000
my Arab to flex off the side of the tree and the Brown had the side of the

1338
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:33.360
broader,

1339
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.680
the third blade and brought it,

1340
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:35.790
gets stuck in a branch

1341
00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:36.741
<v 4>and then he looks at me.</v>

1342
00:45:36.741 --> 00:45:37.574
He goes,

1343
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:38.493
have your Arrow

1344
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.740
<v 5>[inaudible] chasse arrows?</v>

1345
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:45.583
Yes.

1346
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.350
<v 4>Well I mean that's what you would've had Miley Miley Cyrus</v>

1347
00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:55.350
<v 5>is the name that John totally game to my 625 green Arrow set up,</v>

1348
00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.630
which it goes slower but it does horrendous damage.

1349
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.303
<v 1>Joe sent me</v>

1350
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.011
<v 4>and he said,</v>

1351
00:46:06.011 --> 00:46:06.844
dude,

1352
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.910
build me something fricking extreme.

1353
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.320
<v 5>We just had a conversation.</v>

1354
00:46:11.321 --> 00:46:12.154
We were trying,

1355
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:17.160
<v 1>we're just trying to figure out like I actually downloaded a gift,</v>

1356
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.930
a gift file of virus.

1357
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.880
Miley Cyrus on the wrecking ball,

1358
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.360
85 yards

1359
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.540
<v 4>at my house.</v>

1360
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.500
And when air,

1361
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.050
when his Arrow would hit my target,

1362
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.340
the next time I would shoot Google model all I can see elk horns moving on my

1363
00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:41.590
target because it was still shaking from the Arrow that I shot before it.

1364
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:41.980
Wow.

1365
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.820
So when Joe said,

1366
00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:43.570
dude,

1367
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:44.950
how's that set up doing?

1368
00:46:44.951 --> 00:46:45.784
Cause I had told,

1369
00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.570
actually we,

1370
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.850
I built like three different options,

1371
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:50.111
but I told him,

1372
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:50.441
I said,

1373
00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:51.190
man,

1374
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:55.990
this thing is hitting like her freaking wrecking ball because the target would

1375
00:46:55.991 --> 00:46:59.800
just shake and by the time I drew back again and wouldn't be aiming for the

1376
00:46:59.801 --> 00:47:00.634
second Arrow,

1377
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.420
I could still see the horns moving from the first arrow.

1378
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:05.110
Yeah.

1379
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.530
<v 1>So then I ended up downloading a Gif,</v>

1380
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.020
Miley Cyrus riding that wrecking ball back and go over there and I said,

1381
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.040
this is what it sounds like on the drawl cycles,

1382
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:27.243
the limbs

1383
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.110
<v 2>pulling back this Lincoln log,</v>

1384
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.200
all these tiles.

1385
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.200
That's an accident when the arrows on play,

1386
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.410
a bunch of Google.

1387
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.923
All right,

1388
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.620
<v 1>need Photoshop work of Joe Rogan</v>

1389
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.110
<v 2>stat on Miley Cyrus</v>

1390
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.490
right now vegans are crying.

1391
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.280
<v 1>This is no calming.</v>

1392
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.481
It's not a,

1393
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:02.121
it's not a good day.

1394
00:48:02.121 --> 00:48:02.400
And why?

1395
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.050
Unless you're drinking a cat lady and listen to Miley.

1396
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:04.903
So

1397
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.920
whoever on that fifth year,

1398
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.840
I brought five extra hours.

1399
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:15.841
Today I have a seven Arrow tight spot and I brought a five Arrow extra quiver

1400
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.631
was,

1401
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:16.991
I'm like,

1402
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:18.070
today's my last day.

1403
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:18.551
We're going,

1404
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:20.290
how many girls did you bring on this trip?

1405
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:20.680
Joe?

1406
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.513
50

1407
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.080
might be some kind of a record.

1408
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.850
Farrell came off from that guy.

1409
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.210
Let me,

1410
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.480
we must clarify this when when Joe says training,

1411
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.470
we're not training.

1412
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:35.820
When these animals were talking about the training of spotting an animal stuff

1413
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.300
and in making,

1414
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.470
making what isn't efficient shot like it's,

1415
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.930
it's a very ethical practice,

1416
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:44.920
but training just means like opportunity after opportunity after opportunity,

1417
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.370
meaning that you could get after these animals and learn how they move,

1418
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:49.040
how you move,

1419
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.000
how you won't be quiet.

1420
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.240
Dark window.

1421
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.500
Drawls just practice mentor

1422
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.510
<v 4>day of hunting here.</v>

1423
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.060
I mean you have more opportunities on spot and stocks.

1424
00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:02.010
Then the majority of guys are going to have an entire hunting trip on

1425
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.970
<v 1>maybe a season,</v>

1426
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:03.803
maybe

1427
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.751
mule deer,

1428
00:49:05.751 --> 00:49:06.110
elk,

1429
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:06.920
anything like that.

1430
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.020
I think I have to soul man the first day,

1431
00:49:09.021 --> 00:49:13.470
which we will talk about island time and a little bit first day seeing signoff,

1432
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:15.980
talking about an island time.

1433
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.430
Listen,

1434
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.390
they got it right.

1435
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:18.740
You're an island boy.

1436
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.090
You guys got it right.

1437
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.980
This is the way to live.

1438
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.330
The way I live is bullshit.

1439
00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.390
It's bullshit.

1440
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.141
He,

1441
00:49:27.141 --> 00:49:27.441
oh,

1442
00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:30.860
everybody's off fucking nervous and worrying and stress.

1443
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.551
I come here,

1444
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:31.850
I'm like,

1445
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.290
I'm so relaxed.

1446
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.490
My kids are relaxed.

1447
00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:35.450
My wife's relaxed.

1448
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.871
I'm like,

1449
00:49:35.871 --> 00:49:36.740
we're so relaxed.

1450
00:49:36.741 --> 00:49:37.130
Like,

1451
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.311
Hey,

1452
00:49:37.311 --> 00:49:37.910
wait a minute.

1453
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.800
Why shouldn't we just be relaxed?

1454
00:49:39.801 --> 00:49:40.340
Yeah.

1455
00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.050
It's one of these last 40 hours,

1456
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.730
right?

1457
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:43.640
It's Friday.

1458
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:44.533
And we got,

1459
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.330
we got here Monday and it's Friday,

1460
00:49:47.331 --> 00:49:48.650
and all of us were saying the other day,

1461
00:49:48.651 --> 00:49:49.484
we feel like

1462
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.640
when I go into my son's going to be like 17 years.

1463
00:49:55.670 --> 00:50:00.110
Shut off the Trager first shipping of fucking grill.

1464
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.020
Oh yeah.

1465
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:01.873
Happy Birthday.

1466
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.300
Yeah.

1467
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:04.160
Tyler.

1468
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:04.401
Yeah.

1469
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.360
Happy Birthday.

1470
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:06.590
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1471
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:07.400

1473

1474
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.730
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1475
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.330
Chad Warren at whiskey bent barbecue and his Instagram.

1476
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.220
He everything.

1477
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:17.611
Well,

1478
00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:21.180
we didn't have the chance to reverse your last night because we were actually

1479
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.300
trying to just chill out on the beach,

1480
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.440
but we ended up,

1481
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.040
we could then Rameys

1482
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.640
<v 7>move la backstraps because in a move line,</v>

1483
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:35.000

1484
00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:35.540
Yeah.

1485
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.470
MMM.

Miss Maya.

1490
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:49.623
A little bit.

1491
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:50.230
Continue.

1492
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.561
By the way.

1493
00:50:50.561 --> 00:50:54.040
I've never listened to that song before you sent me that anime.

1494
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.390
I knew she wrote that song,

1495
00:50:55.391 --> 00:50:56.224
but I really,

1496
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:57.490
I don't even know if she wrote it.

1497
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.353
She sang it.

1498
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.430
<v 2>Miley Cyrus,</v>

1499
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.430
she said more and more press time.

1500
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:08.970
<v 5>Yes.</v>

1501
00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:09.920
I'm a big fan.

1502
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:10.310
Did,

1503
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.320
I don't know what you're talking about

1504
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.530
Cyrus.

1505
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:15.363
The last night though,

1506
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.250
<v 7>everything he made was super legit and I was blown away at how I've eaten a lot</v>

1507
00:51:21.251 --> 00:51:21.591
of move on.

1508
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:22.150
It's actually,

1509
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:26.860
but I was blown away by like that side by side comparison can move on.

1510
00:51:26.861 --> 00:51:28.540
She'd compared to the axis deer and it was,

1511
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.681
I was reading,

1512
00:51:29.681 --> 00:51:31.090
I was devastated.

1513
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:31.720
I was,

1514
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.553
<v 2>I actually,</v>

1515
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.820
<v 5>it was true because let's,</v>

1516
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:42.430
<v 7>what's Kinda sucks about this whole trip is I wanted,</v>

1517
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.990
the one thing I really wanted to shoot was a move Flon on Hawaii.

1518
00:51:46.991 --> 00:51:47.800
Sorry.

1519
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.470
Shane's playing my little violin as faces.

1520
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.913
Um,

1521
00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:57.490
I hadn't had a lot of opportunities to shoot bouffant in states that didn't have

1522
00:51:57.491 --> 00:51:58.271
native move.

1523
00:51:58.271 --> 00:51:59.440
Lon and I always said,

1524
00:51:59.441 --> 00:52:00.820
if I want to shoot a move on,

1525
00:52:00.821 --> 00:52:02.680
I really want to shoot it in Hawaii.

1526
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:03.970
Um,

1527
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.720
just because that's me as a hunter and your free ranging.

1528
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.560
Right.

1529
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.730
And I had asked the guy if they had move on and he said,

1530
00:52:12.731 --> 00:52:13.540
well,

1531
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.081
yeah,

1532
00:52:14.081 --> 00:52:15.910
but it's really tough to get up there.

1533
00:52:15.911 --> 00:52:17.380
And little did I know that.

1534
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:17.981
Meanwhile,

1535
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:22.981
Ben and Randy Warren had secretly arrange the hunt up and move on to your story,

1536
00:52:25.721 --> 00:52:30.721
which literally looked like New Zealand and they went up and I can't believe you

1537
00:52:31.841 --> 00:52:32.441
got to.

1538
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:33.220
That's amazing.

1539
00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:33.550
We got,

1540
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.960
we would have had more than two.

1541
00:52:34.961 --> 00:52:36.700
I missed one at 30 yards.

1542
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.743
A good one.

1543
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:38.370
Good one.

1544
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:39.100
Giant one.

1545
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.540
You needed a faster era.

1546
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.140
I needed,

1547
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.410
I needed a sword for them.

1548
00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:43.740
<v 5>Well what do you,</v>

1549
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.011
you know,

1550
00:52:44.011 --> 00:52:45.180
you needed a mighty mouse.

1551
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:45.501
I need him.

1552
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:46.290
I needed him.

1553
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:47.350
So what do you,

1554
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:49.440
this whole thing about bill winky,

1555
00:52:49.441 --> 00:52:50.440
but before we get off target,

1556
00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:51.870
I mean for the archers out there,

1557
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.280
like where do you stand on this?

1558
00:52:53.281 --> 00:52:55.080
Do you think there's like a comfortable medium,

1559
00:52:55.110 --> 00:53:00.110
like maybe a Tyron Woodley who is a powerful one 70 pounder who's also lightning

1560
00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:02.130
fast.

1561
00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:05.070
<v 7>I think I really want the Conor McGregor where</v>

1562
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.440
<v 5>I was going to say he's,</v>

1563
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:07.850
he's,

1564
00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:08.720
I know that,

1565
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.770
but Tyron Woodley would disagree.

1566
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:14.170
Yeah,

1567
00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:14.591
he is,

1568
00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:15.370
but,

1569
00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:15.821
sorry,

1570
00:53:15.821 --> 00:53:16.080
sorry.

1571
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.400
<v 7>I mean,</v>

1572
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.100
I know,

1573
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:17.460
uh,

1574
00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.030
counting or talks some crap to you,

1575
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:20.420
the last press conference,

1576
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:21.170
but,

1577
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:22.003
um,

1578
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.800
I actually liked that Arrow.

1579
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.010
The animal thinks that he knows what's coming,

1580
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:30.350
but then when it hits him,

1581
00:53:30.351 --> 00:53:32.790
it's like what just happened?

1582
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:33.610
Right.

1583
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.860
Got there too quick,

1584
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:38.160
because I've been at a couple different fights that you've invited me on.

1585
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:38.994
Thank you.

1586
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.640
When Connor hits people,

1587
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:43.530
they think they know what it's going to feel like,

1588
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:48.060
but then when it does look like when that first lefthand hits him,

1589
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.900
their face really change.

1590
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.803
Like,

1591
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.190
I think they expect what it's gonna feel like,

1592
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.870
but when they actually feel it,

1593
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.650
yeah,

1594
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.780
it's a totally different expression.

1595
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:02.160
I mean,

1596
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.530
I've been that way with in competition,

1597
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:05.250
which I've,

1598
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:05.490
you know,

1599
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:09.660
I've shot professionally for a lot of years and then when you meet someone in a

1600
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:14.070
match and then they actually stand next to you and compete with you,

1601
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.030
it's,

1602
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:19.680
you can tell on their face that they're experiencing something different than

1603
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:20.880
they prepare for.

1604
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.020
Right.

1605
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:27.020
I've seen that when Connor hits people and all of a sudden there they just,

1606
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.910
their face changes like,

1607
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.390
oh

1608
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.541
<v 5>right.</v>

1609
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:32.040
I think that's what every competition,

1610
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:32.370
right.

1611
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.780
Is that the same with surfing?

1612
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.150
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1613
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.880
<v 5>Like you're around some people and do you see it underestimating them?</v>

1614
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.410
Well,

1615
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:39.081
not only that,

1616
00:54:39.081 --> 00:54:39.500
but like,

1617
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.790
like maybe when you were coming up,

1618
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:43.340
like you see someone who's on just another level and you go,

1619
00:54:43.341 --> 00:54:43.910
wow,

1620
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.181
okay,

1621
00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:45.140
there's that too.

1622
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.183
When you know what I mean?

1623
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.140
<v 8>Some live where you're like,</v>

1624
00:54:48.141 --> 00:54:48.974
wait a minute.

1625
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.970
And there's a lot of guys who just don't like really,

1626
00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:54.740
I'd like to sort of like the same way you're saying that like it doesn't

1627
00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:57.230
translate like live fights to film,

1628
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:57.930
right?

1629
00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:58.281
It's like,

1630
00:54:58.281 --> 00:54:58.581
Oh yeah,

1631
00:54:58.581 --> 00:54:59.420
that guy is pretty bad ass.

1632
00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:00.201
But in real life,

1633
00:55:00.201 --> 00:55:03.710
like you can't believe how fast and how powerful people are like that.

1634
00:55:03.711 --> 00:55:04.131
With surfing,

1635
00:55:04.131 --> 00:55:05.960
I think it's like that with any sport where it's like,

1636
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:06.441
you know,

1637
00:55:06.441 --> 00:55:09.680
you're expecting to see this guy who you've heard of or read about or watch

1638
00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:12.010
films or something and then you'd see it in real life.

1639
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:12.351
You're like,

1640
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:12.890
what the hell?

1641
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.030
You got to be there live,

1642
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.380
right?

1643
00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:14.820
Yeah.

1644
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.440
Yeah.

1645
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.810
It makes it music comparison to what we're talking about here.

1646
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:18.840
Like maybe like a Dell.

1647
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.030
<v 5>I would go Pavarotti,</v>

1648
00:55:23.031 --> 00:55:24.410
but look it up.

1649
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.150
He's going to Google.

1650
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.860
This is God,

1651
00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.960
this heavyweight named Francis and Dano.

1652
00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:30.591
Who's this?

1653
00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:33.020
A African heavyweight who's a in the UFC.

1654
00:55:33.021 --> 00:55:33.381
He was like,

1655
00:55:33.381 --> 00:55:35.480
what are the best fighters in the heavyweight division right now?

1656
00:55:35.481 --> 00:55:36.740
It's fucking terrifying.

1657
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.000
And Frances in Ghana,

1658
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.470
but this guy a in Ghana,

1659
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.800
there's something crate.

1660
00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:46.640
He's just,

1661
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.091
first of all,

1662
00:55:47.091 --> 00:55:47.781
he's enormous.

1663
00:55:47.781 --> 00:55:50.150
He's like 260 pounds weight.

1664
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.370
I've seen him stacked bill,

1665
00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:55.570
like he's just built like a brick shithouse.

1666
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:56.483
Yeah,

1667
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.291
knocked down.

1668
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:57.671
Andrea,

1669
00:55:57.671 --> 00:55:58.670
I'll ask you one punch,

1670
00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:00.020
but there's something about him,

1671
00:56:00.021 --> 00:56:03.200
like literally when he's walking into the cage,

1672
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:04.310
he's his like

1673
00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.970
his daughters different,

1674
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:13.150
I guess his body is like dance monitor at the desk is shaped clips people and

1675
00:56:13.551 --> 00:56:14.061
they just go,

1676
00:56:14.061 --> 00:56:15.440
what in the fuck.

1677
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:16.680
But it's,

1678
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.980
it's not like foremens like you've got to be there.

1679
00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:20.110
If you see him hit people,

1680
00:56:20.111 --> 00:56:20.751
you go there.

1681
00:56:20.751 --> 00:56:21.670
God can't take a punch.

1682
00:56:21.671 --> 00:56:22.260
I don't know.

1683
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.500
You've got to be there man.

1684
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.160
You got to be

1685
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.461
<v 3>there.</v>

1686
00:56:24.461 --> 00:56:26.410
And did the impact.

1687
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.280
Like when in 19,

1688
00:56:29.281 --> 00:56:31.270
like 96,

1689
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.111
97,

1690
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:32.740
I watched,

1691
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:36.580
there's a guy that is one of those underrated heavyweights of all time.

1692
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:37.271
[inaudible] name is Pedro,

1693
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:38.560
his own and Pedro,

1694
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.240
his AU was a like a real pioneer in,

1695
00:56:41.241 --> 00:56:43.360
in MMA and then more Thai.

1696
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.680
And he uh,

1697
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.950
he was training one time at this place called Beverly Hills Jujitsu and he was

1698
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:51.190
kicking this heavy bag and he was a lump.

1699
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.600
He was kicking this bag.

1700
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:54.820
And I guess if you saw a video,

1701
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:55.990
it'd be kind of impressive.

1702
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.330
But when I was there live,

1703
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.871
I was like,

1704
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:00.850
Jesus fucking Christ.

1705
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:06.390
It was just like three or four levels past anybody I've ever seen in terms of

1706
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:09.640
like the amount of power that could generate with a kick.

1707
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.570
And that's like the same thing within Ghana.

1708
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.331
That's the same thing.

1709
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.830
But a lot of people,

1710
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:15.664
it's like there's,

1711
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:20.440
there's something about seeing something live because you can sort of like get

1712
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:21.310
an idea.

1713
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:21.581
Like,

1714
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:22.600
I'm sure you,

1715
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.450
if you saw a guy surf in a video,

1716
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:26.050
you be like,

1717
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:26.920
oh that guy,

1718
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:28.300
that's a bad motherfucker.

1719
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:28.930
Right.

1720
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.940
But like for the average person,

1721
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.010
you kind of got to see something like

1722
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:33.893
<v 8>live.</v>

1723
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.140
Yeah.

1724
00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.970
There's the little details that you can,

1725
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.023
you know,

1726
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:37.810
you know,

1727
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:38.910
sort of really recognize it,

1728
00:57:38.911 --> 00:57:39.301
you know,

1729
00:57:39.301 --> 00:57:40.260
it really,

1730
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:40.681
really well.

1731
00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:42.770
Whether it's fighting or surfing or whatever.

1732
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.131
Anything.

1733
00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:44.964
Even hunting,

1734
00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:46.523
like,

1735
00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.190
you know,

1736
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.421
Ram,

1737
00:57:47.421 --> 00:57:48.360
he's not here with us now,

1738
00:57:48.361 --> 00:57:49.830
but he was here always hunting with us.

1739
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.830
Perfect example every morning or at green tree too,

1740
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.221
too.

1741
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:54.054
Perfect.

1742
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.410
Cut from the same cloth or campaign.

1743
00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:58.640
Remy made a shot on the move.

1744
00:57:58.641 --> 00:57:59.800
Flon uh,

1745
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:01.670
your ear muffs,

1746
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:02.773
ear muffs.

1747
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:06.390
W when he made a shot on this Moofawn 57 yards,

1748
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.650
it seemed to me like his air,

1749
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.460
I mean an s pattern to the like to what essentially was a cantaloupe size was it

1750
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:16.710
can't live size target that he's shooting at a 57 yards and he shot through like

1751
00:58:16.711 --> 00:58:21.711
six trees from a knee within like a added like a 45 degree angle with his book.

1752
00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:27.050
<v 3>I would like to tell you about a shot that I shot John Dudley shoot a couple of</v>

1753
00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:27.051
days ago,

1754
00:58:27.051 --> 00:58:28.190
but I need permission.

1755
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.830
<v 1>Let me just say,</v>

1756
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.550
tell the 1 billion people.

1757
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:40.710
Let me just say I saw some shit.

1758
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:43.260
Let's just move on.

1759
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.680
I saw some shit.

1760
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:48.840
I saw some shit that I would never attempt,

1761
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.430
but it ended with a perfect heart shop and ethical kill an animal that died in

1762
00:58:53.431 --> 00:58:54.030
seconds.

1763
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:54.900
That's what you're talking about,

1764
00:58:54.901 --> 00:58:55.081
right,

1765
00:58:55.081 --> 00:58:58.530
but we'll see us something live like you can get an idea of how hard something

1766
00:58:58.531 --> 00:58:59.760
is until you see it live.

1767
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.600
Exactly what the expectation of what.

1768
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:02.821
Let me tell you something,

1769
00:59:02.821 --> 00:59:03.840
what our guide said,

1770
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.030
we've saw what John Dudley Davey ever seen.

1771
00:59:06.031 --> 00:59:09.420
Will Farrell when he said what just happened,

1772
00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.520
that just happened.

1773
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:13.990
That just happened whenever.

1774
00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.970
That's what Joe Rogan's faith look like when he turned the wrong.

1775
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.310
Well,

1776
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.400
at least I knew what you can do.

1777
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:21.260
The guide,

1778
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.010
like holy

1779
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.843
<v 0>Jesus,</v>

1780
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.951
holy Jesus.

1781
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:25.790
He just shot that.

1782
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:28.530
I told you he was going to kill it.

1783
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.730
He had to be there.

1784
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.700
But it's like there's levels to everything.

1785
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:36.050
There's levels to writing.

1786
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.640
There's levels to singing.

1787
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:39.530
There's levels to poet.

1788
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.521
I don't know.

1789
00:59:40.521 --> 00:59:41.354
I don't believe that.

1790
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.180
But there's levels to surfing for sure.

1791
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:45.830
There's levels to everything.

1792
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.970
Yeah.

1793
00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:48.121
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1794
00:59:48.121 --> 00:59:50.690
That can't lady at the top level role.

1795
00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.593
Yeah.

1796
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.531
Cat Ladies.

1797
00:59:52.531 --> 00:59:52.891
Good.

1798
00:59:52.891 --> 00:59:53.724
Good drink.

1799
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:54.240
I like it.

1800
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.350
I was skeptical at first.

1801
00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.360
<v 0>Skeptical Lady,</v>

1802
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.250
but she can bring her claws out.

1803
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.630
She brings her be listening.

1804
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:08.100
It's a tally vineyards 2013 w for those listening.

1805
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:12.480
It's a fucking no,

1806
01:00:12.481 --> 01:00:15.240
it's a room service bar.

1807
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:17.880
It's a red line.

1808
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.420
It's a three part red wine with a one part,

1809
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.050
uh,

1810
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:23.040
Tequila patrol

1811
01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.040
<v 7>and a one and a half part.</v>

1812
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.990
A red bull sugar free,

1813
01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.460
what do they call room service.

1814
01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:31.990
But what do they call the room bars?

1815
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.101
Any bars?

1816
01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:34.420
Rebars rape,

1817
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.553
rape.

1818
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.800
We've got a long way trying to figure out whether her bill Wiki is right or a

1819
01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:44.950
Adam Green trees.

1820
01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:45.750
Right.

1821
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.700
So I'll say just one thing about Arrow weight or sleep.

1822
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.570
So there's at a known distance Arrow weight,

1823
01:00:51.571 --> 01:00:52.404
doesn't matter.

1824
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.540
You know how far you're shooting airway.

1825
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.240
I'm all for shooting the very heavy Arrow cause,

1826
01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:01.240
but at a known distance you can reign something

1827
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.270
and it won't move.

1828
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.230
Well that's obvious.

1829
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:11.010
I'm sure it's great that you to have your hair Baxter Arrow has an advantage is

1830
01:01:11.861 --> 01:01:16.090
when something comes running in and you have to snap shoot at it.

1831
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.380
It's like that's it.

1832
01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:22.060
I think 37 yards and say it's at 30 but if you have a faster Arrow,

1833
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.540
you're only going to miss about,

1834
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.490
you're going to miss by a lot less and it doesn't drop as much.

1835
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.720
Actually this much less Barnes bladder.

1836
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.030
I'm so I think to answer your question,

1837
01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:35.440
I think there is a happy medium.

1838
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:35.981
You know,

1839
01:01:35.981 --> 01:01:39.040
so like for you you're shooting a heavier bow so your Arrow,

1840
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:42.880
like a heavier arrow is going to go faster and people with longer draw length

1841
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.130
there arrows going to go faster and they can shoot a heavier arrow.

1842
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.161
Did I,

1843
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:48.190
wouldn't you agree though that like my knee,

1844
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:53.370
90% of our like our like archery hunters will shoot like a medium yarrow.

1845
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.160
No,

1846
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.060
because of that I,

1847
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.630
there's not that many like cam or Joe's,

1848
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.530
it want like a really heavier with a heavy brought at and there's not that many

1849
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:03.370
people that do that.

1850
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.380
What do you shoot for then?

1851
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:08.920
Like people who like exclusively Yukon elk or explicitly not Moose or Susan.

1852
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.750
We hunted water buffaloes has two different errors in this group.

1853
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.103
What are you shooting?

1854
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.333
I shoot,

1855
01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.710
I shoot elite,

1856
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.620
I forgot what they're called.

1857
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.890
They're a 8.1 grains per inch.

1858
01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:24.030
They are elite.

1859
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.770
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank.

1860
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.681
How many green?

1861
01:02:26.681 --> 01:02:27.870
So you're full.

1862
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:28.733
The victory,

1863
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:31.650
the victory armor piercing?

1864
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:31.860
No,

1865
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.040
no.

1866
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.840
Minor victory elites.

1867
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.030
Gotcha.

1868
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.350
Yeah.

1869
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:36.183
Victory,

1870
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.960
victory archery elites and there w 8.1 grams per branching.

1871
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:40.690
Yeah,

1872
01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:41.980
I'm not exactly sure what that,

1873
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.650
so for people listening like 500 grains is about one hour.

1874
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:47.763
Is that correct?

1875
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.330
John?

1876
01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.163
John,

1877
01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.093
call your mom

1878
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:53.543
texting.

1879
01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.780
Refer back to a,

1880
01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:01.670
a heavy hitter that I didn't know the actual force of and went to the Arnold

1881
01:03:01.671 --> 01:03:03.680
classic to compete in like,

1882
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:08.750
I think it was 2005 [inaudible].

1883
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:14.003
Are you doing,

1884
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.400
I was bowling the Vietnam War [inaudible] back when I was canoeing

1885
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:23.694
competitively.

1886
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.500
Actually one two arm classics thinking

1887
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:28.530
tank.

1888
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:30.930
Abbott was fighting Wesley Walls.

1889
01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.900
Who that's not an answer to the question.

1890
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.070
What's an armful arm?

1891
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.533
John Walls.

1892
01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:40.560
Wesley and Wesley knocked him out with the need of the face.

1893
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:40.900
No,

1894
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.733
in any way.

1895
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:47.670
100% true for what organization?

1896
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.290
It was for the Arnold Classic.

1897
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.300
They had UFC in,

1898
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:51.820
no,

1899
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.653
this Ohio,

1900
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.400
listen to me.

1901
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.090
Tank Abbott was never knocked out by a guy named Wesley walls.

1902
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.260
This is incorrect.

1903
01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.550
What year is this?

1904
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.570
Is it Wisley Sim?

1905
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.770
2005 or 2000 I was there live and cabinet.

1906
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:06.683
Yup.

1907
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.260
We've knocked out with a place in the second round.

1908
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:12.100
Tom Campbell was never knocked out with a new face.

1909
01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:12.590
And the second,

1910
01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:17.590
literally the bell wrong pull up tank Abbott's a Wikipedia page.

1911
01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.050
[inaudible]

1912
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.230
I'm so excited that I know something that Joe does.

1913
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.570
Definitely don't for you.

1914
01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:27.404
Definitely.

1915
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.030
You won't be excited in a few moments.

1916
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.320
The powerful Jamie was here.

1917
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.410
What's that?

1918
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.350
Do you remember the fight that tank Abbott got his knee kicked in?

1919
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.011
Oh yeah.

1920
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:40.700
Maurice Smith out of his leg.

1921
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.350
This is a lie.

1922
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:44.850
This is not cat lady.

1923
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:48.840
So when I went to the Arnold Classic,

1924
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.330
I was invited there by Arnold and Frank Zane.

1925
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.860
I went there.

1926
01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.990
I did win within what?

1927
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.130
What'd you do for archery?

1928
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.560
They had archery are treated to army of class.

1929
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:02.820
And then after the second year I recommended to Arnold.

1930
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.713
Did she get as Wiki?

1931
01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.620
Um,

1932
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.750
I recommended the Arnold that they actually,

1933
01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:08.610
instead of having professional archery,

1934
01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:09.630
they have the nasty,

1935
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.830
okay.

1936
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.830
Ohio state finals there so that they could have the high school Nass program had

1937
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.800
their finals at the Arnold Classic,

1938
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:20.080
which I thought would be better for the sport of archery.

1939
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:21.491
But anyway,

1940
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:22.324
I went,

1941
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.163
um,

1942
01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.010
do the UFC fight.

1943
01:05:25.011 --> 01:05:30.011
It was the first time in Ohio that they had that at the US at the or a UFC style

1944
01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:35.110
MMA fight at the Arnold classic and tank thought Wesley Walls,

1945
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.033
I believe.

1946
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.550
No tablets.

1947
01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:41.211
That's cabbage.

1948
01:05:41.211 --> 01:05:41.930
Korea,

1949
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.190
when he's from Hawaii.

1950
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.513
I'm going to tee,

1951
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.641
this is true.

1952
01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:47.170
I'm not,

1953
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:47.871
you're knocked out.

1954
01:05:47.871 --> 01:05:49.840
Cabbage was a k one one photo when I,

1955
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:51.670
by the way it,

1956
01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:53.140
you know you definitely have to,

1957
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:54.140
I just think you're incorrect.

1958
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:56.540
No hundred percent I saw it.

1959
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.770
So anyway,

1960
01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:02.890
I'm ringside corner so we're the fibers come up the aisle to the,

1961
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:04.370
to the rain.

1962
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:05.690
I'm right at corner.

1963
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.730
What year was this first seat?

1964
01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:11.780
I think it was 2006 maybe it was 2005 I'll have to look at my trophy,

1965
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.030
but that's true.

1966
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.151
But anyway,

1967
01:06:17.151 --> 01:06:20.600
I was sitting there and I was all excited because I was getting to see tank

1968
01:06:20.601 --> 01:06:21.420
Abbott fight

1969
01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.980
<v 5>beat Wesley Cabbage,</v>

1970
01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:23.710
Korea.

1971
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:27.180
He knocked him out with one punch and rumble on the Rock in Hawaii.

1972
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:27.341
No,

1973
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:27.421
no,

1974
01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:27.930
no.

1975
01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:29.070
That's definitely right.

1976
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.630
It sets the Arnold classic.

1977
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.410
Okay,

1978
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:31.740
let me,

1979
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.570
let me,

1980
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:32.940
okay.

1981
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.720
Arnold lost do Arnold classic 2000.

1982
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:38.910
It was a UFC fight.

1983
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:39.780
You right.

1984
01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.613
Is that what you're saying?

1985
01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.483
Here's the problem,

1986
01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:44.910
but it wasn't the Arnold Classic Sweetie.

1987
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.070
But the time,

1988
01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.790
2005 rolled around,

1989
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.220
the tank wasn't in the UFC anymore.

1990
01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:52.440
In 2005,

1991
01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:56.790
he got knocked out in rumble on the rock or he knocked out,

1992
01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:57.480
excuse me,

1993
01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.240
a Wesley Correia who is from Hawaii.

1994
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.610
Cabbage is his,

1995
01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:01.850
uh,

1996
01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:02.380
his name.

1997
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:07.380
He got knocked out in a rumble on the rock in Hawaii and that was a Bj Penn

1998
01:07:08.311 --> 01:07:09.144
promotion.

1999
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:11.350
Bj Penn was a promoter for awhile.

2000
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.270
Uh,

2001
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:13.440
before that,

2002
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.370
his,

2003
01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:18.420
he fought in UFC 45 and he,

2004
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.660
he lost to Wesley Correia.

2005
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:27.020
He got Tko owed and that was in Connecticut.

2006
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:29.640
Um,

2007
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.370
so that's Wesley Korea for that.

2008
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:37.080
He got submitted by chemo before that,

2009
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:42.110
he got submitted by Frank Mir toehold before that he got knocked out by Pedro

2010
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:42.660
Huizar,

2011
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.770
I think that was in Brazil.

2012
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.071
Yes,

2013
01:07:44.071 --> 01:07:44.840
it was.

2014
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.673
Thank you.

2015
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.561
Before that,

2016
01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:48.480
he beat Hugo Duarte,

2017
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.800
which is a very tough guy.

2018
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:51.240
That was 1998.

2019
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.900
<v 7>Timing is all shit.</v>

2020
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.140
No,

2021
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:53.980
let's clear this out.

2022
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:55.120
Get on a little phone.

2023
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.310
Ask Him who one.

2024
01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.430
I asked him what happened.

2025
01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.770
There's certain things that I would refer.

2026
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.420
I would defer to your judgment,

2027
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:04.120
UFC fights or not on that list.

2028
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.790
I'm going to prove you wrong.

2029
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:07.930
Well you definitely not going to,

2030
01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:08.764
but good luck.

2031
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:10.451
Listen,

2032
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:12.610
I've seen every cabbage or every tank,

2033
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:13.600
Abbott fight ever.

2034
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.733
I know who beat him.

2035
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.040
I know who didn't beat him.

2036
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.270
<v 5>You know I was,</v>

2037
01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.090
I've been there for a good percentage of them.

2038
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.590
<v 4>I'm going to say this as a friend,</v>

2039
01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:23.483
as a friend.

2040
01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.040
I watched tank Abbott get knocked down.

2041
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.200
You might have thought it was tank.

2042
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.513
No,

2043
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:30.140
because tank Abbott has it.

2044
01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:31.560
Good to you this long.

2045
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.010
Yeah.

2046
01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:33.120
A lot of other guys do too.

2047
01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:39.710
All I'm saying is tank came out and what I was going to say is lot like Brock or

2048
01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:41.094
whatever.

2049
01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:46.020
I was excited to high five take and I was on the inside corner of where they

2050
01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:46.760
come out.

2051
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.250
Right.

2052
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:51.570
And I like tank came out and he was coming out to his music and he was jacked

2053
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.120
and I was supposed to shoot the next day for the tournament and I put my hand up

2054
01:08:57.121 --> 01:09:01.590
like this for him to high five me as he was coming down and he was so jacked for

2055
01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:02.424
the fight.

2056
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.930
I literally think he possibly ripped my shoulder out of the socket.

2057
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.423
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2058
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:11.831
<v 4>Hard.</v>

2059
01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:15.100
That dude hit my hand and he was like,

2060
01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:16.810
and I was like,

2061
01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.813
Dad,

2062
01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:22.720
<v 5>any freaking hit my hands so hard</v>

2063
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.360
<v 4>that I actually thought like,</v>

2064
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:25.260
where's my labor?

2065
01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.870
Matt Zen up in the third row have that thing

2066
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.830
<v 5>because it got hit.</v>

2067
01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:34.831
So give him the Wikipedia page where I'm working on this cat lady is a

2068
01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:36.003
motherfucker.

2069
01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.510
Oh no kidding.

2070
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:38.500
I know you're not.

2071
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:39.171
<v 9>Oh,</v>

2072
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:42.710
so does it go when you walked back to your hotel here on the night of the four

2073
01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.450
seasons in your face,

2074
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:45.170
paint,

2075
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:49.420
camouflage your bow and arrows and then you just roll it in

2076
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:50.490
<v 5>or seasons and melon juice.</v>

2077
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:50.631
Well,

2078
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:51.260
here's the thing,

2079
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:52.490
they're super friendly.

2080
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.971
They're like,

2081
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:53.804
did you get one?

2082
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.980
The talker,

2083
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.970
that Hawaiian accent.

2084
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.833
How'd you do today?

2085
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:59.280
<v 9>Like think about that if you did that at any other hotel,</v>

2086
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.220
<v 5>were any of the four seasons for sure.</v>

2087
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.500
Yeah.

2088
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.080
Four seasons at Beverly Hills to be like,

2089
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:03.711
what the fuck?

2090
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:04.700
It's a terrorist attack.

2091
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.553
You complete.

2092
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.730
This is become John Dudley.

2093
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:10.160
Trying to research is erroneous.

2094
01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.330
Gavin,

2095
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:12.540
I know you are Swedish.

2096
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.540
It was Wesley Walls.

2097
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.790
I don't know who that is exactly.

2098
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.650
That's why I'm be right.

2099
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.553
No,

2100
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.013
no.

2101
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.943
If anyone,

2102
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.510
well Ben has the fucking Wikipedia.

2103
01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:29.570
There's no Wesley while she about to 2005 right now.

2104
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:30.530
Listen,

2105
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.740
by the time 2005 rolled around tank wasn't,

2106
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.080
I don't believe you was fighting in the UFC.

2107
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:39.350
I believe his last fights in the UFC,

2108
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.440
we're against chemo and frank near,

2109
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.210
I think Frank Mir got him in a toe hold.

2110
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:48.620
I think chemo got him in an arm triangle,

2111
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:50.060
a head and arm choke.

2112
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.810
Um,

2113
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.610
I think that was his last fights in the UFC.

2114
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.890
Shout out to tank Abbott.

2115
01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:57.710
If you listen and don't know disrespect well tank,

2116
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.810
he definitely didn't get k owed by some dude.

2117
01:10:59.811 --> 01:11:00.644
That doesn't exist.

2118
01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.100
Did you get the shit kicked out of his knee on that one?

2119
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.040
That one might I saw.

2120
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:04.490
Yeah,

2121
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:05.270
that was Maurice.

2122
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.103
Maurice Smith.

2123
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.320
Maury Smith was a world champion kickboxer and one of the first guys to how the

2124
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.070
world class kickboxing.

2125
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.070
He

2126
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.830
<v 7>was in white compression shorts.</v>

2127
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.470
He was how many cat ladies?

2128
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.980
How many cat ladies did you have?

2129
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:26.670
And tell me how much payoti was mixed in Russian shores.

2130
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.940
He was struggling to barely stay alive in the first and in this second,

2131
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.160
he literally came off the bell with this huge flying knee and fricking clock

2132
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.360
tank in the eye and he was down to the mat.

2133
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:47.390
And the next day I saw tank and Lou Ferrigno and freaking everybody else at the

2134
01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:49.650
Arnold classic.

2135
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.180
And he had this huge fricking well and he was knocked out and one kick,

2136
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:55.890
one need of the eye.

2137
01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:56.941
Boy,

2138
01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:59.010
I wish this wasn't an a podcast so we can,

2139
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.931
well,

2140
01:11:59.931 --> 01:12:00.960
I always tell you the,

2141
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:03.000
the Arnold classic seems amazing.

2142
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.290
So Saturday,

2143
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.290
Saturday,

2144
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300
Saturday,

2145
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:06.570
I don't,

2146
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:07.350
who knows what it is?

2147
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.771
Saturday,

2148
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:10.680

2155
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.340
9:00 AM or it's still early in the morning.

2156
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:28.890
Go back 12 years ago so I can witness this.

2157
01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:30.150
Slide 9:00 AM

2158
01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:31.190

Strength Training Summit Arnold table tennis challenge.

2161
01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.330
While this was going on,

2162
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.730
Arnold was fucking is made.

2163
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.131
He was,

2164
01:12:40.131 --> 01:12:41.840
he was shooting loads and it was made.

2165
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.780
Now we're at 10:00 AM,

2166
01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:46.100
we've had almost had a full day,

2167
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:50.690
the yoga for sports clinics and then the arm arm wrestling finals.

2168
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.080
Then the VIP photo opportunity with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2169
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.570
Amazing.

2170
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.580
Then he Arnold strongman and then 3:00 PM the world record bench press challenge

2171
01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.740
and at 7:00 PM the end of the day,

2172
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.360
the Arnolds strongman finals.

2173
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:03.560
Where's the archery?

2174
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.930
And there's a VIP buffet that for some reason,

2175
01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:10.730
no VIP LaFace slash dance party that starts at 10:00 PM slash dance parking.

2176
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.240
Go back in time to 2005 the dance party starts at 10 and here's the real

2177
01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:14.721
question.

2178
01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:18.460
Do you dance first and get a good appetite first?

2179
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.641
Some dance,

2180
01:13:19.641 --> 01:13:20.420
sluggish.

2181
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.870
There's no way to like go to the first event that day and play through all day

2182
01:13:23.871 --> 01:13:24.800
without cat ladies.

2183
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:25.743
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:29.910
By the time you get to yoga for sports at 11 eight

2185
01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.400
Oh boy.

2186
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.070
<v 7>Have you found this mysterious person that haunts your dreams?</v>

2187
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:41.150
It's true.

2188
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.140
They're not even real.

2189
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.250
The person's not even real.

2190
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.540
Well,

2191
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.950
the problem is cabbage has way more cabbage then walls.

2192
01:13:48.951 --> 01:13:50.900
Did it mean Wesley Korea?

2193
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.741
Yeah,

2194
01:13:51.741 --> 01:13:52.940
but well,

2195
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:56.960
whoever this Wesley walls guy is just googled up fictitional person.

2196
01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.910
It wasn't Walter the receipt for,

2197
01:13:58.911 --> 01:14:00.230
I believe for Carolina Panthers.

2198
01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:03.500
At some point I heard he was a bass fisherman on the pro tour

2199
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.060
representative of Shimano.

2200
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:14.310
<v 1>No,</v>

2201
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:15.550
it wasn't Lezlie.

2202
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:16.421
Yeah,

2203
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:16.930
you're right.

2204
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:17.560
You're right.

2205
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.130
You're definitely right about that.

2206
01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:20.620
I let you off the hook.

2207
01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:21.550
He's dropping now

2208
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.893
45 minutes.

2209
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:27.910
It's impossible not to.

2210
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.220
<v 5>There's certain shit you just can't.</v>

2211
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.530
You can't question me on admission.

2212
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.450
Mixed martial arts records are on that list.

2213
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.270
Tag anyone out there?

2214
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.841
I know they did.

2215
01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:38.740
Definitely not right.

2216
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:39.221
Listen,

2217
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:40.054
you need,

2218
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.720
I've called more than 1500 fights.

2219
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.670
I've been working for the UFC since 1997 I'm definitely right.

2220
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.653
Yes.

2221
01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:50.220
Yeah,

2222
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:50.440
I,

2223
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:50.740
I,

2224
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.740
I've watched every single one of cabbages and tank Abbott's losses and wins.

2225
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:56.770
Seeing them all.

2226
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.330
I've never seen any cabbage fights.

2227
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:59.160
Cavities is bad.

2228
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.960
Motherfucker had a hell of a chin.

2229
01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:04.600
A Duke could take ridiculous punishment.

2230
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.570
The Andre Arlovski fight was a big proof of that.

2231
01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:09.210
So is it Tim Silvia fight it?

2232
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.330
Take some bombs.

2233
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.213
Tough guy.

2234
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:12.931
Tank Abbott.

2235
01:15:12.931 --> 01:15:14.410
Caled them in Hawaii.

2236
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.000
I know.

2237
01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.580
I can tell you is,

2238
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:18.931
<v 1>oh,</v>

2239
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.690
I could tell you is three cat ladies in

2240
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.763
modern,

2241
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.390
that litter box toxo plasma.

2242
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:32.183
This telling you

2243
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.250
<v 5>Wesley,</v>

2244
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.540
if you're out there wasn't,

2245
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.921
he doesn't,

2246
01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:36.070
he's,

2247
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.690
I'm real.

2248
01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:37.700
You gotta make him,

2249
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:38.810
you're going to make him

2250
01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:43.170
west West Simms.

2251
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.420
The beat Frank Mir.

2252
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.690
That might have been thinking it would be stomped him.

2253
01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.190
Wesley Wall is actually,

2254
01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.830
I don't think West my house and

2255
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:53.420
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

2256
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:54.283
Oh my God,

2257
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.900
we got to cut them off.

2258
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:59.800
<v 5>We haven't got to cut them off.</v>

2259
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:00.634
We've got to cut them off.

2260
01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:05.650
Let's move on to other things that are more important to over this.

2261
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.610
Wesley was guys,

2262
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:08.830
there's going to be a Wesley walls.

2263
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:12.010
It's going to be a new character that starts trolling your instinct.

2264
01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.170
<v 1>It's not a rematch,</v>

2265
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.090
tangy gamut.

2266
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.610
I know a one,

2267
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:18.070
they raised it from the records.

2268
01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:19.060
You Illuminati,

2269
01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.440
flat earth,

2270
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.961
hollow,

2271
01:16:23.961 --> 01:16:24.794
earth,

2272
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.050
Earth sometimes fight avid on the flat earth.

2273
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.910
Nobody land on the fucking move.

2274
01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.110
I'll tell you that right now.

2275
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.380
Sores aren't even real.

2276
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.250
<v 8>Joe And I had an interesting conversation to change the subject earlier today</v>

2277
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.400
discussing like what hunting does to your psyche.

2278
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.300
I feel like that's pretty interesting thing to talk about while we're here in

2279
01:16:47.301 --> 01:16:50.960
the midst of a table full of booze and and the great people that hunt,

2280
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.820
so like talk about what we were.

2281
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.620
<v 5>I think it's the ultimate struggle.</v>

2282
01:16:55.621 --> 01:16:59.430
I think that's why everybody at this table who also does very difficult things

2283
01:16:59.431 --> 01:17:01.710
is attracted to it so much because it's such,

2284
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.590
there's such functionality to it.

2285
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.401
I mean,

2286
01:17:05.401 --> 01:17:09.980
everyone at this table has ended the life of an animal and there's,

2287
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.960
<v 3>and it's a very difficult to do,</v>

2288
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.010
and like we were talking about,

2289
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:16.220
these animals jump in this Trang and these animals like so tuned in to what

2290
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.160
you're doing and your movement and your intentions that there's,

2291
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.900
and accomplishing that struggle in getting through that struggle.

2292
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.943
You know,

2293
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.300
it's very,

2294
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:26.930
it's,

2295
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:28.310
it's very compelling.

2296
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:31.520
And I hate to use the word addictive because it has so many negative

2297
01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:32.930
connotations attached to it,

2298
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.410
but it might be the best word to describe to it because it becomes,

2299
01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:38.050
becomes a part of who you are.

2300
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.020
And I know Shane,

2301
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.270
you got this issue right and we all do,

2302
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.133
right?

2303
01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:43.083
You got a bad,

2304
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.130
but there's,

2305
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:44.963
I can see him.

2306
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.280
He's like,

2307
01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.210
he's like drawing.

2308
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.260
<v 8>I mean,</v>

2309
01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.580
we've been talking a little too long.

2310
01:17:54.581 --> 01:17:57.790
It's like starting to get addictive is not like

2311
01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:58.410
they're,

2312
01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:00.150
the addictive is not the killing part.

2313
01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:01.441
The addiction is,

2314
01:18:01.441 --> 01:18:02.830
is the challenge to yourself,

2315
01:18:02.831 --> 01:18:03.420
man.

2316
01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:03.841
Mentally,

2317
01:18:03.841 --> 01:18:04.590
physically.

2318
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:08.430
Some of the things that you can do to just to come up against that ultimate

2319
01:18:08.431 --> 01:18:09.264
challenge.

2320
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.470
It's a singular event.

2321
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.240
Like I'm go,

2322
01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.420
I see this deer,

2323
01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.800
whatever type of deer it is,

2324
01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:16.410
or I see this animal and I got to go get that thing.

2325
01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.330
Those singular events in your life.

2326
01:18:18.331 --> 01:18:21.480
There's not a whole lot of those things like your daily life is is super

2327
01:18:21.481 --> 01:18:21.931
complex,

2328
01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:22.111
right?

2329
01:18:22.111 --> 01:18:22.290
You're,

2330
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:24.840
you're challenged on a lot of different existential levels.

2331
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.360
This is like all the layers of humanity.

2332
01:18:27.361 --> 01:18:28.380
You Strip those things away

2333
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.250
<v 3>and it's also constantly changing and moving.</v>

2334
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.420
It's not like bowling,

2335
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.920
like you step up to the line,

2336
01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:34.940
the pins are set,

2337
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.990
you roll the ball,

2338
01:18:35.991 --> 01:18:37.400
you hope you knock them down.

2339
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:38.140
You know it's,

2340
01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.950
it's so complex.

2341
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:42.030
There's so many variables here.

2342
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.883
Stalking,

2343
01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.390
did I step on a twig,

2344
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:47.440
snap the deer pops his head up and looks at you.

2345
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.830
I'm blown.

2346
01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:53.040
<v 8>So many ways to blow it so many ways and it's never the same like said like</v>

2347
01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:54.660
bowling or baseball or those things.

2348
01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:56.510
You were trying to literally repeat that.

2349
01:18:56.511 --> 01:18:57.990
The repetitive motion of that there's,

2350
01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:58.620
there's,

2351
01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.560
there is a repetitive motion in the process of drawing your bell and letting an

2352
01:19:01.561 --> 01:19:01.981
arrow fly,

2353
01:19:01.981 --> 01:19:05.010
but there's no repetition and what that situation requires.

2354
01:19:05.011 --> 01:19:08.640
Like whether you have to shoot from a knee or whether you shoot it at an angle

2355
01:19:08.641 --> 01:19:12.180
or whether you have to wait or go quick or off the tree.

2356
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.320
There's no repetition in the actual experience of let narrow flight and deer,

2357
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:16.951
which,

2358
01:19:16.951 --> 01:19:20.750
which is the most challenging thing because there's almost no way to prepare

2359
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.750
<v 3>and then the reward isn't is also like so primal.</v>

2360
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:28.410
You actually consume the animal you're eating it.

2361
01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.350
It's the most hell and here's the crazy thing.

2362
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:32.640
It's not like it's bad for you.

2363
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.860
It's not like you kill a bag of Cheetos,

2364
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.233
right?

2365
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:42.010
Killing and eating the most nutritious animal that you can eat.

2366
01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:42.970
It's,

2367
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:47.970
it's literally double the protein content per ounce than domestic beef.

2368
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:51.710
<v 8>I remember like one time I talked to Andrew Zimmern where an interview like,</v>

2369
01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:54.370
I think that's how we met at this for an article for a patient today.

2370
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:55.910
I was talking to Andrew Zimmern about it,

2371
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.940
which shaft traveler and he was like,

2372
01:19:58.941 --> 01:19:59.360
man,

2373
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.180
I really think of like a killing the deer.

2374
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:04.010
Like plucking it tomato out of the garden.

2375
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.540
It's just the right amount.

2376
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:08.040
Is it just right if plump and red is ready to eat.

2377
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:09.780
Like I think of killing deer,

2378
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:13.770
like I think I'm plugging that tomato and magician that,

2379
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:18.180
that experience of growing that thing and slicing it up and then feeding your

2380
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:22.980
family is similar to going out and killing something and hunting has made me

2381
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:27.180
want to garden that have chickens and do hunting is flip the switch for me to

2382
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:31.320
understand that like the feeling it takes to eat something that you've not only

2383
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:34.740
provided but you've worked for and train for and and mentally suffered for it

2384
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:37.440
some level physically too well and it's like a major,

2385
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:39.720
you just have that real connection to your food,

2386
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:42.210
which you don't have otherwise you just don't like.

2387
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:43.950
It's the same thing whether you're a,

2388
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:44.460
you know,

2389
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.040
growing your own veggies or whatever you're doing in your garden or,

2390
01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.690
or going out and getting your own meat,

2391
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:49.250
you know?

2392
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.460
Yeah.

2393
01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.920
It changes what your food is peeling out of the cellophane like container.

2394
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:54.880
Imagine that.

2395
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.970
Like just imagine the story.

2396
01:20:55.971 --> 01:20:56.400
Okay.

2397
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:56.831
Somebody saying,

2398
01:20:56.831 --> 01:20:57.041
okay,

2399
01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:57.791
you're a Predator here.

2400
01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:58.540
Align.

2401
01:20:58.540 --> 01:20:58.960
Wow.

2402
01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.480
Years down the road you're still a predator.

2403
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:03.430
But somebody else is going to deliver to that,

2404
01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:04.840
that antelope to you.

2405
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:05.940
Well then you're not a predator.

2406
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:06.920
Amit.

2407
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.170
Consuming you're a lion is you'll walk into a whole foods.

2408
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:12.280
I'm just going to be like all the African animals and Sophie,

2409
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.950
why I'm still a predator.

2410
01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:14.784
I'm going to eat this shit.

2411
01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:18.090
I'm still alive,

2412
01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:20.043
but I don't mind.

2413
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:23.400
I've taken off my claws and I'm just going to eat it cause somebody pretty rare

2414
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:23.950
for me.

2415
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:24.910
Not only am I going to eat it,

2416
01:21:24.911 --> 01:21:28.960
it's going to be nice lighting or like a wall where it's presented in such a

2417
01:21:28.961 --> 01:21:29.681
wonderful way.

2418
01:21:29.681 --> 01:21:33.190
There'll be a sticker that tells me what's in it with crushed ice.

2419
01:21:33.191 --> 01:21:35.170
This little sticker for telling me what's in this,

2420
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:39.760
you're so wonderful like you imagine how ridiculous that would sound to somebody

2421
01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:43.540
if you presented like are predatory history as a human,

2422
01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.460
like the present that we evolved from caveman men throwing spears at things or

2423
01:21:48.461 --> 01:21:52.930
cavemen going and eating the leftovers or whatever lions killed and 2 million

2424
01:21:52.931 --> 01:21:56.650
years ago to two the same cave men to men.

2425
01:21:56.651 --> 01:21:58.420
He's later walking around in a whole foods,

2426
01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:03.400
peeling off the stickers of a piece of pork and thinking that's humane and okay.

2427
01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.311
<v 5>And it's also,</v>

2428
01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:08.180
it's kind of a cop out because people hate it when you say you have to

2429
01:22:08.181 --> 01:22:10.430
experience it because until you experience it,

2430
01:22:10.431 --> 01:22:11.930
you really don't know what we're talking about.

2431
01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:16.460
But there is such a radical difference between eating a steak that you buy at a

2432
01:22:16.461 --> 01:22:21.461
store and what that experience is and eating the backstrap have an axis deer

2433
01:22:21.711 --> 01:22:23.120
that you had to sneak up on.

2434
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:25.520
You had to crawl on your hands and knees.

2435
01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.420
He had a wait for this thing to be cresting the ridge for the perfect

2436
01:22:29.421 --> 01:22:33.040
opportunity to pass in front of the Bush where you draw back your hardest

2437
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.860
pounding,

2438
01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.110
you're centering your bubble on your,

2439
01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.280
your your rest,

2440
01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:42.050
your arm on your site and you're just drawing back and you just make sure you

2441
01:22:42.051 --> 01:22:46.850
don't fuck this up and you see that our launch and you see it slamming was rib

2442
01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:47.490
cage.

2443
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:47.900
He like,

2444
01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.651
fuck,

2445
01:22:48.651 --> 01:22:53.651
I got 'em and you see it run and he see it fall over and its legs kick.

2446
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:57.590
And then you cut it up and then you cook it and while you're eating that thing,

2447
01:22:57.830 --> 01:23:00.110
you're thinking about what happened.

2448
01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:02.150
You know how that animal died.

2449
01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:02.990
You were there.

2450
01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:03.680
You know,

2451
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.910
you understand this,

2452
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.591
this,

2453
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:10.060
that you respected in a way that no one ever respects anything that comes in a

2454
01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:13.930
ground beef package wrapped in plastic,

2455
01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:15.490
sitting on Styrofoam,

2456
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.760
laying on crushed ice is not the same.

2457
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.190
It's just not around

2458
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.891
<v 8>table.</v>

2459
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:25.180
All of us are accomplished in their own things that we do and work hard at what

2460
01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:26.020
we do and what we love.

2461
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:27.550
We all have families and we,

2462
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.030
you know,

2463
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:29.110
we all have lives,

2464
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:31.780
but we are all eaten up.

2465
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:32.111
We are.

2466
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:32.711
All of us.

2467
01:23:32.711 --> 01:23:33.580
Think about this.

2468
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:36.040
That moment you described all the time,

2469
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.960
it's all almost all I ever think about it.

2470
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.850
<v 5>It's okay.</v>

2471
01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:40.200
Whenever I'm not doing that.

2472
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:43.430
That's what I'm planning on doing it again.

2473
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:45.220
Shane is like that,

2474
01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:46.070
but maybe worse than that.

2475
01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:46.980
Some people have ever seen

2476
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.210
<v 8>how powerful it is for all these people.</v>

2477
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.470
He's from Hawaii.

2478
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:54.430
I'm from Maryland.

2479
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.170
You're from give it to him.

2480
01:23:56.171 --> 01:23:59.050
Austin grew up in New Jersey Bar for New Jersey,

2481
01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:00.130
grew up in California.

2482
01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:00.610
We got a high,

2483
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:01.441
when we get South Dakota,

2484
01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:04.390
like all these people from diverse backgrounds live in different places.

2485
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.790
Find a connection in that same thing.

2486
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:11.470
Like that experience is so powerful that brings people together from all these

2487
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.304
crazy things.

2488
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.420
And when some people said,

2489
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.140
why do you,

2490
01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:14.470
I'd be like,

2491
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:15.400
that's part of it.

2492
01:24:15.401 --> 01:24:16.630
There's a myriad of reasons,

2493
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.620
but that's one of the things like sitting in a room of people that all think the

2494
01:24:20.621 --> 01:24:22.090
same way about that experience.

2495
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.600
That's crazy

2496
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.170
<v 5>Patho.</v>

2497
01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:27.510
I remember listening to a Jim Shockey commercial with Jim Shock.

2498
01:24:27.511 --> 01:24:29.360
He was talking about hunting and he said,

2499
01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:29.601
one,

2500
01:24:29.601 --> 01:24:30.560
I'm not hunting.

2501
01:24:30.561 --> 01:24:31.730
I'm thinking about hunting.

2502
01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.031
I was like,

2503
01:24:32.031 --> 01:24:33.170
what the fuck is wrong with this?

2504
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:36.320
I had never hunted.

2505
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:37.173
He can't relate.

2506
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.170
I couldn't relate.

2507
01:24:38.171 --> 01:24:38.620
I was like,

2508
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:38.831
wow,

2509
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:42.710
this is because I had watched bunch of hunting television shows,

2510
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:45.290
a bunch of hunting things before I ever got into hunting.

2511
01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.520
And I remember thinking the,

2512
01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.260
what I wanted to do was I wanted,

2513
01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.320
I was so disconnected between meat and the death of an animal.

2514
01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.000
So disconnected.

2515
01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.770
So I was like,

2516
01:24:57.771 --> 01:24:58.000
well,

2517
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.800
I need to see it happen or I need to do it myself.

2518
01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:01.610
Something,

2519
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.510
maybe I need to hunt.

2520
01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.190
So I started watching these hunting shows.

2521
01:25:04.191 --> 01:25:07.430
I would go to Channel Six oh five on fucking direct TV.

2522
01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.950
What are these freaks up to?

2523
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.420
Strange low level,

2524
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:12.970
you know,

2525
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:14.380
area of the dial,

2526
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:15.850
the channels where I never go to.

2527
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.350
And then I started watching Jim Shockey show and then I watched Steve Ronell's

2528
01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:21.670
the wild with him.

2529
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.680
And I watched Ted Nugent,

2530
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:24.700
spirit of the wild.

2531
01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:25.091
And I was like,

2532
01:25:25.091 --> 01:25:26.140
what is going on?

2533
01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:26.590
Like,

2534
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:27.880
what are these people up too,

2535
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.193
you know,

2536
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:33.910
got sort of this like weird desire to try this.

2537
01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:36.850
And it took forever before I actually finally did it.

2538
01:25:36.851 --> 01:25:38.470
And when I finally did it was with Rinella.

2539
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.920
But once I finally did it and I shot a mule deer and then we're eating it by the

2540
01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:42.700
fire and my,

2541
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:42.851
Oh,

2542
01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:43.870
I'm doing this forever.

2543
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:45.540
This is immediate.

2544
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.060
I was like,

2545
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:46.900
I'm doing this forever.

2546
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:46.951
Well,

2547
01:25:46.951 --> 01:25:47.070
we

2548
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:48.750
<v 8>first met me and Sam,</v>

2549
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.460
well we shot a moose and a two couple hours later we were in a tiny little house

2550
01:25:53.461 --> 01:25:54.630
and British Columbia.

2551
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.760
You were cooking the liver and onions of the Moose you just shot and heart slice

2552
01:25:58.761 --> 01:26:00.170
out of the heart of the Moose.

2553
01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:00.601
You just,

2554
01:26:00.601 --> 01:26:01.290
you're hot.

2555
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:01.951
And we were eating it.

2556
01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:02.880
And I just sit down and say,

2557
01:26:02.881 --> 01:26:04.490
well thinking like here's the guy,

2558
01:26:04.491 --> 01:26:07.220
he's been through more than I'll ever go through.

2559
01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:10.190
Here's a guy who's experienced more lights and a lot of folks whose like

2560
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:13.430
discovered this thing and not only discovered it but jumped into the,

2561
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:14.980
into the,

2562
01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.810
into it with both feet and it's eating heart and liver.

2563
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.051
I mean,

2564
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:19.100
I know a lot of hunters that won't,

2565
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:20.390
don't want to experience that,

2566
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:20.600
you know,

2567
01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.290
or don't,

2568
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.060
don't open their minds to experience even organs or,

2569
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.191
or whatever.

2570
01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:25.551
But you,

2571
01:26:25.551 --> 01:26:27.110
you jump into that thing and he said like,

2572
01:26:27.111 --> 01:26:27.944
I want all of it.

2573
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:30.140
I want every piece of the experience and I don't want it.

2574
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.790
I don't want to miss anything.

2575
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:33.350
And then once you start to do that,

2576
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.960
I mean that's three years ago.

2577
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.630
And how,

2578
01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:39.740
how much has your mind changed about hunting in those three years?

2579
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:40.953
<v 3>A lot.</v>

2580
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:46.230
Well in those three years I went from being like almost exclusively rifle in the

2581
01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:47.260
beginning,

2582
01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.760
which is probably good way to get started.

2583
01:26:48.761 --> 01:26:48.880
Yeah.

2584
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.713
Cause he's more,

2585
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:54.280
more reliable to be like being almost exclusively archery.

2586
01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.750
And one of the things that struck me about it is one of the things that strikes,

2587
01:26:58.810 --> 01:27:02.800
strikes me about a lot of things about this crazy life that we live is that I

2588
01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:06.100
don't think most people are seeing everything.

2589
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.610
And I think that we live life with blinders on.

2590
01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:13.540
I think one of the reasons why we do that is because life becomes more and more

2591
01:27:13.541 --> 01:27:14.530
complex.

2592
01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.550
The longer we live,

2593
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:18.640
we have more and more responsibilities.

2594
01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:22.290
We have family and they have more and more responsibilities were involved in all

2595
01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.320
this responsibilities.

2596
01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.560
We accumulate debt and we accumulate all these different tasks that require our

2597
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.244
attention.

2598
01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.130
And those things chew up a lot of your time on this earth.

2599
01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.400
And somewhere along the line he forgot a lot of things.

2600
01:27:36.401 --> 01:27:38.110
You forget that you're an organism.

2601
01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:42.460
You forget that you're an organism that has this unique ability to communicate

2602
01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:44.050
and share ideas.

2603
01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.140
And because of this unique ability to communicate,

2604
01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.780
we have this,

2605
01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:50.500
I mean this is what we're doing right now.

2606
01:27:50.501 --> 01:27:54.670
We're sharing these ideas and these ideas resonate with other people and they

2607
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.700
elevate the way and expand the way other people look at life and their,

2608
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:03.550
their words and their ideas to expand our,

2609
01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:05.680
our concepts of life.

2610
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:10.950
And I think that when you stumble across something as intense as hunting or even

2611
01:28:12.221 --> 01:28:13.054
as an archery,

2612
01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.400
which is maybe even without a hunting,

2613
01:28:15.401 --> 01:28:16.900
I've said time and time again,

2614
01:28:16.901 --> 01:28:17.770
if you're a Vegan,

2615
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.310
you should do archery just the same as for the same reason you should do yoga

2616
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.960
for the same reason you should meditate.

2617
01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:27.700
But I think that when you stumble across something that is a real game changer,

2618
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.010
it's almost like your responsibility.

2619
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:32.170
I feel like in a lot of ways what I'm,

2620
01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:34.090
what I do with my life as I'm,

2621
01:28:34.091 --> 01:28:38.350
I'm like a little bit ahead in terms of like,

2622
01:28:38.351 --> 01:28:41.320
there's like a path and I'm a little maybe ahead of where I should be.

2623
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.420
And I'm like,

2624
01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.650
<v 1>guys not see this.</v>

2625
01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:44.603
Come on,

2626
01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:45.563
it's safe.

2627
01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.021
You know,

2628
01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:46.780
I almost like my,

2629
01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.281
come on,

2630
01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:48.390
come on dude.

2631
01:28:48.391 --> 01:28:49.230
I'm telling you,

2632
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.311
come on over here.

2633
01:28:50.311 --> 01:28:51.144
Look at this.

2634
01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:51.860
And I,

2635
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.070
<v 3>I,</v>

2636
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:56.700
I really feel like that and I feel like we all do that to a certain extent.

2637
01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.280
And I think some people are very,

2638
01:28:59.281 --> 01:28:59.730
uh,

2639
01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:01.980
hesitant to do that because they don't want to

2640
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.900
<v 0>be Brandon fucked us</v>

2641
01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.040
<v 3>brand is our fan.</v>

2642
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.510
But a,

2643
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.780
I fucked us.

2644
01:29:07.781 --> 01:29:11.290
I forgot to put my phone on airplane.

2645
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:16.800
Is that I think that hunting like a lot of things in life is,

2646
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.520
um,

2647
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.830
it's not for everybody and you don't have to do it,

2648
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:25.250
but the experience is so intense that most people who do do it feel required to

2649
01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:30.770
let everyone know if there's something else out there that they're,

2650
01:29:30.771 --> 01:29:31.320
this,

2651
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:31.530
the,

2652
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:36.260
the life that we live inside these barriers and these,

2653
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:36.550
the,

2654
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:41.550
this civilization confinements the walls and the structures of cities and of,

2655
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:44.960
uh,

2656
01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.640
of a language and culture.

2657
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.400
All of those erode.

2658
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:55.610
When you're on a spot in stock in Hawaii and you're sneaking up on some deer

2659
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.110
that just wants to stay alive.

2660
01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:58.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2661
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:59.110
No,

2662
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.990
I mean it's,

2663
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:01.990
it goes back to your role,

2664
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.090
to your role as in humanity,

2665
01:30:04.091 --> 01:30:05.110
but also in society.

2666
01:30:05.111 --> 01:30:10.111
Like I feel more accomplished as a human being because I have the ability to

2667
01:30:10.331 --> 01:30:11.830
shoot an access to with it though.

2668
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.863
It's like I don't,

2669
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.753
I can't,

2670
01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:14.380
I don't,

2671
01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:16.540
I don't think somebody can do that as less accomplished.

2672
01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:16.831
But I,

2673
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:21.831
I feel like as a part of my skillset is a human skill set of my,

2674
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.470
you know,

2675
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:27.220
my evolution has a person that has been a tool for me to use to,

2676
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.690
to have it to gain perspective.

2677
01:30:28.691 --> 01:30:31.160
We were talking about some trips that I've been on,

2678
01:30:31.161 --> 01:30:34.210
like there's no way like yeah,

2679
01:30:34.211 --> 01:30:38.110
maybe there's some photos on social media or some things that to the note my

2680
01:30:38.111 --> 01:30:41.230
accomplishment or like what are killed or what the mountains I climbed or the

2681
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:41.830
things I've done.

2682
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:45.970
But the perspective you gain and you take home with you that you know,

2683
01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:47.400
kind of bleeds out into your,

2684
01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.190
your work life and your social life and all the things your interaction with

2685
01:30:51.191 --> 01:30:52.024
other people,

2686
01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:54.190
like those things can't be measured.

2687
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:57.670
So there's some level of measurement that you just can't get from hunting.

2688
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.490
And when we do stuff like this together as a group,

2689
01:31:00.491 --> 01:31:01.780
like there's just some level of,

2690
01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:05.140
I go to shot show or the biggest hunting trade show where we,

2691
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:09.220
we had that video of us getting drunk and screaming and people's,

2692
01:31:09.221 --> 01:31:11.500
I think sometimes people who've never been to that show,

2693
01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:12.970
they don't realize like they,

2694
01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:16.900
the people that I see there and that that Sam sees there and the Deli's he's

2695
01:31:16.901 --> 01:31:19.360
there and then you see when you come and same for Shane,

2696
01:31:19.361 --> 01:31:22.810
like there's like a certain type of hub Mitchell give that person that you've

2697
01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:23.320
hunted with.

2698
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.730
Like there's a bro Hug that like has more intensity and somebody who you just

2699
01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.573
know,

2700
01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:29.880
you may have had a drink with her,

2701
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:33.000
had dinner with sometimes like when I see somebody I have hunted with like we

2702
01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:33.834
freedom,

2703
01:31:34.190 --> 01:31:34.961
we roll out,

2704
01:31:34.961 --> 01:31:36.550
like we will embrace each other.

2705
01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:38.290
And I think there's like that shared experience.

2706
01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:38.411
Like,

2707
01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:38.651
man,

2708
01:31:38.651 --> 01:31:39.610
I'm finally get to see it.

2709
01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:42.520
There's a little bit of that energy back in the room from that time we would

2710
01:31:42.521 --> 01:31:43.354
access to your hunting.

2711
01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.760
So I would say that's,

2712
01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.820
I would say that's a proof that Huntington next people as much as anything else

2713
01:31:50.831 --> 01:31:51.910
like it connects us as,

2714
01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:52.820
as people.

2715
01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:53.031
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2716
01:31:53.031 --> 01:31:54.800
and there's some people that want it to go away.

2717
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.221
You know,

2718
01:31:55.221 --> 01:31:58.910
there's some people that want meat eating entirely to go away and they don't

2719
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.310
animals

2720
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:01.840
<v 5>to be consumed.</v>

2721
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:06.850
But I feel like where we are right now,

2722
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.571
I mean I,

2723
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:12.571
I understand this longing for some Utopian existence where nothing has to suffer

2724
01:32:14.181 --> 01:32:15.160
and nothing that's a doc,

2725
01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:17.380
but that's not currently available.

2726
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.230
It's not currently available in the wild world.

2727
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:22.540
It's not currently available in the human world.

2728
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:26.770
And I think we as a species should do the best that we can to be nice to each

2729
01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:27.604
other.

2730
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.540
But we should also understand that these animals,

2731
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:32.220
they,

2732
01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.140
they do not have the capacity to understand.

2733
01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:38.050
They do not have the capacity for reason,

2734
01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:39.670
for calculation,

2735
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.750
for a coordination of resources.

2736
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.130
These things don't exist.

2737
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.560
And [inaudible] is one of the best examples of that.

2738
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:49.450
It's infested with deer.

2739
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.960
It's great for someone who wants to come on and hear and be a bow hunter.

2740
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.020
It would be terrible if you are a plant and

2741
01:32:57.110 --> 01:33:02.110
<v 0>or maybe if you plan dairy and you'd be like fuck [inaudible] they had to kill</v>

2742
01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:09.260
off all the goats because they brought so many goats on this island that goats

2743
01:33:09.261 --> 01:33:11.320
ate all the vegetation.

2744
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:13.970
You get a point where there was no more rainfall.

2745
01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.130
Stop and think about that shit.

2746
01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:18.050
They ate everything.

2747
01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.820
It was a fucking desert.

2748
01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.160
They had the people that lived here like,

2749
01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:22.850
hey man,

2750
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:23.601
we got to kill these.

2751
01:33:23.601 --> 01:33:25.220
Goddamn goes to the water,

2752
01:33:25.221 --> 01:33:26.090
comes back,

2753
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.361
you know,

2754
01:33:27.361 --> 01:33:31.610
and you can't just like Kumbaya them and uh hey guys got us.

2755
01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.473
You got to eat.

2756
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:36.080
Your Fair share of let us doesn't really work that well.

2757
01:33:36.081 --> 01:33:36.914
Let's say he said

2758
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.810
<v 8>wildlife management expert but there is like these islands like this,</v>

2759
01:33:40.811 --> 01:33:44.350
he knows that you're coming from New Zealand last month and coming to this

2760
01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:45.490
island of Lanai,

2761
01:33:45.491 --> 01:33:48.370
you just realize what happens in a closed ecosystem.

2762
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:53.170
Like a place where there is no opportunity for things to move on and that there

2763
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:57.520
just is no opportunity for for biodiversity is like one of the most important

2764
01:33:57.521 --> 01:33:59.320
things that you could have here.

2765
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.620
So when you have one or two species dominating the landscape,

2766
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:03.760
that's trouble.

2767
01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.960
And that is trouble.

2768
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:05.681
And so what,

2769
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:06.670
what do you do at that point?

2770
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:07.240
You can't,

2771
01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:07.631
like you said,

2772
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.900
you can't snuggle these deer off this island and kill him.

2773
01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:12.330
You bring a share little arrows.

2774
01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.110
Yeah.

2775
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:14.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2776
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.140
All in a big Ole Yeti Cooler,

2777
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.710
wildlife biologists,

2778
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:21.460
the Department of,

2779
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.030
uh,

2780
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.863
wildlife,

2781
01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:23.110
uh,

2782
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:24.160
in California.

2783
01:34:24.161 --> 01:34:25.480
Is that a very interesting thing?

2784
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:26.740
And it's very controversial,

2785
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:29.800
but what they've done is they've outlawed hunting predators.

2786
01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.510
You can't hunt mountain lions.

2787
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.291
So because of that,

2788
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:33.340
there's very few deer.

2789
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.110
And because of that,

2790
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.940
you really don't have to worry about deer accidents.

2791
01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:37.451
You know,

2792
01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:39.280
deer and car accidents kill,

2793
01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:42.340
I think it's 150 people a year.

2794
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:43.000
And there's,

2795
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I think it's actually 200 people a year and 1.5 million accidents.

2796
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:50.103
I think it's,

2797
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:52.450
I think it's about somewhere around there,

2798
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.291
which is insane.

2799
01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:53.711
And John,

2800
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:54.544
where you live,

2801
01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.191
I mean you,

2802
01:34:55.191 --> 01:34:58.040
you're the perfect person to talk to about when I came to your place,

2803
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.120
dude,

2804
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.500
we were there during the Rut and we saw a deer bouncing in front of the road

2805
01:35:03.501 --> 01:35:04.370
left and right.

2806
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.130
We saw a dead deer on the side of the road left and right.

2807
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.731
I mean,

2808
01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:08.510
there is,

2809
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:10.310
people are constantly smashed into him,

2810
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:10.910
right?

2811
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:11.743
<v 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2812
01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.860
we did that on the podcast with you.

2813
01:35:13.861 --> 01:35:18.861
This is an estimated 1.2 3 million deer vehicle collisions occurred in the u s

2814
01:35:19.741 --> 01:35:24.741
between July one 2011 and June 30th,

2815
01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:30.990
2012 costing more than 4 million and vehicle damage,

2816
01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:31.883
4 billion,

2817
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:35.340
4 billion and vehicle damage

2818
01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.020
<v 0>according to the state farm.</v>

2819
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:37.800
Damn,

2820
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.390
that's cheap accident.

2821
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:41.740
<v 1>1.5 million car accidents.</v>

2822
01:35:41.741 --> 01:35:43.000
So I crossed 4 million.

2823
01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:48.330
It's amazing what kind of cars we make and it's not an age goddamn tanks.

2824
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:55.810
[inaudible] he's faggot deer off the road.

2825
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:58.723
That lady.

2826
01:35:59.100 --> 01:35:59.551
<v 0>Wow,</v>

2827
01:35:59.551 --> 01:36:00.540
that's incredible.

2828
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.610
$4 billion a year.

2829
01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.220
200 deaths and 4 billion a year.

2830
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.360
200 deaths.

2831
01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.280
That is truly incredible.

2832
01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:10.470
But that's an imbalanced ecosystem.

2833
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.730
That's too many deer.

2834
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:12.061
I mean,

2835
01:36:12.061 --> 01:36:13.590
it's great if you want to live in Iowa,

2836
01:36:13.591 --> 01:36:16.680
like John Dudley and whack 'em and stack 'em.

2837
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:17.460
Yeah,

2838
01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.030
for sure.

2839
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.840
But I mean,

2840
01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.530
unless aliens come down and spaceships and started fucking setting up blinds,

2841
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:25.363
<v 1>I would,</v>

2842
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.830
I would not flat earth.

2843
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:32.210
Why would they come to a flight or at the same reason why we come to Lanai so

2844
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:33.380
they can do heads or tails.

2845
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:34.243
Aliens.

2846
01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.690
It's a target rich.

2847
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:39.410
They have nuclear slingshots and they like to take us out from the fucking

2848
01:36:39.411 --> 01:36:40.244
skies.

2849
01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:43.900
Doug hide behind clouds deep.

2850
01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:44.870
Yeah.

2851
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.330
We just got to get really good at like bobbing and weaving and the dudes who

2852
01:36:48.331 --> 01:36:51.260
have good headman would it go live on the street?

2853
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.720
I'll come to the outcome to whatever fear they set up,

2854
01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:54.554
if it's okay,

2855
01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.520
but if it's like an in and out burger feeder,

2856
01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.393
like

2857
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:02.390
all these years,

2858
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:03.590
yeah.

2859
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.420
Killian's made in and out Burger.

2860
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:06.313
Imagine

2861
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.930
<v 0>matches.</v>

2862
01:37:07.930 --> 01:37:09.370
They start looking into in and out burger.

2863
01:37:09.371 --> 01:37:09.641
They're like,

2864
01:37:09.641 --> 01:37:11.770
there's no one who formed this corporation.

2865
01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:12.631
Like we've,

2866
01:37:12.631 --> 01:37:13.011
we've,

2867
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:14.380
we've gone deep into the,

2868
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.840
they're the only person that doesn't have a button.

2869
01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.460
<v 1>So all like Paleo people are going,</v>

2870
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.200
they're in shape.

2871
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:24.690
Actually,

2872
01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:27.690
we physically superior,

2873
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.650
fuller figured out how to attack the rutting elk.

2874
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:31.603
Oh Damn.

2875
01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:33.780
They're running bull elk something.

2876
01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:36.070
Humans aren't this big truck hands by the whole foods

2877
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:39.940
on the light post and Austin.

2878
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.840
No,

2879
01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.950
do your Burger Pussy.

2880
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:46.401
Shit man.

2881
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:48.230
All we all humans do is consumed

2882
01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:49.440
<v 0>and we just wake up in the morning,</v>

2883
01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.270
consume and produce and produce.

2884
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:51.900
I mean,

2885
01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.370
we could look at the negative side all day,

2886
01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:57.270
but we're were the reasons why there's irrigation and cell phones and satellite

2887
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.104
dishes.

2888
01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.810
There's good and bad and that big ass TV,

2889
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:03.180
a big ass TV that wasn't made by squirrels.

2890
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:04.883
That's true.

2891
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.850
I argue with vegans all the time and there's hundreds are trying to do the same

2892
01:38:08.851 --> 01:38:09.510
thing as them.

2893
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:11.250
Like they were trying to control our consumption.

2894
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:12.210
Same as you.

2895
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:15.310
I think vegans mean well I really do.

2896
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.420
I think most of them mean well and I think most of them will look at us the same

2897
01:38:18.421 --> 01:38:18.751
way.

2898
01:38:18.751 --> 01:38:22.230
A lot of people look at a lot of things that they're ignorant to,

2899
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:22.901
you know,

2900
01:38:22.901 --> 01:38:24.900
and they cast the judgments on it.

2901
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.850
And it's not because they're bad people,

2902
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:31.830
it's because they just don't understand the full complexity of all the variables

2903
01:38:31.831 --> 01:38:33.630
that are involved in this equation.

2904
01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:36.570
That is life emotional attachment.

2905
01:38:36.571 --> 01:38:40.890
There were more view like veganism as part of their emotional view of the world.

2906
01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:48.130
Top the many bars that open that beer with a fucking custom knock on knife.

2907
01:38:48.931 --> 01:38:49.764
Ladies and gentlemen,

2908
01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.190
I,

2909
01:38:51.190 --> 01:38:52.890
before I get yelled at by my kids,

2910
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:55.080
I've got to wrap this bitch up.

2911
01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.020
Uh,

2912
01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.210
it's three Oh nine here.

2913
01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:59.053
Perfect timing.

2914
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.840
Our friends are picking us up to go hunting right now.

2915
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:05.810
That's probably why Brandon was calling us at three Oh nine three Oh nine 30

2916
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.570
you're getting picked up.

2917
01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:07.760
So everyone,

2918
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:10.850
hey jammer at the 2005 in class.

2919
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:13.450
<v 1>Ah,</v>

2920
01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.373
come on man.

2921
01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:18.463
<v 0>Must Sims</v>

2922
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.650
to the face and the second round please.

2923
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:23.510
Somehow.

2924
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:24.330
All right,

2925
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:27.300
well I think we realize that that did perfect.

2926
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.250
The perfect Arrow is an Adele song.

2927
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.100
Oh my phone died.

2928
01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:35.983
Put It on a Dell.

2929
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.320
We realize that.

2930
01:39:37.321 --> 01:39:42.240
We realize that as Sam's vision for creating this hunting bus is a beautiful

2931
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:43.074
thing.

2932
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:46.920
Realize that Shane Dorian is addicted to bow hunting.

2933
01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:47.490
We did.

2934
01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:49.140
We realized that Yeti coolers,

2935
01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:51.210
the greatest coolers on the planet earth,

2936
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:55.140
we realize we're coming back every year.

2937
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:56.760
We're not telling you wine though.

2938
01:39:56.761 --> 01:39:58.740
You fucking Weirdos.

2939
01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.633
Don't go stock.

2940
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:01.493
Don't please.

2941
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.480
That's it.

2942
01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.510
<v 3>A live from when I thank you very much for 200.</v>

2943
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:07.540
And Ladies and gentlemen,

2944
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:08.440
uh,

2945
01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.460
please check out.

2946
01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:09.820
Uh,

2947
01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.050
knock on podcasts.

2948
01:40:11.150 --> 01:40:12.070
<v 0>You're into archery.</v>

2949
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.863
Knock on TV,

2950
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:15.390
but knock on podcasts,

2951
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:16.743
podcasts,

2952
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:17.720
damage,

2953
01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:17.990
