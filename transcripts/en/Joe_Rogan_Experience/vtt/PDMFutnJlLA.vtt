00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.610
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.963
<v 1>Trevor,</v>

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.893
welcome buddy.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.310
How's it going man?

5
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:19.940
Good man.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.570
When we were,

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.090
I sometimes when people sit down and you know,

8
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.290
you just start talking and you're like,

9
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:24.531
shit,

10
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:24.771
Shit,

11
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:25.604
stop talking.

12
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.880
We've got to record Trevor's a paleontologist and explained to me the job site

13
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:31.551
thing.

14
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:33.740
Like when someone's digging you have to,

15
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.130
you they need a paleontologist onsite in certain places.

16
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.521
<v 0>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.150
well it all depends on really where you are.

18
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.460
So here in the state of California,

19
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.151
we have a,

20
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:44.984
uh,

21
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.470
uh,

22
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.970
a law called sequel.

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It was started in 1970 and that main dates mandates that any archeological or

24
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:53.750
paleontological stuff.

25
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:55.760
So like dead bodies of,

26
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:56.180
of,

27
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.510
you know,

28
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.740
early Californians are glass where all the way up to a woolly mammoth bones are

29
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:01.560
not willy mammoth,

30
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.120
mammoth bones,

31
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.751
saber tooth cats,

32
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:03.291
stuff like that.

33
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.650
Or even older has to be mitigated.

34
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.850
They have to be protected.

35
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.540
So my job right now,

36
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:15.440
I work work for a company called SWCA environmental consultants.

37
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680
We go out and we make sure that the glassware and the fossils and the bones and

38
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:25.820
all that that get found by 40 ton excavation machines when they're building new

39
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.170
hotels in downtown.

40
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.071
Wow.

41
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.551
So yeah,

42
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:31.250
I'm standing next to things that could very easily kill you.

43
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.630
So when they do that,

44
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:34.370
how do they keep from fucking something up?

45
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:34.770
Like what are,

46
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.601
when they're digging in,

47
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.830
is it just dumb luck that you know,

48
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.070
they,

49
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.410
they,

50
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.390
they fuck stuff up.

51
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.350
That's how we find it.

52
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.300
Cause we don't have x Ray Vision.

53
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.630
I can't like look into the ground and go,

54
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:42.801
hey,

55
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.000
there's a whale there.

56
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.343
Um,

57
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.650
so the bulldozers going by the excavators scooping stuff up and then scrambling

58
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:51.170
to check.

59
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.790
Yeah,

60
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.190
it,

61
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.960
it,

62
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.830
it digs this big hole,

63
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.790
dumps it over.

64
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.790
I'm looking in the hole and I'm looking over at the spoil pile where they're

65
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.030
mounting everything up and trying to hop back and forth.

66
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.360
And all of a sudden you hear this sickening crunch and you're like,

67
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.930
oh,

68
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.170
you wave everybody off and there's like this bone sticking out and you sweep it

69
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:09.410
away.

70
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.681
I'm like,

71
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:10.311
Oh crap.

72
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:11.144
It's a mammoth.

73
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.433
Okay.

74
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.790
And then I shut the shut.

75
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.130
I shut the job site down to they get mad at you?

76
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.940
Oh yes.

77
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.361
Really?

78
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:17.810
Yeah.

79
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.780
What's like the biggest thing you've found and how pissed where they?

80
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.823
Um,

81
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.500
I can't say exactly where,

82
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:26.810
but somewhere here in Los Angeles,

83
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.891
uh,

84
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:29.000
I was part of a team.

85
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.590
So the job site I was working on,

86
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:31.550
they found a whale,

87
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.870
a whale,

88
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.000
a fossil whale of 5 million year old whale.

89
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.500
Whoa.

90
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.150
Where there's no water right now.

91
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.310
Holy Shit.

92
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.600
Think like downtown La Whale.

93
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.673
Wow.

94
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.923
That's why,

95
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.591
how long?

96
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:46.610
5 million years old.

97
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:47.720
About 5 million years old.

98
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.620
Holy Fuck.

99
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.420
We were finding shark's teeth and stuff like that,

100
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:51.170
hanging around.

101
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
Um,

102
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.660
and the,

103
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.640
the owner of the company was a,

104
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:56.001
the,

105
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:57.200
the owner of the,

106
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:57.680
uh,

107
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.650
the uh,

108
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.070
construction company.

109
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.170
The forgot what their name is,

110
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.280
a supervisor.

111
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.020
I'm the general contractor.

112
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.801
Uh,

113
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.161
he's like,

114
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:06.521
Oh,

115
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.390
you're just finding teeth.

116
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.661
I'm like,

117
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:07.960
well,

118
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.850
you know where you find really big shark teeth?

119
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.120
You occasionally find their food and they ate whales and he's like,

120
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.301
Oh,

121
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.630
you won't about three weeks later up.

122
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.990
Yup.

123
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.440
Look,

124
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.310
Wale Rib cage.

125
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.151
Wow.

126
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.210
The whole rib cage.

127
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.890
So how big is that following year old whale?

128
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.791
The jackets?

129
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.050
About three quarters.

130
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.130
The size of this table.

131
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.240
A jacket?

132
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.540
Yeah.

133
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.900
Um,

134
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.290
sorry.

135
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.850
I'm like thrown out terms.

136
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.950
We wrap a fossils in plaster to protect it because we're taking the dirt out

137
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:37.570
with them so we can prep it later.

138
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.440
So I'm going to like take out hammers and chisels and about a month and try and

139
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.110
work all of the bones out of this big block of dirt.

140
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.970
So we wrap plastic around it.

141
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.100
We call it plaster jacket.

142
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.243
Oh.

143
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.750
So we put all that on there.

144
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:50.231
And so yeah,

145
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.150
it's about three quarters the size of this table.

146
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.790
I mean it's like 1920 ribs,

147
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.190
like three or four verts some other random bones.

148
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:02.191
We don't know what it is and what makes like some of it stay in the dirt and the

149
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:04.150
rest of it deteriorate.

150
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:05.830
Like what's the dumb luck?

151
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.723
Just dumb luck.

152
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.900
Absolutely dumb luck.

153
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:08.470
It's a,

154
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.340
we get a lot of,

155
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.174
uh,

156
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.900
you know,

157
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.651
paleontology.

158
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:12.640
It's still a young science.

159
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.750
It started in the 18 hundreds and England pretty much before that.

160
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.091
Yeah.

161
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:17.800
Before that was natural philosophy,

162
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.410
natural philosopher philosophy.

163
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.910
Like how so?

164
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.420
Uh,

165
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.420
like in the 1860s when Darwin released the origin of the species is big book on

166
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.714
evolution.

167
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.591
He was saying,

168
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:29.891
Oh,

169
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:30.430
you know,

170
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.500
we don't have that many things in the fossil record.

171
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.090
Cause Paleontology was still new.

172
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.060
Like three years later they found archaeopteryx that big,

173
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.690
that big lizard bird archaeopteryx early bird.

174
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.180
They found that and then everyone went nuts.

175
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.451
It's like,

176
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:44.141
oh crap,

177
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:44.381
look,

178
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.880
evolution fossils,

179
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.714
this is awesome.

180
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.720
So it was this huge uptick in,

181
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.390
in study and now it's one of the,

182
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.180
I mean Ross on friends was a paleontologist.

183
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.220
How many people do you know,

184
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.310
I saw Jurassic Park or 10,000 BC and all that paleontology we're kind of getting

185
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:03.101
into,

186
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:03.430
uh,

187
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.870
getting into its own swing again.

188
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.010
It's Kinda cool right now.

189
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.210
We're kind of cool right now.

190
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.010
We've got piercings were covered in tattoos were kind of,

191
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.680
we're cool.

192
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.081
Hipster.

193
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:11.420
You could,

194
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.740
you could easily be like a chef somewhere or a comic.

195
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.843
Well I've,

196
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.960
I've seen that.

197
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.390
I have a lot of visible tattoos.

198
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:20.260
I'm wearing jeans today,

199
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:20.711
but I'm like,

200
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:21.940
I've got them all over my legs too.

201
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:23.320
And they're all like science.

202
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.610
Either science or Geeky.

203
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.970
Oh,

204
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.480
cool.

205
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.700
And I've seen chefs with like spatulas carrots and minor,

206
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.800
minor like fossil sharp teeth and saber tooth cats.

207
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.130
Yeah.

208
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.850
What does that if turtle the toe and,

209
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.141
Oh,

210
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:36.160
it's a frog.

211
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.583
It's a horned lizard.

212
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.370
Yeah.

213
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.950
It's uh,

214
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.300
my favorite horn lizard.

215
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:40.670
It's a,

216
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.970
the regal horned lizard from the desert southwest.

217
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.870
I'm a nerd man.

218
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.730
I'm a total,

219
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.380
I'm world needs nerds.

220
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.323
Some important,

221
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.330
I love nerds.

222
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.901
Lego's,

223
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:50.890
transformers,

224
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:51.850
lizards,

225
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.540
you know,

226
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.410
that's where you lost me.

227
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.580
You lost me to transform it.

228
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:54.951
I'm sorry.

229
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:58.830
I've got that fucking goofy ass robots attorney.

230
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.110
The cars fuck off.

231
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.740
So when you find like a giant rib cage of a will,

232
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.450
how do you know when to stop looking?

233
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.081
How do you know?

234
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.060
Like we found like five or six bones.

235
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.691
How do you know?

236
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.770
I think we got it all.

237
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.940
When the bones run out,

238
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.830
we stopped and then we dig underneath.

239
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.150
But sometimes when we dig underneath to like pop what we think is everything out

240
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.170
and we find more and then we have to go down and then one jacket can turn into

241
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:27.890
five.

242
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.720
So do you have time constraints?

243
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.140
Like when you press that red button and shut it down,

244
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.180
you could go on for years.

245
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.391
Yeah.

246
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.081
If it's big enough.

247
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.320
Yeah.

248
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.550
Wow.

249
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.240
Did you ever worry about getting me assassinated?

250
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.680
Like I would think these fucking assholes that build parking lot structures,

251
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.530
you know,

252
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.560
like seriously man,

253
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.550
they can be dicks to,

254
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.200
they pull you in a room with a cigar smoke asshole.

255
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.551
No,

256
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:49.911
they don't.

257
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.290
They,

258
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.570
we,

259
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.560
we closed down the site so they can't even get near us unless we let them.

260
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.830
Why we limited to foot traffic only and we're the first ones in,

261
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.950
in the last ones out during the day because we need to make sure everyone else

262
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:04.784
has gone.

263
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.680
So nothing happens to the cause.

264
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:07.071
We're also,

265
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:11.930
we're safeguarding whatever it is we find the most adamant than anybody's ever

266
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.080
gotten with you about keeping a job site open.

267
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.303
Um,

268
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.260
the other week I was a working in archeological site and a guy yelled at me

269
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:25.580
because I was trying to salvage in 1800 Sears catalog that was buried in sand.

270
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.530
And uh,

271
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.100
yeah,

272
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.510
he was getting kind of savage.

273
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.383
Wifi is,

274
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.080
you're stopping my guys fucking piece of trash.

275
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.430
I'm like,

276
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.151
I'm sorry man.

277
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:40.151
This is a datable catalog that has hand illustrated things in it and it's

278
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.230
necessary from the 18 hundreds yeah.

279
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.471
He couldn't see that.

280
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.220
That's kind of cool.

281
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.970
Nope.

282
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.421
I was getting,

283
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:48.920
I was getting in the way of his excavator.

284
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.191
It's like,

285
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:49.850
wow.

286
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.820
So I closed that part of the site,

287
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.670
five feet of the site for three hours and he gave me a,

288
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.010
you're holding up my guys.

289
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.750
It's trash bre.

290
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.560
Wow,

291
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.890
dude.

292
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.760
Chill man.

293
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.410
Trashed from the 18 hundreds.

294
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.244
It's kind of cool,

295
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.650
isn't it?

296
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.480
It's like bottles and horse shoes and be loud there on agenda.

297
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.310
People have their own agenda.

298
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.630
Everybody has their own agenda.

299
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.480
I've always been fascinated by the idea of a fossil because when,

300
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:19.910
when we started learning in school about the fossil record and started learning

301
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:23.870
about fossils and now you look at something and it's actually not even the bone

302
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.420
anymore.

303
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.540
It's like the minerals have replaced the bone.

304
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.940
Like I had a conversation with a friend of mine once about that.

305
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.170
He had a um,

306
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.110
a megalodon tooth on his desk.

307
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:33.261
Yeah,

308
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:33.981
you've got one right there.

309
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:34.340
Yeah.

310
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.870
I found some in la too.

311
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.741
Oh really?

312
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:37.070
Yeah.

313
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.903
And then La,

314
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.380
the whale side I was talking about,

315
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:41.150
we actually found meg teeth before that.

316
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.740
Well that's what I'm saying is like,

317
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:42.951
yeah,

318
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.780
when you find big sharks like that,

319
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:45.860
you can find their food.

320
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.660
Yeah.

321
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.050
But Gala Don in downtown La isn't McCollough Donna's that I say there is it

322
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.980
Miguel it on Megla.

323
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.270
Don You're in fastest is on a different syllable.

324
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.781
It doesn't,

325
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.290
same thing.

326
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.481
Oh,

327
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:55.314
okay.

328
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.570
It's like nuclear new Cuellar it know that it's new.

329
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.120
Clear.

330
00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.370
It's,

331
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.560
that's spelled new.

332
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.533
Clear.

333
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.320
Um,

334
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.230
did you remember how Bush,

335
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:03.770
he's just saying,

336
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:03.940
oh,

337
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.773
again,

338
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.920
new nuclear wheeler dealer.

339
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.310
Yeah,

340
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.540
nuclear bombs.

341
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.350
It's like,

342
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.630
uh,

343
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.463
was it uh,

344
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.750
Californa when a sports tenure used to say that,

345
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.700
uh,

346
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.510
um,

347
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.321
the scientists,

348
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.010
not a politician.

349
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.843
Huh?

350
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.140
The bones.

351
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.040
The teeth rather when they,

352
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.620
you see them and they're all black.

353
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:26.460
I was trying to tell him,

354
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:26.911
I go,

355
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:28.470
that's not really the tooth.

356
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.071
I go,

357
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.010
that's sort of the minerals have kind of taken over with the tooth was you're

358
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:32.661
absolutely right.

359
00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:33.091
And he was like,

360
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:33.241
no,

361
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:34.074
it's fucking tooth.

362
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.943
I'm like too,

363
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.510
it used to be a tooth,

364
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.740
but that's why it's black.

365
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.970
How many black teeth you have.

366
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:39.181
He's like,

367
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.014
it's just fucking old.

368
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.000
Like I don't think it works like that.

369
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.050
Mineralization.

370
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:43.261
Yeah.

371
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:43.650
It,

372
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.100
so all the calcium gets replaced by heavier minerals in the bone,

373
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.934
the tooth,

374
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.811
all that.

375
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:49.650
That's been a,

376
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.700
it's been replaced.

377
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:51.600
It's been petrified.

378
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.680
Just petrified wood still looks like wood waste,

379
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.470
you know,

380
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.300
instead of weighing two pounds of waste,

381
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:59.820
15 fucking rock.

382
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.750
It's cool looking.

383
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.120
Petrified wood is the weirdest shit ever.

384
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.950
But let me tell you,

385
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:05.784
man,

386
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.090
I used to be that kind of paleontologist and I started working at the tar pits

387
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.850
and then I went to Siberia with these woolly mammoths.

388
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.920
They're not petrified.

389
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.671
Yeah.

390
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.970
This is what they were saying in the press thing I found so incredibly

391
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:18.571
fascinating.

392
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:19.020
Yeah.

393
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.200
You're finding completely flat flash frozen animals.

394
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.531
Yeah.

395
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:27.531
There was skin hair like I played with it's lips had undigested food and it's

396
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.640
real clear when you say played with,

397
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.310
yeah.

398
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.000
Well what are you doing?

399
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.060
Front mouth.

400
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:36.830
Yes.

401
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.170
Yes.

402
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.020
Um,

403
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.001
but it's like,

404
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:39.151
yeah,

405
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:39.531
it had the,

406
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:41.460
the whole mouth structure was still there.

407
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:42.300
The lower lip,

408
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.920
the root of the tongue.

409
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.993
The root.

410
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.271
Yeah.

411
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:45.411
The,

412
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.630
it's like the word connects the base of the tongue where it connects in the back

413
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:49.464
of the throat.

414
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.480
It was like still in this animal.

415
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:52.314
It was an animal.

416
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.340
It wasn't bones.

417
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.211
Yeah,

418
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.770
it was creepy man.

419
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.310
Wow.

420
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.890
I'd never dealt with something like that before.

421
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.753
How did it,

422
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.650
how was it so well preserved at a fall into a glacier or something?

423
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.470
We think the way that it was preserved,

424
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:04.831
I mean you'll,

425
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.551
you'll see,

426
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:05.881
you'll,

427
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:06.900
you'll see in the show,

428
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.610
um,

429
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.750
we only kind of have half of a mammoth because the top half has been exposed to

430
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:13.590
weathering and all that,

431
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:16.260
but the bottom half stayed in frozen mud and permafrost.

432
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.700
So it probably got trapped in either a mud bank,

433
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.623
a pit,

434
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.740
something like that,

435
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.870
and got stuck,

436
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:25.680
died,

437
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.730
got buried in snow.

438
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:27.900
The whole thing froze.

439
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.930
And then maybe the back end of it got eaten away.

440
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.220
It got scavenged.

441
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.390
Dogs came on and when,

442
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:33.541
hey,

443
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:34.650
look free meat,

444
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.030
you know,

445
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.370
that,

446
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:36.870
that kind of,

447
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.261
it's just,

448
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:38.094
it's crazy.

449
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.010
I did a podcast with a guy named Randall Carlson.

450
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.880
Have you ever heard of him?

451
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.970
The name sounds familiar and he's an expert in Astro,

452
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.690
um,

453
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.750
in asteroidal impacts and yeah.

454
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.201
Yeah,

455
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:49.560
he was,

456
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.070
oh.

457
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.903
Um,

458
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.300
he had one example of a wooly mammoth that died almost instantly and he believes

459
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:03.241
that the impact of some sort of a large body like killed this thing and not,

460
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:04.631
not just killed it,

461
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:07.480
but broke it's back like upon impact.

462
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.691
Like,

463
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:10.570
so just some massive impact like,

464
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.200
you know,

465
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.000
x amount thousands of years ago,

466
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.130
they think like 12 plus thousand years ago.

467
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.940
Whoa.

468
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.331
Yeah.

469
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:17.560
And he had,

470
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:17.950
uh,

471
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.330
he had actually had photos of it,

472
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:19.660
right.

473
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.710
He had photos of the,

474
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.820
the woolly mammoth and it's broken position and they had found it very

475
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:25.654
similarly.

476
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.240
It was like very well preserved and,

477
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:28.450
uh,

478
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.220
sort of perma frozen weird,

479
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.121
I would think.

480
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:36.121
Something falling from space and then falling from the sky at terminal velocity,

481
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:38.380
if it's like a big rock more than just break,

482
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:39.160
something's bad.

483
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.550
Well,

484
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.070
it depends on,

485
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.010
I guess how close it is to the impact.

486
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.110
Obviously it just fucking killed everything.

487
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.340
Really close to Oh,

488
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:50.260
like an it impacted nearby and flattened the forest for some reason I'm thinking

489
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:50.441
like,

490
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:50.930
you know,

491
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.950
and meteor comes out of the sky and hits the mammoth.

492
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:54.760
Exactly.

493
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:54.911
Well,

494
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.160
you know that a site in Siberia,

495
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:01.090
the tongue gust school site flattened all the trees and all flattened to

496
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.920
everything for like some insane amount of thousands of acres and that was a

497
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:08.990
meteor impact in the 19 early 19 hundreds,

498
00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:10.230
right in 1908 or something,

499
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:11.064
something along those lines.

500
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.860
Um,

501
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.210
well he believes that,

502
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:13.601
you know,

503
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:18.601
that one big one that we found is like a pittance in comparison to some

504
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.990
something that hit around 12,000 years ago and they think there's pretty

505
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:27.991
significant evidence all over Asia and Europe in the form of a nano nano

506
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:29.950
diamonds nuclear blast.

507
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.270
Now I remember his name.

508
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.163
Yeah.

509
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.213
Um,

510
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.010
there is,

511
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.510
there's,

512
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.170
there's evidence of that.

513
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.040
Um,

514
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.830
he did put forth pretty solid hypothesis,

515
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.850
but we're starting to find out we have a,

516
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.030
everything didn't go extinct right at that moment though.

517
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.451
No,

518
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:54.340
he's saying they were about 60% of all land mammals died off in that era.

519
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.630
That's a large,

520
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.860
that's a huge chunk.

521
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.040
Wooly mammoths kept going for how long?

522
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.371
A?

523
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.740
They were around til about 4,000 years ago.

524
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.540
Whoa.

525
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:03.850
Yeah.

526
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.630
Woolly mammoths were living on Wrangel island in northeastern Siberia when the

527
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:09.190
pyramids were being built in Egypt.

528
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.660
Holy Shit.

529
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.760
And then we had pygmy mammoths on the,

530
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.320
on the channel islands.

531
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.660
You can cruise at channel islands outside of La.

532
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.380
Yeah.

533
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.480
Pygmy mammoths.

534
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.830
If you cruise up to the natural history museum at Santa Barbara.

535
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:21.371
Yeah.

536
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.840
They have pygmy mammoths.

537
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:25.960
They're related to another mammoth species we had in North America called the

538
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:26.800
Columbian mammoth.

539
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.550
Wow.

540
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.120
Yeah.

541
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.440
So when were they there?

542
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.303
How Long Risa?

543
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.120
Um,

544
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.200
I think they went extinct about,

545
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.240
uh,

546
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.133
not for,

547
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:35.981
for some reason,

548
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:37.780
like six to 8,000 years ago.

549
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:39.340
Is this stick in my head?

550
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.091
Yeah.

551
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:40.661
We had,

552
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:41.260
um,

553
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.011
11,000,

554
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:44.950
500 years ago we still had saber tooth cats roaming la.

555
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.033
Yeah.

556
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.143
Yeah.

557
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.540
Easy off man.

558
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.010
Saber tooth cat.

559
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.580
A weird fucking animal.

560
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:54.980
Like what made that animal grow?

561
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.810
These huge fangs like that,

562
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:00.410
that was just in order to sink into the next of its victims.

563
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:00.681
Right.

564
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.650
I mean that was an entirely,

565
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.140
it's for,

566
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.320
yeah.

567
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.530
You're basically knives.

568
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.920
Yeah.

569
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.340
Quick,

570
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.000
quick,

571
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.960
quick and easy death.

572
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.320
And they say that like Saber tooth cats even,

573
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:09.621
you know,

574
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:11.090
big cats are alive today.

575
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.590
There's their teeth can actually sense like where the juggler is,

576
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.550
their teeth can like as they sync it and they can feel heartbeats through their

577
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.350
teeth.

578
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.200
You can too.

579
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.180
You can bite your bite,

580
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:23.730
your risks.

581
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.380
It's not going to do that.

582
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:24.710
I know,

583
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.460
but I'm just saying have somebody bite arrest,

584
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.353
not me.

585
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.253
Um,

586
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.370
and you can actually,

587
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:35.150
you can feel the pulsation cause in your mouth and the sensitivity of your

588
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:35.510
teeth.

589
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.240
Yeah.

590
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.430
I,

591
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.831
and you,

592
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:39.410
you know how your teeth hurt when you're eating something cold or drink

593
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:39.611
something.

594
00:15:39.611 --> 00:15:40.640
You've got nerve endings in it.

595
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:40.911
Right?

596
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:41.121
Right.

597
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.391
Yeah.

598
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.050
It makes it just,

599
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:47.050
there's may have a larger nerve ending that I'm not quite sure on cat a cat two

600
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:47.914
fanatic me,

601
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.740
but they may have just a larger nerve ending that allows them to feel,

602
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.880
uh,

603
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.480
easier.

604
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:53.840
Did.

605
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.760
So did you guys stumble upon and he,

606
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:56.900
Saber tooth cats?

607
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.410
Uh,

608
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.250
not in Siberia.

609
00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.010
No.

610
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.920
And when you were doing like job sites in la?

611
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.100
I used to go down,

612
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.240
used to be the assistant lab supervisor at the,

613
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.540
at the La Brea tar pits.

614
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:07.310
I ran it all cats all the time.

615
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.370
I even dropped a skull of one on the floor accidentally.

616
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.181
Oh No.

617
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.600
When I was cleaning it shattered.

618
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.010
Yeah.

619
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.080
I put it back together kind of with glue.

620
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.910
Yeah.

621
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.990
Just see how long that took.

622
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.433
About six months.

623
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.830
Fuck yeah.

624
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.840
One slips.

625
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.950
Six months of work.

626
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.030
Yeah.

627
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.070
Oh my God.

628
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.350
Ever talked to a paleontologist and they say they've never broken,

629
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:28.610
damaged or otherwise,

630
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:29.960
like impacted a bone.

631
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.040
They're lying.

632
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.260
Those motherfuckers.

633
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:32.750
Yeah,

634
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.830
we've all done it.

635
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.820
It happens.

636
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.451
And it's like,

637
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:36.284
imagine,

638
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.160
you know,

639
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.993
it happens man.

640
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.501
Shit all the time.

641
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:39.801
I mean,

642
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:43.390
I almost fell down an ice cliff in Siberia and uh,

643
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.510
my friend got stuck,

644
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.260
uh,

645
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.540
repelling down one and stuck.

646
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.200
Yeah.

647
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.771
You'll see.

648
00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:49.160
Yeah.

649
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.993
For how long?

650
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.630
Um,

651
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.460
he wasn't stuck that long,

652
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:53.630
probably about 10 minutes.

653
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:53.930
But,

654
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.763
uh,

655
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.730
um,

656
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.800
so in the show you'll see Tim king,

657
00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:59.190
he's a like my cohost,

658
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.440
like code venture or buddy.

659
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.460
Um,

660
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.960
we have to get down this ice cliff and,

661
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.290
and it's a huge ice cliff.

662
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:06.940
It's not like,

663
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.220
you know,

664
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:07.461
oh,

665
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:10.310
we're kind of going down from like the top of,

666
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:10.571
you know,

667
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.430
the top of Pierce college down to the street.

668
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.440
Know this is a mountain of ice that were repelling down to fuck ice cliffs.

669
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.370
That's all I have to say.

670
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.480
And Yeah,

671
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:24.500
the bank started eroding away and his rope jammed and he's dangling there and

672
00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:29.300
freaking out and panicking and I'm like down at the bottom looking up going,

673
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:30.350
why isn't he coming down?

674
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:32.300
I'm trying to get them on radio and no one's,

675
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.901
yeah,

676
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:33.710
he got stuck.

677
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.011
We,

678
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.780
we both went into ice ice caves.

679
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:36.710
He got lost.

680
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.933
Oh No.

681
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.200
Light went out and he's got turned around and these caves were like minus 10

682
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:42.770
degrees.

683
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.060
He doesn't have a backup light.

684
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.953
No.

685
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.100
What kind of Shit is that?

686
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:46.341
I don't,

687
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:47.030
I dunno.

688
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.410
I do not have a backup plan.

689
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:51.000
I figured when you go a nice cave does a few things you want to bring.

690
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.540
One of them was a fucking backup light you think I need.

691
00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.040
We,

692
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.110
we were with a whole film crew,

693
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.460
but for,

694
00:17:59.550 --> 00:17:59.821
you know,

695
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:02.610
for narrative sake we,

696
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:02.851
you know,

697
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:03.181
it was,

698
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.380
it was our expedition.

699
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:09.410
He was getting me into Siberia and I was going to do biopsies and discover

700
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.340
mammoths and things like that.

701
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.850
So like going into an ice cave you think,

702
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.151
oh no,

703
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:16.380
I've got this great flashlight.

704
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:17.640
It's in a zip lock bag.

705
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.380
It's this big bank of LEDs.

706
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.240
I've got a little glow thing.

707
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:23.430
I've got a camera that can see in the dark and,

708
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.190
but no light goes out and you kind of panic a little,

709
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.270
a little.

710
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.690
Yeah.

711
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.523
Yeah.

712
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.390
So you guys are there.

713
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.400
You're uncovering how many of these mammos or uncovering that are in such great

714
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.120
condition?

715
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.331
Well,

716
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:39.000
we only got access to one unfortunately.

717
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:39.900
Um,

718
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.080
but finding a mammoth carcass is actually pretty rare.

719
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.980
You can find like a chunk of a mammoth that may have some hair or tissue,

720
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:49.110
like just falling out of a wall or something like that.

721
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.400
More often than not,

722
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:54.990
you find bones finding an intact or even mostly intact carcass.

723
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:59.190
A whole body is a really rare event and we were lucky enough to just to get

724
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:02.610
access to one of the newest ones because we kept striking out.

725
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:02.971
We're like,

726
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:03.181
oh,

727
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:04.410
we're going to go here and look for one.

728
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:04.651
It's like,

729
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:04.980
nope,

730
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.813
didn't find it.

731
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.320
Oh well there may be another one here.

732
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.310
These tusk hunters,

733
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:13.311
these guys that cut into the mountain justifying wooly mammoth tusks and sell

734
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:17.130
them because elephant ivory is illegal.

735
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.300
Mammoth ivory is not because the animal's already dead.

736
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.321
Uh,

737
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:24.060
I see these guys mammoth.

738
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.290
Ivory is beautiful too.

739
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.200
It's got a weird sort of a tan quality to it.

740
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:28.471
Yeah.

741
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:31.320
Tan kind of like kind of almost chocolaty in some places.

742
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:32.370
It's really pretty.

743
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.630
People use it for things,

744
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:33.811
right?

745
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:34.830
For artwork and stuff.

746
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.280
Yup.

747
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.760
Artwork,

748
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.511
they carve it.

749
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:41.511
So a single tusk say you have a 100 pound tusk that is perfect quality.

750
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:44.010
It's just like they pulled it out of an ice cliff,

751
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.280
that thing uncut will be 40,

752
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:48.660
$50,000.

753
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.770
Whoa.

754
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.400
Yeah.

755
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:50.551
Yeah.

756
00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:54.270
There was an episode on a life below zero where they were looking for mammoth

757
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:54.600
Tusk.

758
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.490
If they were looking for him in the side of a mountain or a hillside in Alaska.

759
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.780
They that common.

760
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.141
Yeah,

761
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.950
they're pretty common enough that there's an actual commodity and an and an

762
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:05.581
entire,

763
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:05.940
uh,

764
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.100
there's an entire economy based on it now.

765
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.630
But if you find the Tusk,

766
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.490
it doesn't necessarily mean you'll find the body,

767
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:13.170
cause a lot of the times the body is rotting away.

768
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.980
Right.

769
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.371
Or,

770
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:15.870
and unfortunately in our case,

771
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:16.830
if they find the Tusk,

772
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:18.030
they don't care about the body.

773
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.290
All they want is the task.

774
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.580
When you think and he being a paleontologist and you think about the fossil

775
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:24.180
record,

776
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.560
how many holes are there in it from animals that just simply did not get

777
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.370
fossilized?

778
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:29.521
Oh,

779
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.870
we've got caps all over it.

780
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.380
But,

781
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.030
um,

782
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.863
like,

783
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.020
like trying,

784
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.630
I mean we've got 300,

785
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:37.141
400,

786
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:41.280
500 million year old like bacterial fossils and then we have stuff that died

787
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:41.791
last week.

788
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.310
I mean we have on a long enough timeline,

789
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:44.971
we have her think,

790
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:46.590
but there are spaces cause nothing,

791
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.550
not everything fossilizes or blade for every discovery like that hobbit man they

792
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:54.730
found and as Lori ansys dance 10 years ago already,

793
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.960
it's so weird.

794
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.300
I was just reading that on Twitter this morning,

795
00:20:58.301 --> 00:20:59.140
like in the car here.

796
00:20:59.141 --> 00:20:59.410
I'm like,

797
00:20:59.410 --> 00:20:59.861
that's right.

798
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:02.380
It's been 10 years since the weird hobbit people,

799
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.390
there's still some people that try to dispute that,

800
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:05.890
but apparently they had been discredited.

801
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:06.101
The,

802
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:06.401
that was,

803
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.210
there was a guy who was trying to say that they were actually some form of down

804
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:11.860
syndrome children and that would,

805
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.740
that's what accounted for the deviation.

806
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:15.670
But the,

807
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:17.380
it seems like the consensus is no,

808
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.150
you're dealing with a totally different species.

809
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.350
Yeah.

810
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.750
I'm,

811
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.583
I'm not,

812
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.390
I'm not that up on my,

813
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:22.871
uh,

814
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:24.310
on my Paleo Anthro,

815
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.520
uh,

816
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.380
it's like I'm,

817
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.220
I'm a kind of a hardcore paleontologist.

818
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:27.701
We don't dig.

819
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:29.320
People um,

820
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.050
are kind of like loners and like dead animals more than what it gets.

821
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.030
Found a person.

822
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.740
I would freak out and call my boss.

823
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.120
Oh,

824
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.000
you back up.

825
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.020
Nope.

826
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.670
I don't know if you found like a heavy brow neanderthal looking motherfucker in

827
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:43.020
there,

828
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.600
you know,

829
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.080
that would,

830
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.590
will,

831
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.311
that would rewrite,

832
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:47.710
write history and that would be cool to be part of it.

833
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.740
But I'm actually not legally allowed to cause I'm a paleontologist,

834
00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:53.920
not an archeologist.

835
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.690
If I come across human remains,

836
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000
I stopped the entire project,

837
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.920
I call the coroner and my boss and then like a certified archeologist comes out.

838
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.450
It's very being an archeologist and dealing with people and tribal remains and

839
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.620
all that in California.

840
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:09.281
Very,

841
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:10.240
very specific.

842
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.560
And I know in Mexico City they're constantly like digging for an apartment

843
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:17.800
building or something like that and they find like some huge pyramid structure

844
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:22.000
that's been covered in dirt for thousands of years that nobody knew existed.

845
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.590
My Co host Tim,

846
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:25.630
he's a Mezo American archeologists.

847
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:26.770
That's his deal.

848
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.521
Um,

849
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:28.720
I dunno if he's on that,

850
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.651
on that project.

851
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:32.320
He's a teacher up north in north in nor cal.

852
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.300
But it's,

853
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.661
yeah,

854
00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:35.620
that's his thing.

855
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.371
So yeah,

856
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:38.090
I wish I knew more about the floor.

857
00:22:38.091 --> 00:22:38.780
Ansys,

858
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.100
uh,

859
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.371
think,

860
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.170
because stuff like that's fascinating.

861
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.250
Where did we come from?

862
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.600
And that's another one that was only,

863
00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:45.550
I believe 14,000 years ago.

864
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:46.301
It was alive,

865
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:47.134
right?

866
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.710
The,

867
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.410
the floor answers flurry answers.

868
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:50.860
I,

869
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.041
yeah,

870
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:51.760
I think so.

871
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.150
Yeah.

872
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.010
I think it was somewhere,

873
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.350
it was,

874
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.890
it was recently enough that it was like one of those whoa moments.

875
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:57.101
Like,

876
00:22:57.101 --> 00:22:57.820
Whoa,

877
00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.240
right.

878
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.880
There's a little person run around 14,000 years ago.

879
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:01.080
Right.

880
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.910
Three foot tall humans that were kind of chimp like,

881
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.410
but not really.

882
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.420
And they walked like people did.

883
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:07.900
Right.

884
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.280
That's a mind fuck man.

885
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.330
And then you've got like Australopithecus it's four and a half million years old

886
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:14.210
or pivot gets,

887
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.340
it's like 4.4,

888
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.330
whatever the,

889
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.590
whatever the current thing is.

890
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:18.111
Yeah.

891
00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:18.760
And uh,

892
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.271
but you're right,

893
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:22.480
we do have gaps all over the place and occasionally they fill them and

894
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:23.380
occasionally we fill them.

895
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:24.220
Like there's,

896
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.310
we have a 55 million year old timeline just of horse evolution alone from when

897
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:33.010
they used to be dog sized.

898
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.020
Tiny little like horse,

899
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:37.360
like animals with multiple toes on their,

900
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:37.900
on their,

901
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.800
on their feet,

902
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.440
all the way up to your modern horse.

903
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.353
Uh,

904
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.680
that's like huge single hook.

905
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.440
We have every transitional stage for 55 million years,

906
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.000
including those Budweiser horses.

907
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.943
Yeah.

908
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.430
Including the Clydesdales.

909
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.481
What happened with them?

910
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:54.530
How did they grow here on their feet?

911
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.140
Is that some asshole decided to grow like a poodle?

912
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.500
Yeah,

913
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.610
it's just a,

914
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.990
when you get into things like that,

915
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:00.980
like horse breeds,

916
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:01.820
cap reads,

917
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.230
dog breeds and all that,

918
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.970
that's all human intervention.

919
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.410
That's all artificial selection.

920
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.400
Um,

921
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.761
that's,

922
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:08.420
hey,

923
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.940
I like that horse because it's bigger.

924
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.850
It can carry more and it kind of looks more noble.

925
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.870
So I'm going to breed that with the biggest female I have and then take their

926
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.470
kids and breed them with a second biggest and you just start,

927
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.221
you know,

928
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:27.221
you just start building this genetic pyramid of things that you like and you're,

929
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:32.060
you're naturally selecting the traits you want an artificial or artificially

930
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:34.550
selecting the traits you want and getting rid of the ones you don't.

931
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.080
You don't like that color.

932
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.850
I am only going to breed white horses.

933
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.990
When you first started studying paleontology and you,

934
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.400
you got into this subject,

935
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:48.401
this subject of animals being someone that actually actively changing the way an

936
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:50.420
animal,

937
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.420
that's got to be a very bizarre thing to try to conceptualize that someone took

938
00:24:55.491 --> 00:25:00.200
like say like a wolf and turned it into a Chihuahua like that.

939
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:01.040
That is really the,

940
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.480
that's where they came from.

941
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:02.920
Right?

942
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.320
Yeah.

943
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.420
And this is only recently that discovered,

944
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.790
that's like the last 50,000 years,

945
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.900
God,

946
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.733
yeah,

947
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.590
but it's only been recently proven that they all came from wolves,

948
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:13.030
correct?

949
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.340
Oh yeah.

950
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.070
Genetically,

951
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.370
yeah.

952
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:14.781
Cause you can,

953
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:17.490
you can take a wolf and um,

954
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.610
they're so wolves and dogs,

955
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.690
common ancestor.

956
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.843
Um,

957
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.250
but then woves what more than likely happened was wolves have a,

958
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.630
you had kind of like this,

959
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.350
this protocol wolf.

960
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:31.790
Um,

961
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.140
it was just canus Lupus.

962
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:34.700
It was your normal everyday wolf,

963
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.070
but you have a group of them that we see.

964
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.600
We didn't domesticate wolves,

965
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.010
wolves domesticated us.

966
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.940
They came in closer for fire and for,

967
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.691
for warmth,

968
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:45.524
for food,

969
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:46.790
for protection.

970
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.040
So if you kind of think about it,

971
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.150
we were like giving scraps to these dogs and getting them to come out to come

972
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:53.984
closer.

973
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:54.711
But they're like,

974
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:55.544
hey,

975
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.100
I'm going to hang out with these people because they have a fire,

976
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.490
I have food and I can bark and let them know when things are coming.

977
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.590
So if you think about it,

978
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.030
they actually domesticate it.

979
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:07.610
US was sort of a joint effort.

980
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:08.160
No,

981
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:08.993
maybe.

982
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.080
I occasionally like to knock humans down to come down.

983
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:14.600
And you seem to legs err on the side of the animals.

984
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:15.530
Again,

985
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.363
don't dig people.

986
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.503
Um,

987
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:23.350
so say you have a one like small neighboring city has a big,

988
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.773
a really big,

989
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.350
big bad wolf and you have the second biggest.

990
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.380
So they mate and then the year those puppies are bigger.

991
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:33.710
And then,

992
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.060
oh well we don't want them as furry.

993
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:35.900
So only keep,

994
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.530
uh,

995
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.220
only keep the shorter coat puppies and then breed them.

996
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.300
And then,

997
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.511
yeah.

998
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:42.590
And then all of a sudden you're like,

999
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:42.771
oh,

1000
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:44.340
I need really big dogs.

1001
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:44.611
I don't know.

1002
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:47.370
I want a small dog that I can carry around because it's fashionable.

1003
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.061
Yeah.

1004
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:48.541
It's weird,

1005
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:48.781
man.

1006
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:49.770
Even all our food,

1007
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.020
like do you think a banana,

1008
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:53.280
you know your normal everyday,

1009
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.520
you know cool organic banana that you get that's not,

1010
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.620
that's not a banana of bananas,

1011
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.720
this weird green thing with seeds in it.

1012
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.620
Yeah,

1013
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.453
it's,

1014
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:02.851
yeah.

1015
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:04.380
We've been doing it ever since.

1016
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:09.330
We stopped being nomadic and stop the hunter gatherer lifestyle and started

1017
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:10.140
planting.

1018
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.970
We've been changing our own everything.

1019
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.571
Yeah.

1020
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:17.340
That's why people when they get angry about GMO foods like,

1021
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.880
well,

1022
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.000
every roof need as it is modified.

1023
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.481
Yeah.

1024
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:21.751
I was like,

1025
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:23.370
do you mean lab GMO?

1026
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:24.950
Do you mean like gene spliced?

1027
00:27:24.951 --> 00:27:25.090
Right.

1028
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.420
I mean what I,

1029
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.650
what I call hip generic or hippy engineering,

1030
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:29.700
farming engineering.

1031
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.650
It's like I'm going to make a honey crisp apple by grafting one brand of an

1032
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:35.910
apple or one breed of an apple.

1033
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:37.890
Do another one that's GMO.

1034
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.670
It's like we need to be very brief segue.

1035
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.030
We need to be very clear on our labeling was a grown in a lab.

1036
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:46.740
Does it have fruit fly DNA in it?

1037
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.360
It's like does it glow in the dark?

1038
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:48.811
No.

1039
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:49.260
Okay.

1040
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.280
It's still GMO,

1041
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:52.050
but it's not like some creepy,

1042
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:52.850
you know,

1043
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:53.601
Oh,

1044
00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:54.690
I'm mixing chemicals,

1045
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.441
you know,

1046
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:55.801
God,

1047
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:56.250
Apple.

1048
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.150
Well people just,

1049
00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:59.460
they love to throw that around like organic,

1050
00:27:59.520 --> 00:27:59.881
you know?

1051
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.230
It's like I don't eat organic.

1052
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:01.441
Like,

1053
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:01.710
okay,

1054
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.260
what do you,

1055
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.320
what the fuck are you telling me?

1056
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.081
Define organic.

1057
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:04.210
Yeah.

1058
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.043
What does that mean?

1059
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.910
Do you tell what that means?

1060
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.970
Are you just saying a word that you think makes you look like a better person?

1061
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.540
Right,

1062
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:09.871
right.

1063
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:10.201
It's like,

1064
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:10.530
oh,

1065
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.363
gluten.

1066
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.641
It's like,

1067
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.840
do you know what gluten is?

1068
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.830
It's like,

1069
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.581
do you know,

1070
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:14.941
it's like,

1071
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:17.710
do you really know what free range means or grass,

1072
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.090
fresh grass fed nor hormone,

1073
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.320
a no hormone.

1074
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:22.500
Uh,

1075
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.370
my girlfriend,

1076
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:24.204
she's,

1077
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.080
you know,

1078
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.650
very,

1079
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:25.951
very,

1080
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:26.191
you know,

1081
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:26.761
healthy eating,

1082
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:31.050
very fit and a is getting me on the kick too and like teaches me this stuff like

1083
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:33.720
taught me how to read a label on food and I'm like,

1084
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:33.871
oh,

1085
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:34.440
holy crap.

1086
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.160
Okay,

1087
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.993
that's cool.

1088
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:36.691
Yeah,

1089
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:37.020
it's,

1090
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.741
it's good stuff.

1091
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:38.431
When you actually,

1092
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:42.420
when you take time to do the research things,

1093
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:42.661
you know,

1094
00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:46.220
things just kind of pop out and it's,

1095
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.230
it's kind of Nice that way when you have,

1096
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.600
because we have the internet and all that.

1097
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.620
It's easy.

1098
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.720
It's easy to do research,

1099
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:57.750
but it's also very easy to get thrown a stray with like,

1100
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.260
you know,

1101
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.190
I usually only read things@endinlike.edu.org.

1102
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.270
See I'm the opposite.

1103
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:04.830
I go right to the creationist forum.

1104
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:06.510
I want to know how those motherfuckers is thinking.

1105
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.280
I know how they think.

1106
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:08.910
That's,

1107
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.030
have you seen my Twitter feed that nine times out of 10 all I'm doing is

1108
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:12.630
debating,

1109
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.830
debating evolution with grease.

1110
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:14.221
Really?

1111
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:14.520
Yeah.

1112
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:14.671
Oh,

1113
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:16.020
I think I need to link your Twitter.

1114
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.040
What's your Twitter at?

1115
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:18.210
Tattoos and bones.

1116
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.840
Really?

1117
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.673
Yup.

1118
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.120
Tweeting you like the last two days.

1119
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:21.990
Wow.

1120
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.823
Welcome to the club.

1121
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.663
A lot of fucking people.

1122
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.740
It's a lot of humans.

1123
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.350
Are there stories that twos and bones?

1124
00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:29.184
Yeah.

1125
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1126
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.681
<v 0>A N,</v>

1127
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:31.221
d bones,

1128
00:29:31.221 --> 00:29:31.810
one word d.

1129
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:32.643
Yeah.

1130
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.940
<v 2>All right.</v>

1131
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.981
<v 0>But yeah,</v>

1132
00:29:35.981 --> 00:29:37.210
and like people are,

1133
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.730
I get that a lot because I go to Siberia.

1134
00:29:39.731 --> 00:29:40.090
I,

1135
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.660
I,

1136
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.410
you know,

1137
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.070
with mammoth on

1138
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.070
<v 1>earth and I dig up a woolly mammoth carcass and I'm telling people about it.</v>

1139
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:50.860
And like occasionally I'll throw like a picture up on Twitter cause we filmed it

1140
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:53.740
last year and it's just debuting on Sunday.

1141
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.830
And then people are like,

1142
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.641
oh well look,

1143
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:58.570
you found,

1144
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.130
you found that animal,

1145
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.000
it's frozen.

1146
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.540
It's proof that the world is only 6,000 years old.

1147
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:03.791
I'm like,

1148
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.624
Oh Tony,

1149
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.863
ah,

1150
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:06.950
yeah,

1151
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.720
there's the best.

1152
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.000
Or there's gaps in the fossil record and you know,

1153
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:10.900
things like that.

1154
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.221
And it's just like,

1155
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:13.810
please just do your research.

1156
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.970
Maybe you just need to talk to Kirk Cameron.

1157
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.211
You know,

1158
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.380
you're talking to a lot of shit,

1159
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:20.140
but you don't really know until you sit down with Kirk Cameron.

1160
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.010
Have you ever seen his buddy that shows that banana is proof of evolution?

1161
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.510
That would be ray comfort.

1162
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:25.871
Yes.

1163
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:26.531
This dumb fuck.

1164
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:31.300
Who doesn't even understand that we changed the way bananas look like he calls a

1165
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:32.890
banana and atheist's nightmare.

1166
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.840
If you've seen that video,

1167
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.260
it's beautiful man.

1168
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:35.620
Yeah,

1169
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.071
I'm sorry.

1170
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:41.071
That video is beautiful and him and Duane Gish and the Gish gallop where you're

1171
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:43.240
just like throwing a word salad at somebody.

1172
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:43.571
It's like,

1173
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:43.721
oh,

1174
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:47.410
well evolution isn't true because it's like to shut up.

1175
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.340
They're all just gay.

1176
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.233
That's what it is.

1177
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.090
That's,

1178
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.923
that's fine.

1179
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.070
Bracing.

1180
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.210
Oh,

1181
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:52.810
it's great.

1182
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.800
Nothing wrong with being gay,

1183
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.950
but I really believe that that's what's going on with most of those guys.

1184
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.810
They're the reason why there's so hog.

1185
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:00.010
Wild for Jesus.

1186
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.150
Like Kirk Cameron,

1187
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.260
that's a gay man.

1188
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.940
I'm not a gay man,

1189
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.880
but I'm pretty good spot and some things in this life.

1190
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.110
I know what a gay man it looks like.

1191
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.460
I don't know it all game.

1192
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:10.870
I looked like I'd been fooled before,

1193
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.550
but you know what I'm saying?

1194
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.840
It's like you put a fucking lizard outfit on dog.

1195
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:17.640
I'm going to go,

1196
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:17.890
Ooh,

1197
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.060
something's up with that lizard.

1198
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.020
What does this,

1199
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.920
that's him with the banana.

1200
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.341
Oh yeah,

1201
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:22.121
that's there it is.

1202
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:22.331
Yeah,

1203
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:23.164
peeling it.

1204
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.131
Oh Wow.

1205
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:24.460
Man.

1206
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.293
Goof bag.

1207
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.751
It doesn't he,

1208
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:28.720
but he never even bothered doing the work to understand that.

1209
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.460
We used to have different looking fucking bananas within the,

1210
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.200
within the written human record.

1211
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.460
I got him that long ago.

1212
00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:37.294
Stupid.

1213
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:37.541
Yeah,

1214
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.250
it's,

1215
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:38.780
and,

1216
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.770
and somebody bro,

1217
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.590
I think once somebody brought him an actual,

1218
00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:42.910
a non,

1219
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.860
like an original natural banana and he was like,

1220
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.400
what's that?

1221
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.233
It's a banana.

1222
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:46.750
You dumb.

1223
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.583
Fuck.

1224
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.490
Sorry.

1225
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.110
Cause he's doesn't need that part of his brain.

1226
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.270
His jaw just for fighting off cock,

1227
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.850
fighting off the love of the cock.

1228
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.650
So he puts that just,

1229
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.090
I don't have any room for that.

1230
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.210
I can't do that kind of research,

1231
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:02.140
are busy fighting off the gay.

1232
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.891
So,

1233
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:03.221
uh,

1234
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:06.280
I'll just sit here with this banana and just pontificate.

1235
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.300
I mean,

1236
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.500
he could if that,

1237
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.363
if that,

1238
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.630
if as any way,

1239
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:13.390
shape or form prophecies are true,

1240
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:14.470
it's my thesis.

1241
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.633
Why,

1242
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.530
why you such a phallic symbol?

1243
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.010
Why did he have for all the same reasons,

1244
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.080
he doesn't understand what he's doing.

1245
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.160
It's wrong to,

1246
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.710
it's the transference of,

1247
00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.260
you know,

1248
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:26.510
in,

1249
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.281
into the symbol.

1250
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:27.691
So it's,

1251
00:32:27.691 --> 00:32:28.960
it's actually giving them power.

1252
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:29.830
It makes them feel comfortable,

1253
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.860
but it's such a ridiculous proposition that God made a food that we could hold

1254
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:35.974
perfectly.

1255
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.700
W what?

1256
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.840
Tomatoes are no good.

1257
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.311
Like why?

1258
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:40.230
Why can't you mean a fucking tomatoes

1259
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.750
<v 0>pretty easily held to like,</v>

1260
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.620
that's really stupid.

1261
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:43.330
Why isn't it tomato?

1262
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.163
Banana shaped?

1263
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.380
Which tomato?

1264
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:45.920
That's true,

1265
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.191
right?

1266
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:46.311
Yeah.

1267
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:47.630
You've got cherry tomatoes,

1268
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.950
Sherry's hothouse grape,

1269
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:49.460
you know,

1270
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.630
all these different ones.

1271
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.910
Because we've modified though.

1272
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.591
We modify them.

1273
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:55.610
We got involved.

1274
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.730
That's why I really like my job.

1275
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.250
I go way before all that ride.

1276
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.380
I'm dealing with stuff that I can meet people.

1277
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.240
Yeah.

1278
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.310
At least pre people that had the knowledge to fuck with things.

1279
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.090
Yeah.

1280
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.440
Yeah.

1281
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.780
You know,

1282
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.660
they were still like wandering around going,

1283
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.151
crap,

1284
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:12.920
can we kill that big furry thing?

1285
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.233
We don't know.

1286
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.160
Maybe we'll just wait until one dies and then butcher it and like drive off the

1287
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:20.030
smaller animals.

1288
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.530
But it's stuff like that.

1289
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:22.520
It's watching,

1290
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.930
being able to be in an environment where this animal live.

1291
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:28.040
Like I was in Siberia.

1292
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:28.521
It was,

1293
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:29.271
it was cold.

1294
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.890
It was fucking crazy.

1295
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.920
And I'm in the land of these animals,

1296
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:35.780
looking out over the wastelands,

1297
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.350
like in a train and seeing nothing but reindeer herds.

1298
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.220
And,

1299
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.110
and then then,

1300
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:41.390
uh,

1301
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.650
and then the net people,

1302
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.930
the net people are reindeer herders and they were reindeer leather and they make

1303
00:33:47.931 --> 00:33:52.931
their sleds and they use mammoth ivory for mammoth tusks they find to make the

1304
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:54.710
buckles for their reindeer sleds.

1305
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.683
Wow.

1306
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.660
And these are people that their culture has been doing this for 8,000 years.

1307
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.100
So I'm walking with people who'd just direct relatives may have actually seen

1308
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:04.934
mammoths.

1309
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:06.321
Yeah.

1310
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:06.801
And there's this,

1311
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:10.150
there's this whole sequence in mammoth on earth where I'm hanging out with the

1312
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.430
net people drinking reindeer blood to like,

1313
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.031
you know,

1314
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:16.250
to sacrifice a ranger to the ground.

1315
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:19.730
So I can like find a mammoth cause mammoths to them or bad Juju,

1316
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.380
malice or bad Juju.

1317
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:21.800
Yeah.

1318
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.633
They have this,

1319
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.960
this really,

1320
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:24.681
see,

1321
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:24.971
I'm a,

1322
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:26.690
I'm a scientist and uh,

1323
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:28.100
it's like I'm not a theist.

1324
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.940
I'm not an atheist.

1325
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:30.380
I'm not even agnostic.

1326
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:31.101
I'm just a scientist.

1327
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:31.934
I need data.

1328
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.020
So here I am with these people for a week,

1329
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:36.854
then the net,

1330
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.350
and I don't have my archaeologist,

1331
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.840
anthropology buddy with me because he's,

1332
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.420
he's on a different side of the planet at this point.

1333
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.090
On the other side of Siberia is still trying to find a mammoth.

1334
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.270
I chase a lead going out here and that's the time I really kind of needed him

1335
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:55.040
cause I was completely out of my element.

1336
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.890
I'm with these very naturalistic shamonic,

1337
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.290
animistic people and they're like,

1338
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:00.740
well,

1339
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.010
you know,

1340
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.210
mammoths are bad luck.

1341
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.380
There are a sign of trouble.

1342
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:08.590
And they tell me off camera that they have this three tiered world,

1343
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.700
that they have an upper god,

1344
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:11.511
the middle realm,

1345
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:12.620
and then the lower God,

1346
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.590
the upper God gifted the Nanette people,

1347
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:16.424
the reindeer,

1348
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.790
the lower God is too large and too powerful to use ranger.

1349
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.450
So he uses Mamet's as herd animals and to pull his sled.

1350
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.400
When a mammoth dies,

1351
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.860
the bones fall into the middle world.

1352
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.720
If the net people find them,

1353
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.360
they have to sacrifice one of their reindeer back Wa.

1354
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.370
Yeah.

1355
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.040
So here I am surrounded by all these just very awesome,

1356
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.180
caring,

1357
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.013
Hardy,

1358
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.130
native people.

1359
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.631
And then they're,

1360
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:42.960
well,

1361
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.290
you know,

1362
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.800
we're going to have to sacrifice a reindeer in order for you to find a mammoth

1363
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:48.210
because if you find one,

1364
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.200
pull any bones out,

1365
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:49.780
we have to,

1366
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.550
you know,

1367
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.700
so do you have to compensate them for their Caribou when that happens?

1368
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.630
No,

1369
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.871
no,

1370
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:55.161
they,

1371
00:35:55.161 --> 00:35:55.771
they did it.

1372
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:56.820
They were very welcoming.

1373
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.740
V Like I'm hanging out in their tent.

1374
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.340
But like if you find a mammoth and then they have to sacrifice one of their

1375
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:03.480
reindeer or Caribou.

1376
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.310
Oh they killed,

1377
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.310
they killed the Caribou.

1378
00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.180
Do for that.

1379
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.090
But do you eat it or the they do they have to sacrifice that?

1380
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:10.200
I have to leave it in the ground.

1381
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.450
Like,

1382
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.000
no,

1383
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.341
they ain't.

1384
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:12.174
They ate it,

1385
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.980
but it doesn't go to waste.

1386
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:14.821
It doesn't go to waste.

1387
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:17.580
But then they pass around the cup of blood and they make everybody drink.

1388
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.210
Oh,

1389
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.043
including me.

1390
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.130
What does that taste like?

1391
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.173
Like,

1392
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.220
like he get punched in the mouth and you know,

1393
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:24.330
you're swallowing blood.

1394
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:24.691
It's just,

1395
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:25.524
it's blood.

1396
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:31.110
But the fact that I'm watching the animal get butchered in front of me and it's

1397
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:31.980
not there.

1398
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:36.780
This wouldn't be some like modern weird ritualistic thing with like people

1399
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:39.330
wearing like nitro gloves and it's very clean.

1400
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:40.740
No that it's just like,

1401
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.020
nope.

1402
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.970
Slippy animal open.

1403
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:46.490
Go throw the organs over there and then take this metal Coffee Cup with like

1404
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.030
blue and pink daisy.

1405
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:48.864
Print on it,

1406
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.760
dip it into the chest cavity.

1407
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:51.570
Whoa.

1408
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.470
And pass it around.

1409
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:53.670
Holla.

1410
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.930
It's still steaming.

1411
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.380
I mean the animal had just died 45 seconds ago.

1412
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.010
Did you touch if you've ever touched the inside of one of those animals?

1413
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:02.844
Like right after they die?

1414
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:03.320
Yeah.

1415
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.153
They're so warm.

1416
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:04.890
Yeah.

1417
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.730
The blood was steaming like I'm holding this like Coffee Cup,

1418
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.060
steaming full of blood and I'm just like,

1419
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:13.470
and I had a head cold at the time.

1420
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:13.921
I'm just like,

1421
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:15.480
oh well if will cure the common cold,

1422
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:16.314
why not?

1423
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.490
And I just chug it.

1424
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.830
Do anything to,

1425
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:19.290
uh,

1426
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.741
no.

1427
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:20.460
It kind of,

1428
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.430
it felt like I was sucking on a whole bunch of like copper pennies.

1429
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.800
What if you got a raging hard on?

1430
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.730
Would you,

1431
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.460
would you immediately like call your friends to go listen?

1432
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.000
Um,

1433
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.230
I think I'm onto something.

1434
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.670
Or would you keep it to yourself?

1435
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.290
Hmm.

1436
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.610
I might keep it to myself.

1437
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.150
Really?

1438
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.751
How dare you?

1439
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:37.560
You're a scientist.

1440
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.970
Well you owe the world.

1441
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.631
No,

1442
00:37:39.631 --> 00:37:40.980
I have to test it first.

1443
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.341
Okay.

1444
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:43.110
So you just keep your all,

1445
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.470
all trailers just wandering around Russia with heart arms all the time.

1446
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:48.160
Like what's he doing next?

1447
00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:49.770
Stop St Petersburg.

1448
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.210
Come here.

1449
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.350
I'm not sure.

1450
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.880
Oh Wow.

1451
00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.820
Well not convince.

1452
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:54.654
Give me another cow.

1453
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.350
I was totally doing like the bill Hicks goat boy voice there for a moment.

1454
00:37:58.351 --> 00:37:59.250
It's like very similar.

1455
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.143
Yeah,

1456
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.890
I mammoth boy

1457
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.210
the sound.

1458
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.790
So when you're finding these animals,

1459
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:09.290
uh,

1460
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.520
you,

1461
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.630
you said there were some that were existed,

1462
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.520
existed 4,000 plus years ago.

1463
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:15.600
What,

1464
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.760
how old are the ones that you've find,

1465
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:19.590
like when you found this one that is,

1466
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:24.591
it's essentially like you're finding the actual body of this thing that you feel

1467
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:27.210
the tissue and the hairs on it.

1468
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.133
How old?

1469
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.400
How old was that animal?

1470
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.130
What about 40,000 years old.

1471
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:31.940
Oh yeah.

1472
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:36.940
So before humans had ever stepped foot on [inaudible] North America,

1473
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.863
you know,

1474
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.290
uh,

1475
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.820
10,000 years after native aboriginal people came to a,

1476
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:43.990
came to Australia.

1477
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:44.950
Uh,

1478
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:45.610
like we're,

1479
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.250
it's like that's a stupid long amount of time.

1480
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.640
We can't really get that into our brain,

1481
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.150
can we?

1482
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.480
No,

1483
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:52.811
no.

1484
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:53.171
The,

1485
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:53.621
even,

1486
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:56.320
even as somebody that works in what we call deep time,

1487
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:56.971
like I'm,

1488
00:38:56.971 --> 00:38:59.380
I'm working a site right now that can be,

1489
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.190
you know,

1490
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.581
30,

1491
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:01.810
40,000 years old,

1492
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:04.100
but I just came from a site that was seven,

1493
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:05.200
8 million years old,

1494
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.870
million millions of your continence.

1495
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:08.890
We're in different places.

1496
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.551
Yeah.

1497
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:10.384
That's,

1498
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:15.450
it's like there was a land bridge between Asia and Alaska,

1499
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.840
the Bering Sea Landbridge that these mammoths cruised over 40,000 years ago.

1500
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.320
Ice was different 65 million years ago.

1501
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.940
India wasn't part of Asia.

1502
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.970
It hit it causing a bunch of volcanoes and a comet came in and asteroid and hit

1503
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.960
South American wiped out the dinosaurs.

1504
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.940
Like stuffs in different places,

1505
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:34.430
man.

1506
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.080
Yeah.

1507
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.913
It's like,

1508
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.700
like the rocks you hold depending on where you are.

1509
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:42.430
Some of them are four and 5 billion years old.

1510
00:39:42.431 --> 00:39:44.470
They're as old as the earth itself.

1511
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.010
They reformed when the solar system was forming.

1512
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.530
It's kind of messed up to think about.

1513
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.450
It's almost impossible.

1514
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.020
Yeah.

1515
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.810
As like a point of reference and your little pea brain,

1516
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.070
the monkey brains.

1517
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:57.940
I is like,

1518
00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.540
you think,

1519
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.970
trying to think of what absolute zero is,

1520
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.241
you know,

1521
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:03.130
it's like what true nothingness.

1522
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:03.301
The,

1523
00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:06.400
the concept of zero is very difficult because everyone's like,

1524
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:06.821
oh,

1525
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.061
you know,

1526
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:08.500
I took the coffee Coffee Cup of whey,

1527
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:09.334
I have zero cough,

1528
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.211
but think about that.

1529
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:11.410
Think about zero Coffee Cup.

1530
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.551
There's zero,

1531
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:13.384
there's none.

1532
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.860
It's like trying to remove an entirety of something that is nothingness.

1533
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.090
Then go beyond that.

1534
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.220
Well,

1535
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.220
I was listening to a lecture on the Big Bang where it was explaining the concept

1536
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:27.730
of a pre big man universe,

1537
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:32.350
which apparently they believe only existed for the amount of time that it takes

1538
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:35.080
light to get like across a photon,

1539
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.990
like the or the or across an Adam,

1540
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:38.320
like,

1541
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.320
like literally like in almost a measurably short amount of time where there was

1542
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:44.800
no physics.

1543
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.280
Yeah,

1544
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.671
it was just,

1545
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:46.810
it was a singularity.

1546
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.123
It's just like,

1547
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:48.820
yeah.

1548
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.880
And this one,

1549
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.070
this guy was trying to explain this.

1550
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:54.700
I rewound it and played it back and forth like fucking four times in a row.

1551
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:55.090
And I'm like,

1552
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:55.360
Oh,

1553
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.290
I'm too stupid.

1554
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.371
I'm to sticking with the,

1555
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.180
get that in.

1556
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.480
Like I'm trying to conceptualize the idea of this.

1557
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.141
And then I'm like,

1558
00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:02.381
okay,

1559
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:03.850
well what happened before that?

1560
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.010
No nose?

1561
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:05.350
No,

1562
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.071
no one knows.

1563
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:06.400
I mean,

1564
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.731
even,

1565
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:07.180
even,

1566
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:07.750
uh,

1567
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.470
and that's,

1568
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.670
that's a thing working,

1569
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.860
working in a hard physical science like I do,

1570
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.290
we have radiometric dating,

1571
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.610
we have geology,

1572
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:16.690
we have biology,

1573
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:20.740
we have all this stuff that tells us how old this mammoth is,

1574
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:21.574
what it did,

1575
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:22.630
what it's related to.

1576
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:24.880
We can do gene DNA mapping and all of that.

1577
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:27.640
We can see the evolutionary paths of these animals.

1578
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.320
But then you get into,

1579
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:29.501
well,

1580
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:30.900
how did life on Earth Start Abby?

1581
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:31.600
Genesis,

1582
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:31.871
you know,

1583
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:32.201
it's like,

1584
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:33.034
Whoa,

1585
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:33.800
okay.

1586
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.240
Bacteria and RNA and lightening strikes and where you mean Jesus?

1587
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:39.763
Um,

1588
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.970
do you mean Jesus?

1589
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.290
Jesus came after,

1590
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.473
um,

1591
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.320
it was always here since he's like,

1592
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.660
I'm some plan.

1593
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.540
It's part of the Lord's plan.

1594
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.220
I would have to see empirical data on that.

1595
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.233
Oh Wow.

1596
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.790
So when you're finding these,

1597
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.290
when you're finding these woolly mammoths,

1598
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.060
is this just luck or disseminate,

1599
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.140
alert you to the fact that they found one and then you go,

1600
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.800
we had to use a kind of,

1601
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.330
kind of the scary bit,

1602
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:09.980
which is the Tusk hunters themselves.

1603
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.760
So,

1604
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:10.970
uh,

1605
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.790
so tusk hunting is legal kind of,

1606
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.050
so there's x amount of permits that are released by the Russian government for

1607
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:19.520
people to go and look for tasks.

1608
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.200
One guy that we ran into,

1609
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:23.000
his name's Igor of of course,

1610
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.560
course there were always named Igor.

1611
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.280
Cool.

1612
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.000
Oh Man.

1613
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.833
Right.

1614
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.471
Um,

1615
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:28.221
and he was a cold.

1616
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:28.760
He was cold.

1617
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.050
He was like the river baron.

1618
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:31.250
He had the biggest boat,

1619
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:32.720
the fastest boat,

1620
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.330
and the biggest gun on the entire Yana River.

1621
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:36.650
So the biggest gun?

1622
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.130
Yeah.

1623
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.450
It's like a 50 caliber,

1624
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:39.590
like a Barretts sniper rifle.

1625
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.320
Really?

1626
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:40.730
Yeah.

1627
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.180
Wow.

1628
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.580
Or it's fuck was he shooting Soviet version of it?

1629
00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:44.930
Which I think is the dragon off.

1630
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.033
Um,

1631
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.480
uh,

1632
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.231
but he's like,

1633
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:49.670
he's the boss of that area.

1634
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:51.080
He has a permit,

1635
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:56.420
but there are other people in the area that don't have a tusk permit that try

1636
00:42:56.421 --> 00:43:00.140
and go and poach tusks because they can sell them on the black market.

1637
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:01.850
It's not really more like the gray market.

1638
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.040
You have to have a permit to get a test.

1639
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.610
So if you're a guy and you live in Siberia and you're in your backyard and

1640
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:09.350
you're digging a hole and you find a Tusk,

1641
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.510
you can't just take that Tusk.

1642
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.110
Nope.

1643
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.943
Ha.

1644
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.670
Now there's no such thing as land and mineral rights there.

1645
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.080
Oh look,

1646
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:17.913
10 or anything.

1647
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.520
So what do you do the,

1648
00:43:19.521 --> 00:43:20.870
you have to like pretend,

1649
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:21.201
oh,

1650
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:23.420
just thinking about maybe getting a tuck license,

1651
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:23.751
you know,

1652
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:24.430
whatever.

1653
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.721
You know,

1654
00:43:24.721 --> 00:43:27.320
you pretend you don't have $100,000 worth of Shit,

1655
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:27.810
right?

1656
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.150
Burn.

1657
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:32.150
You find somebody that does have a permit or you sell it on the black market.

1658
00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.890
But these people,

1659
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:35.870
since they go out wit right,

1660
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:37.310
when the snow starts to melt,

1661
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.581
right?

1662
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:40.460
When the permafrost starts to get a start to get weaker,

1663
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:43.250
they go in and they drill in and dig into these cliff sides.

1664
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.850
They know where all of the big fines are first.

1665
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.713
So,

1666
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.260
uh,

1667
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.260
Tim and I had to get in well with this kind of weird gray hat,

1668
00:43:55.490 --> 00:44:00.490
semi mob scene of Tusk hunters and here's like two American dudes walking in,

1669
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:02.211
you know,

1670
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:06.440
one's dressed as Indiana Jones was ones dressed as a biker coming in and going,

1671
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:06.861
hey,

1672
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:08.150
do you know where any mammoths are?

1673
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.800
And they're looking at us like,

1674
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.251
yeah,

1675
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:12.230
you're wealthy American dude.

1676
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.730
Um,

1677
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.460
we don't really want to tell you because you're going to take the tusks away and

1678
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.290
this is our entire commodity.

1679
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:22.280
So we had to really be nice to them and really be very,

1680
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.580
very differing because we heard a few times that some of these tusk bosses,

1681
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:29.060
the big guys,

1682
00:44:29.061 --> 00:44:29.990
kind of like Igor,

1683
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.730
there was a group that went in to poach him.

1684
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:34.290
One got sent home in a box.

1685
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.700
They killed him.

1686
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.390
Yeah,

1687
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.290
because he was poaching.

1688
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:37.950
Yeah.

1689
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.200
Well in likes one dude's area.

1690
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:40.650
So we're,

1691
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.450
we're dealing with serious people.

1692
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.310
Like we're walking through parts of,

1693
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:45.090
you know,

1694
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.080
Nowheresville,

1695
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:47.760
northeastern Siberia past,

1696
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.653
you know,

1697
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.660
cars that like with bullet holes in them.

1698
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:52.620
And this is like,

1699
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.420
it's not the wild west,

1700
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.500
it's the wild east.

1701
00:44:55.530 --> 00:45:00.530
It's laws don't really apply in some of the places we were in Wa so it's just a

1702
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.070
completely different animal.

1703
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.550
Oh yeah.

1704
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.001
It's,

1705
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:04.530
it was something I'd never,

1706
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.560
I was not prepared for.

1707
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.670
So how long does the politics of like getting in with these people,

1708
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:15.320
how long does that take for them to trust you to the point where they're going

1709
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:16.350
to lead you to the style?

1710
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:16.921
Well,

1711
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:17.560
we,

1712
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.540
we would talk,

1713
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.230
uh,

1714
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.411
you know,

1715
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:23.520
we would have people talk on our behalf for a couple days and then we would go

1716
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:23.911
meet them.

1717
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:26.910
We kind of try and butter them up and vodka or some shit.

1718
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.450
Yeah,

1719
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:27.661
no,

1720
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:28.381
no better.

1721
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:29.660
We brought them like Jamison,

1722
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:30.240
uh,

1723
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.970
things like that.

1724
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.190
Don't say better to them.

1725
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:32.610
Uh,

1726
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.060
no,

1727
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.230
but the than vodka,

1728
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.041
no man,

1729
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:38.874
you break out,

1730
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.740
break out a bottle of Jameson private reserve.

1731
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:41.430
They go nuts.

1732
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.731
Really?

1733
00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:42.590
They love Jamison's.

1734
00:45:42.591 --> 00:45:42.900
Yeah.

1735
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.830
What about Jack Daniels?

1736
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:45.720
What about a good goddamn American beverage?

1737
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.070
No,

1738
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.903
we don't.

1739
00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:49.470
No,

1740
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.340
we tried man.

1741
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.423
Makers,

1742
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.740
makers would have been good.

1743
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.310
I didn't have,

1744
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.260
there wasn't any at the duty free shop cause we,

1745
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.940
I flew from La to London to Moscow and that was,

1746
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.620
so I flew from La to London,

1747
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.480
spent 19 hours in London gearing up and hit a duty free shop at Heathrow before

1748
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:07.500
we got to Moscow.

1749
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.330
So then we flew to Moscow,

1750
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:14.331
then we flew something like across I think 10 times zones to this tiny little

1751
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:15.900
town called Yakutsk.

1752
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:17.670
And once you're there,

1753
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.240
all bets are off because yeah,

1754
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:26.241
trying to find anything there that remotely resembles something American is,

1755
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.980
I was not ready for this.

1756
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.730
Wow.

1757
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.181
It was,

1758
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:31.620
it was really weird man.

1759
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:34.480
So do you speak Russian or read Russian?

1760
00:46:34.481 --> 00:46:34.720
No,

1761
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.200
I kind of started a,

1762
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.620
kind of started faking it to the point I was there for six weeks.

1763
00:46:40.621 --> 00:46:41.820
It got to the point where,

1764
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:42.751
you know,

1765
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:43.584
uh,

1766
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.310
uh,

1767
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:44.581
you know,

1768
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:44.940
like,

1769
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.450
like,

1770
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:45.960
uh,

1771
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.410
thank you.

1772
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.160
[inaudible]

1773
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.470
you know,

1774
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.680
stuff like that just kind of started to happen.

1775
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:50.161
I did,

1776
00:46:50.161 --> 00:46:50.581
however,

1777
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:52.740
go on an adventure by myself,

1778
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.340
no production assistants,

1779
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.141
no director,

1780
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:55.860
nothing,

1781
00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.030
trying to track down a pharmacy because I had like an ear infection.

1782
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:00.421
And I'm like,

1783
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:00.781
okay,

1784
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:05.220
so I'm on Google trying to learn the words and then try and it's like uptake

1785
00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.140
ethica and people are like,

1786
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.390
oh Duh,

1787
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.470
Duh Dude,

1788
00:47:10.471 --> 00:47:11.490
I don't understand Russian.

1789
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.040
So I'm like in a weird combination of Google,

1790
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.260
translate maps on,

1791
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:20.580
on my phone and then starting to recognize how the letters work.

1792
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.780
I found a pharmacy,

1793
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.520
I was proud of myself.

1794
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.660
How long did that take?

1795
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.280
About 45 minutes.

1796
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:27.900
And it was right around the corner from the hotel.

1797
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.210
So I went like four different opposite directions.

1798
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:31.660
And then,

1799
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.020
yeah.

1800
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.710
And then you have to find ear infection medication.

1801
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.060
Try asking someone that doesn't speak English for hydrogen peroxide.

1802
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.810
What does it look like in Russian too?

1803
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.880
They have that wacky language yet cyrillic,

1804
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:46.714
it's all like,

1805
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.530
like upside down cues and all week.

1806
00:47:49.531 --> 00:47:50.800
So it,

1807
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.610
it's,

1808
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.210
it was,

1809
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.500
it was an adventure man.

1810
00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:54.940
It was absolutely an adventure.

1811
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:55.361
I in,

1812
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:57.190
some of them I wish were in the show,

1813
00:47:57.191 --> 00:47:57.461
but the,

1814
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:58.840
the stuff that's in the show,

1815
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.610
it's going to blow your mind.

1816
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.600
We're in ice caves were,

1817
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.370
were climbing down.

1818
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.230
Cliffs were touching,

1819
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.320
physically touching the skin of a wooly mammoth that that's like 40,000 years

1820
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:11.771
old.

1821
00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:12.101
I'm like,

1822
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:14.860
I'm showing the trunk the task,

1823
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:19.450
I'm doing a full biological study on this thing with tissue and blood and the

1824
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:21.400
environment that you're doing this in a,

1825
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.480
how is it outside,

1826
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.340
outside of permafrost cave.

1827
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.233
In a truck.

1828
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:26.230
Yeah.

1829
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.930
And so do you cover this thing when you find it,

1830
00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:30.490
do you like how do you try it?

1831
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.450
You attempt to mitigate the damage that the son and the one woman,

1832
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:40.530
the one we finally got our hands on was discovered a few months before and it

1833
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:43.090
was secret hid away in this weird,

1834
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:44.230
uh,

1835
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.270
it was like a permafrost fish locker.

1836
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.910
It's this natural cave that they store their food in.

1837
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.180
So were we were the first Westerners to see this thing cause it like,

1838
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.090
it kind of made a news,

1839
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.541
uh,

1840
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:56.220
news,

1841
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:56.620
uh,

1842
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.161
splash.

1843
00:48:57.161 --> 00:49:00.250
It was like the bleeding mammoth and everyone's like,

1844
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:01.270
oh cool.

1845
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:01.481
You know,

1846
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:02.171
there's a woolly mammoth,

1847
00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:03.040
it's leaking blood.

1848
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.910
And I'm like,

1849
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:04.511
I need,

1850
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:05.170
if,

1851
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.580
if we're in Siberia,

1852
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.270
I need to see this mammoth because this is like the newest and baddest mammoth.

1853
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.830
I've got to see this thing.

1854
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.200
So we go and we track it down and we go into this,

1855
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.140
this permafrost fish locker and,

1856
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.390
and you'll see in the show,

1857
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:26.200
we were kind of like walking along and then we turn and there's this mammoth

1858
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:27.430
shape snowball.

1859
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.440
It's covered in snow and ice,

1860
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.870
but we're the first,

1861
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.430
the,

1862
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.741
again,

1863
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:37.360
the first Westerners because this had been found by a small group of people in

1864
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:39.820
this tiny little fishing village called [inaudible].

1865
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.680
No one had seen it yet.

1866
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.750
So it takes you,

1867
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.840
they find it and they find that they store it and hide it away.

1868
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.130
And then how does the word finally get to the paleontologist in Los Angeles?

1869
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.000
Um,

1870
00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:53.620
through,

1871
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.131
funny enough,

1872
00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:56.410
through Google and Twitter and things like that,

1873
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.310
there's this big,

1874
00:49:57.311 --> 00:49:59.830
if you search back to last May know is,

1875
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:00.640
may have,

1876
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.473
uh,

1877
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.920
may of 2012,

1878
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:03.131
no,

1879
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:04.540
it was may of 2013.

1880
00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.003
Um,

1881
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.181
uh,

1882
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:09.310
there was the bleeding mammoth that was found.

1883
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:10.750
It's the Lia Kowski mammoth.

1884
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.543
The,

1885
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:13.900
the Russians,

1886
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.170
uh,

1887
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.010
that founded,

1888
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.730
one of them is a paleontologist for the northeastern federal university.

1889
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.361
There it is.

1890
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:19.870
Yeah.

1891
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.703
Check it out.

1892
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.460
That's the,

1893
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.150
that's the goal.

1894
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.440
That's the bleeding mammoth.

1895
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.880
That was found way back then.

1896
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.250
And what that looks like a rock.

1897
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.130
Right?

1898
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.590
But you're actually looking at the front,

1899
00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:31.160
uh,

1900
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.650
left leg and uh,

1901
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.030
so it's totally frozen.

1902
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.590
Uh,

1903
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.820
it's like this rock,

1904
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.040
rock hard permafrost ball at this point.

1905
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.180
So you've got the front left leg and you've got the Scapula,

1906
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:44.930
the uh,

1907
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.990
so the very up underneath the discovery news logo there.

1908
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:48.981
That's the,

1909
00:50:48.981 --> 00:50:49.191
uh,

1910
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:50.120
that's where the mouth is.

1911
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:51.320
Whoa.

1912
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.153
But it's all,

1913
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.431
you know,

1914
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:57.431
it's completely frozen and this little thing and bleeding in what way is that?

1915
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:03.191
They found this goo leaking out of it or leaking out near it and it,

1916
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.220
it took the world by storm briefly and we're like,

1917
00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:07.551
okay,

1918
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:08.384
this is weird.

1919
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:09.650
I'm going to Siberia.

1920
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:10.700
I got to check this man without,

1921
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:11.600
it's got to be there.

1922
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.220
It didn't just like show up.

1923
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:13.581
People go,

1924
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:13.911
hey look,

1925
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:14.750
we've got liquid blood.

1926
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:15.560
Haha,

1927
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.520
we've got this mammoth.

1928
00:51:16.521 --> 00:51:17.900
And then they make it disappear.

1929
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:18.081
It's like,

1930
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:19.010
screw that man.

1931
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.420
I need to find this mammoth.

1932
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:23.450
If I'm kind of striking out finding other Mamet's,

1933
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.640
I've got to at least get my hands on one.

1934
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:31.050
And we managed to track that mammoth down and I brought on a whole slew of Jay,

1935
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.390
just this portable lab of an endoscope,

1936
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.980
a biological microscope.

1937
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:38.630
I was going to see if it has blood,

1938
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.800
look at the trunk tissue,

1939
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.160
look at all this stuff and like start this mini autopsy on a mammoth body.

1940
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.910
Wow.

1941
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.743
It was a trip.

1942
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.201
I mean you'll,

1943
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:49.001
you'll see it's,

1944
00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:50.570
it's really intense man.

1945
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:55.490
What's your feeling on these people that want to clone something like this?

1946
00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.373
Because this is,

1947
00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:56.850
yeah,

1948
00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:01.850
this is a real issue that we're heading into in 2014 where we actually have the

1949
00:52:02.211 --> 00:52:06.620
capability of doing something like this where they can take some DNA from some

1950
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:08.810
sort of a living dinosaur or living,

1951
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:09.360
um,

1952
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.193
elephant rather,

1953
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:13.890
and figure out a way to create a mammoth people.

1954
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:14.840
Yeah.

1955
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.310
People have been asking me this,

1956
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.233
um,

1957
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:17.631
uh,

1958
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:18.464
a lot,

1959
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:19.191
uh,

1960
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:19.641
recently,

1961
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:20.510
especially since we're,

1962
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.970
you know,

1963
00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:22.880
doing all the press for mammoth on earth here.

1964
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:23.961
They keep saying it's like,

1965
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:24.500
oh,

1966
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.370
it's like clone mammoths,

1967
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:25.910
clone mammoth.

1968
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.743
I,

1969
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.580
I don't believe,

1970
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:28.911
yes,

1971
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:30.080
we can probably do it.

1972
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.750
It'll probably take longer than we think.

1973
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:33.800
Maybe like 50,

1974
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:34.730
60 years.

1975
00:52:34.731 --> 00:52:36.590
It's not like a five from now.

1976
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.390
From now.

1977
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.880
Yeah.

1978
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.680
The way as technology advances,

1979
00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.440
I mean there was a Korean geneticists team,

1980
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.071
uh,

1981
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.860
on site while we were filming in case,

1982
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:46.160
uh,

1983
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.800
because they were also looking after looking for that mammoth.

1984
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:53.030
And I actually became really good friends with a couple of them and we were

1985
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:54.140
talking at length in there.

1986
00:52:54.141 --> 00:52:54.471
It's like,

1987
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:54.621
yeah,

1988
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:55.730
it's like maybe 50,

1989
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:57.500
60 years away from right now.

1990
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.260
But the problem is,

1991
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.920
at least in my personal and mildly,

1992
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:05.360
slightly professional view,

1993
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.470
it's unethical.

1994
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.713
Hmm.

1995
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.580
Why bring back an animal just to kill it?

1996
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.793
Why would you kill it?

1997
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.540
It would eventually die.

1998
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.350
It's,

1999
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.170
it's,

2000
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:16.490
uh,

2001
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.323
the,

2002
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:18.340
it,

2003
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.840
it would not have a mammoth life.

2004
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.160
The mammoth step,

2005
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:24.680
the environment that it would lived in is extinct.

2006
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:29.790
All other members of its species and genus for that matter are extinct.

2007
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.580
You could say that it was naturally selected to be,

2008
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.301
to be extinct.

2009
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:33.781
It was gone.

2010
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:37.860
It didn't survive be it get hunted by humans or whatever the prevailing theory

2011
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:38.694
is right now.

2012
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.700
That animal is no longer here.

2013
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:44.670
If we bring back one solitary individual,

2014
00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.050
how lonely,

2015
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.130
how has that ethical,

2016
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.160
we can figure out social aspects of of mammoths by watching their direct

2017
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.573
cousins.

2018
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.440
The elephant you,

2019
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:56.970
you put a rug on an elephant.

2020
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:57.361
There you go.

2021
00:53:57.361 --> 00:53:58.320
There's your woolly mammoth.

2022
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.490
Couldn't we have like an island called luck Paleolithic Park and have like a

2023
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:05.420
bunch of clone mammoths wander around and we have a,

2024
00:54:05.421 --> 00:54:07.100
a nice place where you could take your family.

2025
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.401
Look Connie,

2026
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:09.240
there's the mammoth.

2027
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.170
Let me tell you man.

2028
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:11.220
I mean I've been,

2029
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:16.250
I've helped a design like use paleontology and design like life size puppets,

2030
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:20.010
saber tooth cats and,

2031
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:20.821
and stuff like that.

2032
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:21.121
Yeah,

2033
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:25.230
I would love to see a dinosaur or a mammoth or a saber tooth cat or

2034
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:26.730
archaeopteryx,

2035
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:27.001
you know,

2036
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:28.170
some amazing,

2037
00:54:28.171 --> 00:54:29.220
awesome fossil.

2038
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:34.580
But these things are gone and it's more than just that the animal is no longer

2039
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.380
living in the environment it lived in is no longer there.

2040
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:39.150
We're not exactly sure what it ate.

2041
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.020
If we can pin down the exact grasses and everything that a woolly mammoth eight.

2042
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.790
What if they're extinct in the wild now we can't feed it what it would normally

2043
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:48.624
eat.

2044
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.730
Many kid eat fucking TV dinners.

2045
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:51.391
Who gives a shit?

2046
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:53.960
If I could look at them and I'm saying you can,

2047
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.060
they're frozen frozen carcasses that pop out of the ice.

2048
00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.350
Go check them out man.

2049
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.060
I completely see your point.

2050
00:55:00.061 --> 00:55:00.870
I totally understand.

2051
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.290
I'm only fucking around but no worries.

2052
00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.700
But the reality is if someone cloned a fucking dinosaur,

2053
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:06.480
I'm there.

2054
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.313
Oh yeah,

2055
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.160
absolutely.

2056
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.830
I bells on shit.

2057
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.920
I want to be that,

2058
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:13.380
that cliche moment of Dr. Grant,

2059
00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:14.191
Jurassic Park,

2060
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:18.510
like falling out of the jeep and like knocking his sunglasses off and going

2061
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:18.870
like,

2062
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:19.591
holy crap,

2063
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:20.630
that's a Fracchia soar.

2064
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.490
I want to see the t rex steal the goat from the road.

2065
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.300
Right,

2066
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.133
right.

2067
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.101
I'm going to be there.

2068
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:26.934
I want it.

2069
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.470
Chokes that thing down.

2070
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:29.920
Uh,

2071
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.940
just have a bunch of marines standing by with giant guns.

2072
00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:36.370
Like move you make one bad move,

2073
00:55:36.371 --> 00:55:38.220
but it's over dinosaur fuck face.

2074
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.180
I get it.

2075
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:41.490
The idea of that would be awesome.

2076
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.061
I mean,

2077
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:42.894
the idea of it,

2078
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:43.980
the idea of it,

2079
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:44.903
I mean,

2080
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.080
when it comes to a t rex,

2081
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:51.081
you're dealing with a 40 foot long animal that had 10,000 plus pounds of force

2082
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:54.480
per byte and Jesus rode it around 6,000 years ago.

2083
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:55.590
6,000 years ago.

2084
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.311
It was,

2085
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:57.144
I think it was,

2086
00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:57.600
yeah,

2087
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.520
6,000 years ago with Thursday.

2088
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.541
Funny,

2089
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:01.410
I think it was like Thursday,

2090
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:04.650
October 23rd [inaudible] 66,000 years ago.

2091
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:04.951
It's like,

2092
00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:08.220
it's the anniversary of Jesus riding the velociraptor in Nevada from Galilee

2093
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:09.054
right now.

2094
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.780
It seems inevitable though that some,

2095
00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:14.880
someone's going to do something along these lines.

2096
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:18.360
Like I agree with you that it's probably not ethical to Colona mammoth,

2097
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:21.750
but when you start collecting things like blood,

2098
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:22.584
you have like,

2099
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.580
like real genetic tissue.

2100
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:25.421
Uh,

2101
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:26.710
if there was any blood left,

2102
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:27.490
we would,

2103
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.370
there wasn't any blood.

2104
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.661
Now,

2105
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:30.310
the problem with the problem with,

2106
00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.153
uh,

2107
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.200
the same thing that would,

2108
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.270
if that happens to a mammoth,

2109
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.971
it's the same thing.

2110
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:35.110
If I put like,

2111
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.411
you know,

2112
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:36.880
myself and permafrost or you,

2113
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:37.361
anybody,

2114
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:39.790
it doesn't matter how fit you are,

2115
00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:40.640
how have,

2116
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:41.883
uh,

2117
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.450
adapted to the environment you are,

2118
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:44.380
anything like that.

2119
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.930
When a mammal self freezes,

2120
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.840
all the liquid inside freezes and the,

2121
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:50.290
uh,

2122
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:55.290
the ice crystals form and shatter the cell wall leaking out all of the genetic

2123
00:56:55.841 --> 00:56:57.190
material into this soup.

2124
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.241
Uh,

2125
00:56:58.241 --> 00:57:03.241
so you need an intact cell with a complete nucleus in order to even begin

2126
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:05.230
thinking about cloning.

2127
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:06.011
Really?

2128
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.291
Yeah.

2129
00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:07.124
That's fascinating.

2130
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.963
So you,

2131
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.730
we have the woolly mammoth genome,

2132
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.330
but we don't have the genetic information from a single individual to actually

2133
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.164
begin cloning.

2134
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.011
Oh.

2135
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:18.040
So that's why it would be like 40 or 50 years now acknowledged.

2136
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.320
He's just not quite at that level yet.

2137
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.730
And we don't have the evidence yet.

2138
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:25.270
We don't have the physical requirement of mammoth DNA.

2139
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:26.920
So when you're finding this Goo,

2140
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.240
what exactly is it?

2141
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:30.160
This is an exploded cell.

2142
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.370
It's exploded cells.

2143
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:32.813
Um,

2144
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:33.783
it's like,

2145
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:34.703
uh,

2146
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.560
blood like hemoglobin stained tissue and melted.

2147
00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:39.620
Um,

2148
00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.840
it's this,

2149
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.300
the same thing that would happen if you'd like,

2150
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.160
put a stake in a deep freezer for a year.

2151
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:48.430
And then take it out and let it sit on your counter for overnight.

2152
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:51.490
It just turns into this just cellular goo.

2153
00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.660
It's a stake in a deep freezer turned in Google.

2154
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.030
What do you mean?

2155
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.720
Yeah,

2156
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.381
if you let it.

2157
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:57.820
So after you thought out,

2158
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:00.970
it just starts to decompose after.

2159
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:01.850
How long are you talking about?

2160
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.480
Usually like a couple of days and started,

2161
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.721
you know,

2162
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:05.920
just leave it out at room temperature.

2163
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:06.754
It's kind of bad.

2164
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.960
But that's different than a regular piece of meat that you leave out in room

2165
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:11.651
temperature.

2166
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:11.920
No,

2167
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.720
no.

2168
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.241
Well yeah,

2169
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:14.830
actually it is once,

2170
00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.090
once the cells,

2171
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.650
once they get cold enough to burst the,

2172
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.890
they're still be cohesion.

2173
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:22.510
You'll still have like muscle tissue,

2174
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:25.480
but it'll start to leak out and be kind of gross.

2175
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:27.170
And it kind of starts us.

2176
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:27.610
We'll,

2177
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:30.250
at least when it comes to the man at the search to smell like a barnyard or

2178
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:33.070
really bad one because after all the ice,

2179
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:33.880
so we're,

2180
00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.810
we're checking it every,

2181
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.170
uh,

2182
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.070
every couple minutes,

2183
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:38.200
every hour or so with a thermal scanner.

2184
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.400
And at first it was all nice and solid and hard.

2185
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.120
And we drilled a couple holes through the tissue when it was hard in order to

2186
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:51.121
take core samples and look at muscle tissue and then we noticed this Goo,

2187
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:55.570
which is a combination of seller material and water,

2188
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:55.781
you know,

2189
00:58:55.781 --> 00:58:56.650
melting ice,

2190
00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.053
mud,

2191
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.750
what's left of blood and just grow,

2192
00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:03.940
starting to seep out of the holes and yeah,

2193
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:04.291
it's,

2194
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.410
it's kind of disgusting.

2195
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.730
It's pretty wild though.

2196
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.340
You're actually getting a liquid from this animal.

2197
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:12.010
There was exists that existed 40,000 years ago.

2198
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:12.820
Yeah.

2199
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:13.500
Wow.

2200
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.333
It's,

2201
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.880
it kind of messes with your head.

2202
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.840
Even if it was,

2203
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:18.700
we filmed it last year and it's just,

2204
00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:21.560
it's airing on Sunday and just the about it is like,

2205
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:22.280
no,

2206
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.810
this time last year I was still recovering from like poking a mammoth.

2207
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.100
Recovering.

2208
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:28.371
Yeah,

2209
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:29.320
just mentally recovering.

2210
00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:29.471
Oh,

2211
00:59:29.471 --> 00:59:29.810
I see.

2212
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:30.081
Yeah.

2213
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:30.690
It was just like,

2214
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:30.951
was like,

2215
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:31.041
no,

2216
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:33.140
I didn't get some like mammoth super flu or anything like,

2217
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.040
which would be cool.

2218
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.780
That is something to think about,

2219
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:36.041
right?

2220
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:36.160
Like,

2221
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:36.340
yes.

2222
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.850
Is it possible that baby rear or some diseases could survive bacteria and

2223
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:41.930
viruses and all that?

2224
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:44.060
They're much hardier than a human cell is.

2225
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.050
I know tricking,

2226
00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:45.923
there's some,

2227
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.850
there's some strains of tricking gnosis that can survive a deep freeze.

2228
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.980
They say that some strains of chicken gnosis uh,

2229
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.980
you can get from,

2230
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.490
uh,

2231
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.450
something that's been frozen for like years,

2232
00:59:57.451 --> 01:00:01.750
so he can take a piece of meat from an animal in his trick and Gnosis and it was

2233
01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:03.890
a couple of years thought out and cook it.

2234
01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:06.020
If you don't cook it to 160 degrees,

2235
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.710
you can get chicken houses,

2236
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:08.960
which is insane.

2237
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:13.610
That means those larva survived deep freeze for years.

2238
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.210
Yeah.

2239
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.350
What the fuck man?

2240
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:15.990
It's there.

2241
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.430
It's,

2242
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.820
that's,

2243
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.590
that's evolution right there.

2244
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:19.460
That's like,

2245
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:19.940
nope.

2246
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.390
You know,

2247
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.960
we're gonna,

2248
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.300
we're gonna hang out and be hardy and just,

2249
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.613
you know,

2250
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.041
the,

2251
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.840
the weaker ones die nature.

2252
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.501
Scary dude.

2253
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:27.701
Yeah.

2254
01:00:27.701 --> 01:00:28.670
Nature is totally scary.

2255
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.440
That's why it's scary to clone a mammoth,

2256
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:30.681
right?

2257
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:31.700
Because who knows what you would,

2258
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:35.100
what kind of fucking crazy new plague I think,

2259
01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:35.690
think uh,

2260
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:36.051
what is it?

2261
01:00:36.051 --> 01:00:40.010
Jurassic Park to the t rex goes and destroys San Diego and then all of a sudden

2262
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:41.960
we have like a rampant woolly mammoth,

2263
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:42.920
like tearing apart,

2264
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.550
you know,

2265
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:44.570
downtown Seoul.

2266
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:45.020
I mean,

2267
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.501
that shit.

2268
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.550
That shit so quick.

2269
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.000
Yeah.

2270
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
True of big 14 light that fucker up like a Christmas tree and then we'd all have

2271
01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:53.570
made mistakes.

2272
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:57.760
I wanted to actually try piece of the meat from the mammoth.

2273
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.431
Yeah.

2274
01:00:58.431 --> 01:00:59.264
They wouldn't let me.

2275
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.210
He really wanted to eat and really wanting to try it.

2276
01:01:01.211 --> 01:01:01.400
Yeah.

2277
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.300
Why would you do that?

2278
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.490
Why not?

2279
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:07.700
Because it's 40,000 years old and you could just have a sandwich instead.

2280
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.510
I'm already,

2281
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.520
I'm already doing the once in a lifetime thing.

2282
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.800
Everybody has to fucking,

2283
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.051
well,

2284
01:01:13.051 --> 01:01:14.540
I have to take it into my body.

2285
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.130
Well,

2286
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:15.570
I come on,

2287
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:16.190
I already,

2288
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.570
at this point it's,

2289
01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:18.404
I'd had,

2290
01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:19.010
you know,

2291
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.900
I've been finding mammoth bones.

2292
01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:22.670
I've been drinking reindeer blood.

2293
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.380
Come on after a barbarian and this point wearing like leather underwear.

2294
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.700
Yeah.

2295
01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.533
No,

2296
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.260
I still,

2297
01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:34.730
the Parka actually still smells like mammoth now that I know that you mentioned

2298
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:35.060
that.

2299
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:35.510
Really?

2300
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:36.343
Yeah.

2301
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.640
I wouldn't wash it either.

2302
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:39.000
Why was the washing part in it?

2303
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.520
Don't you don't want to,

2304
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.160
it's a smells like an animal in that live 40,000 years ago.

2305
01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:44.690
That's pretty damn cool.

2306
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.553
Right?

2307
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.820
Wow.

2308
01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.430
So is this the ultimate for you to be able to find this,

2309
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.570
this animal,

2310
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.520
the woolly mammoth carcass?

2311
01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:52.970
It,

2312
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:53.661
it really was.

2313
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:53.841
I mean,

2314
01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:54.920
it was an absolute dream come true.

2315
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:55.191
I mean,

2316
01:01:55.191 --> 01:01:55.880
you'll,

2317
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.070
you'll see in the show on the Sunday night it airs.

2318
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.331
Yeah.

2319
01:01:58.331 --> 01:01:58.940
It's a,

2320
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.160

2321
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.210

Um,

2326
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:06.740
I can already hear it in my head.

2327
01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:07.041
It's like,

2328
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:08.120
don't mess up the name.

2329

Because I'm throwing a party at my friend's bar.

Is that technically like silver lake?

2362
01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.360
That's a new way of saying silver lake,

2363
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.391
east Hollywood.

2364
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:07.590
We're in this weird little,

2365
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.090
it's,

2366
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:12.360
it's this bizarre place where we're not quite Los Felis.

2367
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.840
We're not quite silver lake and echo park and we're not quite Korea town.

2368
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.620
You should just run out there and buy real estate for East Hollywood right now

2369
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.600
just because the fact that you've said that,

2370
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:23.610
it's kind of like this cool new spot.

2371
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.653
People like cheese,

2372
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:25.883
that's the new place.

2373
01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.550
Fucking mad scramble to buy real estate in east Hollywood.

2374
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:32.310
I've been there for three years now and create a market,

2375
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:34.050
but it's weirdly enough,

2376
01:03:34.051 --> 01:03:35.730
it's already starting to do it of course,

2377
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.200
because it's like there's the hip,

2378
01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:37.471
like,

2379
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:37.711
you know,

2380
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.431
craft beer,

2381
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:39.121
wine place.

2382
01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:39.420
So that,

2383
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.231
that my friends got,

2384
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:42.180
and then like the boutique ice cream,

2385
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:43.080
the tattoo shop,

2386
01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:44.310
the crossfit place,

2387
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:44.881
you know,

2388
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:46.170
it's just like in this one corner.

2389
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.340
I love that area.

2390
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.840
I Love Los Felis.

2391
01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:49.910
I love silver leg.

2392
01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.060
I don't live there,

2393
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.070
but my buddy Duncan does and I,

2394
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.100
whenever I go to visit them,

2395
01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.140
we walk around his neighborhood.

2396
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:55.351
I'm like,

2397
01:03:55.351 --> 01:03:55.461
dude,

2398
01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:56.940
this is the weirdest part of La.

2399
01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:59.550
It's like this is a Melrose in Vermont,

2400
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.990
Melrose in Vermont.

2401
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:02.430
No Rosen heliotrope right there.

2402
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:02.910
Wow.

2403
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:03.870
That's a great,

2404
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.753
weird little like,

2405
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.960
it's like boutique antique shop.

2406
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:08.010
Really.

2407
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.690
It's like three blocks down.

2408
01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:10.890
Somebody just got shot.

2409
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.080
This is bizarre.

2410
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:14.550
So,

2411
01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:14.940
uh,

2412
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:15.241
yeah,

2413
01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:15.511
it's,

2414
01:04:15.511 --> 01:04:16.140
it's crazy.

2415
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:16.231
Oh,

2416
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:16.921
that sucks man.

2417
01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:19.710
That'd be Rad if you could come do my friend.

2418
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.140
[inaudible] it does sound pretty bad ass though.

2419
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.380
Yeah.

2420
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.730
So airline mammoth.

2421
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.110
And now that you've done this,

2422
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:25.800
what,

2423
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.880
what's next for you?

2424
01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:27.210
I mean,

2425
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.220
this is essentially the ultimate view.

2426
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:29.970
Uh,

2427
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:30.540
yeah.

2428
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.070
I,

2429
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:33.630
I mean I found a woolly mammoth.

2430
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:34.920
Well one,

2431
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:40.610
I went to northeastern Siberia where very few American paleontologists ever go.

2432
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:48.110
I'm one of the few people to actually touch and interact with a actual like

2433
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.620
woolly mammoth carcass.

2434
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.210
It's kind of,

2435
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:52.050
it is right now.

2436
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:53.190
It is the ultimate for me,

2437
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:53.611
but man,

2438
01:04:53.611 --> 01:04:58.020
I don't know what's next and like how can I top that other than like digging out

2439
01:04:58.021 --> 01:05:03.021
a tyrannosaur in the middle of Montana or there is a lot of that in Montana,

2440
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:03.320
right?

2441
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.780
Yeah.

2442
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.070
Montana is a huge,

2443
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.940
it's a,

2444
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:07.170
because there was like a,

2445
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.150
it's called the western interior seaway.

2446
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:13.620
It connected the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico and that's why Kansas and

2447
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:13.951
all that,

2448
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:15.150
that's all good farmland.

2449
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.130
It's because it was underwater.

2450
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.100
So Montana,

2451
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:18.730
Utah,

2452
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:19.241
that they were,

2453
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:20.500
they were swampy areas.

2454
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.430
Yeah.

2455
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.320
I've been to the area,

2456
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:27.220
the bad lands in Montana and those mountains where you're walking around on

2457
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:27.910
silt.

2458
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:28.330
Yeah.

2459
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.840
The mountains are covered with what was essentially the bottom of the great

2460
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:33.040
western inland sea.

2461
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:33.320
Yeah.

2462
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:33.760
Yeah.

2463
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.151
So yeah,

2464
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:38.140
the Dakota's a all that they find sell shells up there.

2465
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:38.531
Yeah.

2466
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:39.400
Like seashells.

2467
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:39.910
Yeah.

2468
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:40.631
Which is just like,

2469
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:41.800
what the fuck?

2470
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:42.190
Mike,

2471
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.800
Mike coworker at Swca Lee,

2472
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:47.650
he's like a tried and true Montana paleontologist.

2473
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:50.650
He's had his hand in more t rex skeletons than anybody I know.

2474
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:51.310
Wow.

2475
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:51.611
He's,

2476
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:52.060
he's a,

2477
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.410
he's a really cool dude.

2478
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.670
And uh,

2479
01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.890
did they find mega dawns in Montana as well?

2480
01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.793
Oh,

2481
01:05:58.810 --> 01:05:59.620
I don't know.

2482
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.640
They do in Bakersfield.

2483
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.541
Bakersfield,

2484
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.170
California.

2485
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:02.770
Yeah.

2486
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:03.603
Walk just up north.

2487
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.533
Yeah.

2488
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:04.751
Yeah.

2489
01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:07.210
There's actually a place called shark's tooth hill because they found,

2490
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:08.740
they found meg meg teeth there.

2491
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:10.240
Wow.

2492
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.660
Yeah.

2493
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.000
Chilay um,

2494
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.400
there's ones that are out in the Carolinas and Georgia and Florida,

2495
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.040
uh,

2496
01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.080
all over the place.

2497
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:17.831
Yeah.

2498
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:18.131
They're,

2499
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:19.390
they're fantastic man.

2500
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.870
How much does it piss you off when you see those shows where they pretend that

2501
01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:25.300
they have footage of a mega don those?

2502
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.870
Have you seen that goofy shit where they actually have fake photos from like

2503
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:29.704
World War II?

2504
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:34.770
I purposely don't watch them because then my blood sugar goes up and I probably

2505
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:38.410
end up doing a Twitter tirade and my girlfriend would get mad at me.

2506
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.300
And why would she get mad at you for a Twitter tirade?

2507
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.163
Oh,

2508
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.990
there was one time I think in like two days.

2509
01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.630
I,

2510
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:47.620
I did like over a thousand tweets just like debating people.

2511
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.770
It's just because it becomes all focused.

2512
01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:51.040
I've,

2513
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.610
I'm just,

2514
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:51.850
you know,

2515
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.740
my brain's kind of wired different than,

2516
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:54.610
than a lot of people.

2517
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.630
I will just focus a nitpick and just go nuts and she's just like,

2518
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:59.201
you know,

2519
01:06:59.201 --> 01:07:00.250
you could be doing,

2520
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.680
I,

2521
01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.400
I'm not going to scroll through hundreds of tweets.

2522
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:04.660
It's like,

2523
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.441
what's going on?

2524
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:05.800
I'm like,

2525
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.160
oh,

2526
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:06.580
I,

2527
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.040
I was making a point.

2528
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.870
He was saying there were gaps in the fossil record and yeah.

2529
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:11.740
Oh,

2530
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.940
it was it one of those dudes who,

2531
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:14.150
one of the evolutionary yeah,

2532
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:14.800
yeah.

2533
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.520
Deniers.

2534
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.270
Yeah.

2535
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:16.511
Yeah.

2536
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:17.330
That's,

2537
01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:17.580
uh,

2538
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.120
unfortunately incredibly common.

2539
01:07:19.121 --> 01:07:19.954
But yeah,

2540
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:20.651
I've,

2541
01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:21.250
uh,

2542
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.230
unfortunately credibly common in the US,

2543
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.460
not in other places.

2544
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:25.030
No.

2545
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:25.450
Really?

2546
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:26.080
No.

2547
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.420
We're one of the highest rates of evolution,

2548
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:30.700
denial and science denial in the entire world.

2549
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:31.810
What do you tribute that to?

2550
01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:32.943
Um,

2551
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.143
corn,

2552
01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:35.763
GMO corn?

2553
01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.371
Is that what it is?

2554
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:37.750
Months Sato it's chem trails.

2555
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:38.584
It's nothing.

2556
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.420
Not even gonna get started in on all that,

2557
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:41.250
man.

2558
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:41.891
I'm again,

2559
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:42.561
I'm a scientist.

2560
01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:43.394
They need data.

2561
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.493
Um,

2562
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.090
I don't,

2563
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:46.661
I don't know.

2564
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:47.280
Maybe it's,

2565
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.400
it's freedom.

2566
01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.780
It's actual freedom.

2567
01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:51.790
It's the freedom to believe.

2568
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:54.550
It's the freedom to have faith.

2569
01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.270
It's,

2570
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.740
it's great.

2571
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.830
It's a great thing to have.

2572
01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:57.970
It's a great thing to question.

2573
01:07:57.971 --> 01:07:58.840
I don't knock that.

2574
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.160
I don't knock religions.

2575
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:00.994
I don't knock.

2576
01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.560
I've a lot of people that are religious.

2577
01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:03.730
I have a lot of people that are atheists,

2578
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:04.930
that are all good friends of mine.

2579
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:06.700
I do not in any way,

2580
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.800
shape or form care what you believe.

2581
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.780
Just keep it out of my science.

2582
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:11.741
Don't,

2583
01:08:11.741 --> 01:08:12.760
don't tell me that,

2584
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:14.650
you know,

2585
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.370
300 years of geology

2586
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.203
<v 1>is wrong.</v>

2587
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.531
Don't tell me that.

2588
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:20.660
I'm effectively lying to the public.

2589
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:22.220
The public.

2590
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.130
Do you know that the earth is 6,000 years old?

2591
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.620
Actually.

2592
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.071
Exactly.

2593
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:25.400
Man.

2594
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.060
They had a recent Gallup poll that was some,

2595
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.120
something insane.

2596
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:34.121
Like 46% of Americans believe that the earth is less than 10,000 years old.

2597
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.243
Yeah.

2598
01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.400
10,000 years or last year.

2599
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:37.070
Something like that.

2600
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.903
That hurts.

2601
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.750
Yeah.

2602
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.440
I that that,

2603
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.440
that directly flies into my entire way of thought,

2604
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:46.790
feeling and all of that and yes,

2605
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.770
I let it be instead of just like,

2606
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.010
you know,

2607
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.050
putting my blinders on and going through just like doot,

2608
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:51.201
doot,

2609
01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:51.830
Doo Doo.

2610
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:52.430
That's cool.

2611
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.760
Yeah,

2612
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.920
but to keep it out of my science,

2613
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:59.780
I kind of feel like that's the last crazy gasp of,

2614
01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:00.200
uh,

2615
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:00.650
this,

2616
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:02.750
this sort of a science denial.

2617
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.651
I feel like this,

2618
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:06.860
what we're experiencing right now is the last crazy gasp of it.

2619
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.963
As we,

2620
01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:08.870
we're,

2621
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:09.141
we're,

2622
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:11.690
we're in this incredible age of information,

2623
01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.530
but I believe that even what we're experiencing right now will pale in

2624
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:20.450
comparison to the access to data that we'll have and just 20 or 30 years that

2625
01:09:20.451 --> 01:09:22.430
it'll be something symbiotics.

2626
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:23.800
I'm some chip or something.

2627
01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:28.820
Having your brain where it'll almost be impossible to deny because we kind of

2628
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:33.650
have like a symbiotic connection with technology mean you essentially everyone

2629
01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:34.760
feels lost without their phone.

2630
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:36.050
You put on glasses,

2631
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:36.771
what has glasses,

2632
01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:40.020
it's technology that's allowing you to see when you really can't see that

2633
01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.560
there's going to be something that's going to be better than glasses.

2634
01:09:42.561 --> 01:09:44.170
We do have what's called contact lenses.

2635
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:44.421
Okay.

2636
01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:45.800
Now it's on my eyeball.

2637
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.270
No,

2638
01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:50.660
he's actually in a print something in your eyeball and it's permanent and you

2639
01:09:50.661 --> 01:09:53.120
never have to worry about it breaking and it's a simple procedure.

2640
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:53.510
Okay.

2641
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:54.200
We'll do it.

2642
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:54.441
Okay.

2643
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.251
Your memory sucks.

2644
01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:57.770
So we're going to do is we're going to give you a chip and we're going to,

2645
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.810
all your memories would now be stored on your chip.

2646
01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:02.750
You'll be able to plug in and send them to your friends.

2647
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:03.190
Okay.

2648
01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:03.860
Is it painful?

2649
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.101
No,

2650
01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:04.281
no,

2651
01:10:04.281 --> 01:10:04.461
no.

2652
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.150
You don't feel a thing.

2653
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.451
Okay.

2654
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:06.170
We'll do that.

2655
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:07.250
And then boom,

2656
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:07.431
boom,

2657
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:07.641
boom,

2658
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:07.821
boom.

2659
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:10.640
And it's going to get to a point where there is 6,000 years old.

2660
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.090
No,

2661
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.550
it's not.

2662
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:12.410
Fuckface come here.

2663
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.543
Come over here.

2664
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.240
Boom.

2665
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.020
I'm going to show you the actual evolution of the earth itself.

2666
01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:21.320
You'll be able to see in the next 10 minutes how we've proven that.

2667
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.430
I think.

2668
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:27.080
I think it's the last gasp of the science denialism that we see right now.

2669
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:28.490
I think it's the last gasp.

2670
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:30.770
I kind of hope so,

2671
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.600
and I think within a hundred years it's going to be over.

2672
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.460
That'd be,

2673
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.293
that would be rad.

2674
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.120
Um,

2675
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.930
that'd be really rad.

2676
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:37.010
It seems like it has to be.

2677
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:37.410
It,

2678
01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:37.720
it,

2679
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.020
it,

2680
01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.410
it doesn't seem like it has to be.

2681
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:40.244
It needs to be.

2682
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:45.790
It needs to be because that's what's holding us back as a species is it's like

2683
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.810
personal beliefs.

2684
01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:52.430
I just read this fantastic article on the difference between belief where

2685
01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:53.264
somebody says,

2686
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.080
I believe in,

2687
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.910
I believe the earth is four and a half billion years old or I believe it's 6,000

2688
01:10:58.911 --> 01:10:59.744
years old.

2689
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:04.550
One is I believe factually that the earth has four and a half billion.

2690
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.410
It's like I believe I have faith in.

2691
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:12.490
We need to figure out how to keep those both within the public

2692
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.520
<v 0>thought,</v>

2693
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.520
both within the idea that it's perfectly okay to have these sorts of beliefs,

2694
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.530
but science doesn't impact religion.

2695
01:11:22.531 --> 01:11:25.770
We're not out to kill God or anything like that.

2696
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.680
We're just out to ask questions or the way you said that,

2697
01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:30.030
it makes me think you want to kill God.

2698
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.361
No,

2699
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:30.781
I don't.

2700
01:11:30.781 --> 01:11:31.614
I don't care.

2701
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:32.970
I don't care.

2702
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:34.140
It's completely irreverent.

2703
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.800
Yeah.

2704
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.410
You cannot disprove an unprovable.

2705
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.280
It's there.

2706
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:38.850
Why?

2707
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:39.511
Why even bought?

2708
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:40.590
Why waste the time?

2709
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.101
Well,

2710
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:41.934
it's just folks.

2711
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.470
I think the existential angst that comes along with being a human being,

2712
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:50.070
it's very difficult to manage and there's a lot of people that look for all

2713
01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:55.071
sorts of tools and vehicles for distributing their,

2714
01:11:56.370 --> 01:12:01.370
just the anxiety of being alive and they take comfort in some strange things.

2715
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.570
I've had these conversations with people before where they defend religion by

2716
01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:08.610
the fact that it gives people comfort and like,

2717
01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:09.444
okay,

2718
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.010
that's all well and good man,

2719
01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:11.820
but you know,

2720
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.330
whoa.

2721
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:15.870
Think about how many great people have been Christian and great people have

2722
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:16.530
believed in real.

2723
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:17.610
That's all well and good,

2724
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:18.900
but it doesn't mean anything.

2725
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.650
The reality of what we can measure,

2726
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.640
what we can prove,

2727
01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:24.600
what we can show,

2728
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.920
what we've learned,

2729
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.020
if that is in any way impacted by these people who believe things.

2730
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:32.610
If it's in hindered,

2731
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:33.271
retarded,

2732
01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:34.290
slowed down,

2733
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.150
diverted in any way,

2734
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:41.160
then those belief systems are fucking dangerous was they're confusing and they

2735
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:43.380
get in the way of our understanding.

2736
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.110
As much as we know now,

2737
01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:51.111
we know an incredible amount with still in unbelievably limited amount of

2738
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:54.810
information we have in comparison to what's actually out there for us.

2739
01:12:54.811 --> 01:12:59.811
To discover and we have an just an a measurable amount of competing data too,

2740
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.800
which is kind of the problem.

2741
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.010
It's having competing data is fine.

2742
01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:13.011
Having data that has completely thrown together with confirmation bias and,

2743
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:13.801
oh no,

2744
01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:16.170
it has to be this because I don't like that.

2745
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.831
It's like,

2746
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:18.660
just let the method do its job.

2747
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.711
Let Science,

2748
01:13:19.711 --> 01:13:21.750
let science as a tool.

2749
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:24.030
You don't win when you break a hammer,

2750
01:13:24.031 --> 01:13:24.440
you,

2751
01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.320
you bitch at the tool,

2752
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:28.290
but it's your fault that you didn't see the crack or anything like that in it

2753
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.090
sciences,

2754
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:33.720
the tool use the tool the way it's the way it's supposed to be used.

2755
01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:34.920
Let it test things,

2756
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:35.840
let it do that.

2757
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.360
It's,

2758
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.250
it doesn't mean it doesn't have any malice.

2759
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:39.690
The nice thing is,

2760
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:40.051
you know what?

2761
01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:40.884
If you're wrong,

2762
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:43.650
that's rad because if you're wrong,

2763
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.220
that means you can come up with a whole new idea of cool shit to do.

2764
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.390
You found some new stuff.

2765
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:48.980
Yeah.

2766
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:52.500
You having a negative is a positive.

2767
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.070
Having a negative result means that it's something else,

2768
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.001
which is cool.

2769
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:58.320
It's an unanswered question.

2770
01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:59.760
If you answer the question,

2771
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:00.091
cool,

2772
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:00.750
refine it,

2773
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.583
make it better.

2774
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:03.781
Again,

2775
01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:06.330
personal beliefs are fucking Rad,

2776
01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:06.751
man.

2777
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:11.280
If it makes you a better person and it's another tool in your basket to use,

2778
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.160
whether it's digging up a mammoth or finding the cure for cancer,

2779
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:15.941
by all means,

2780
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:16.774
please use it.

2781
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:19.240
Just don't bring it into science.

2782
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:20.700
Don't have confirmation bias.

2783
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.970
Don't do you know,

2784
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.421
oh,

2785
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:22.641
we,

2786
01:14:22.641 --> 01:14:23.420
we can't.

2787
01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:23.660
Uh,

2788
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.320
we can't believe that because of the earth is only 6,000 years old.

2789
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:28.360
Why are you doing that?

2790
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.280
Why are you going against hundreds of years of geology and science and

2791
01:14:33.281 --> 01:14:37.060
technology and all of this stuff that we've already unlocked?

2792
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.020
That was the stopes.

2793
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.020
That's the problem is planning.

2794
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:40.450
Dopes.

2795
01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:40.840
They're something.

2796
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.890
It's easy to be a dumb dumb.

2797
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.320
We got a real cushy life.

2798
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.000
It's easy to be negative and it's easy to,

2799
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:46.301
yeah,

2800
01:14:46.301 --> 01:14:47.200
it's easy to be stupid.

2801
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:47.501
Yeah.

2802
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:49.450
Those are two really easy things to be.

2803
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.930
Oh,

2804
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.920
I'm always negative.

2805
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.760
Oddly enough.

2806
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.220
Yeah.

2807
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:52.450
Well,

2808
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:55.120
the Twitter rants thousand tweets in a day.

2809
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.531
I want to go outside,

2810
01:14:56.531 --> 01:14:57.280
dude.

2811
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:57.740
No,

2812
01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.050
but I'm usually outside.

2813
01:14:59.051 --> 01:14:59.884
That's the thing.

2814
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:00.711
That's true,

2815
01:15:00.711 --> 01:15:00.940
right?

2816
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:01.210
Work.

2817
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:01.721
It's slow.

2818
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.960
I'm waiting for the excavator,

2819
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.660
blew a hydraulic line and I'm just like,

2820
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:04.781
Doo,

2821
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:05.290
Doo Doo.

2822
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:06.880
Oh you motherfucker.

2823
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:08.860
And then you just go off on a,

2824
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:09.130
yeah.

2825
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:09.461
And then,

2826
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:09.641
you know,

2827
01:15:09.641 --> 01:15:11.320
I make my point and then they come back.

2828
01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:11.621
I'm like,

2829
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:11.801
no,

2830
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:12.491
you're not getting it.

2831
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:14.200
And then I make my point again and then they come back.

2832
01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:14.411
I'm like,

2833
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:14.531
no,

2834
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:15.430
you're still not getting it.

2835
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.810
Here's a 43 page pdf on 55 million years of horse evolution.

2836
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:20.231
Oh,

2837
01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:21.250
it's all the same kind.

2838
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.313
Do you,

2839
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.180
do you think that you're being trolled ever?

2840
01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:27.310
Do you think people recognize that you do this?

2841
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.383
Well,

2842
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.030
kind of because I follow a few accounts,

2843
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:31.780
uh,

2844
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.420
that actually purposely retweet them.

2845
01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.880
They retweet the stupid on purpose,

2846
01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.540
on purpose.

2847
01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.373
Just to start.

2848
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:38.630
Yeah.

2849
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.940
If,

2850
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.240
if man came from monkeys,

2851
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:41.500
why are there still monkeys?

2852
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:42.490
That's my thing.

2853
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:45.280
That's why I was telling him because we didn't come from monkeys,

2854
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:45.580
man,

2855
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.390
Bro.

2856
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.223
You don't even know.

2857
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:47.710
Right,

2858
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.543
right.

2859
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:49.060
Okay.

2860
01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.680
Now you see if,

2861
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:51.120
uh,

2862
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:51.830
whoa,

2863
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:52.660
um,

2864
01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:52.931
yeah.

2865
01:15:52.931 --> 01:15:53.291
It's like,

2866
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:56.020
take that Darwin Renew retweets that question.

2867
01:15:56.021 --> 01:15:56.771
That's all he does.

2868
01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:58.150
And he gets into debates and it's like,

2869
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:59.410
that's okay,

2870
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.320
I'll follow that one says take that Darwin.

2871
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.531
No,

2872
01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:02.671
that,

2873
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:03.491
that's the account.

2874
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:04.324
Take that Darwin.

2875
01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:04.500
Oh,

2876
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.070
that's funny.

2877
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.380
Yeah.

2878
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.213
I need to check that out.

2879
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:10.750
And then there was also like theory fail theory fail when people say evolution

2880
01:16:10.751 --> 01:16:12.730
is fake because it's just a theory.

2881
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:13.001
Oh,

2882
01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:13.571
that's great.

2883
01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:17.500
It's like theory is the biggest thing ever.

2884
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.560
And science heard intelligent people who are educated biologists are being

2885
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:27.751
referred to as non Darwinists or they believe in a non Darwinian form of,

2886
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:29.423
of evolution.

2887
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:30.100
What,

2888
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.000
what other potential forms of evolution are there or what?

2889
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.990
Or are hypothesized the mirror that people believe?

2890
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.610
I that I'm not that sure on to be honest.

2891
01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:42.870
I,

2892
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:43.390
I have no,

2893
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:47.290
I've never heard that a non darn when neo Darwinist on,

2894
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:48.020
on,

2895
01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:48.670
on Darwinian,

2896
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.630
I've never,

2897
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.493
never heard that.

2898
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.500
Really?

2899
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:51.700
Yeah.

2900
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.140
Maybe I'm just hanging out with idiots.

2901
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.823
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2902
01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.670
<v 0>Non Darwinian evolution.</v>

2903
01:16:58.740 --> 01:16:59.573
I'll Google it.

2904
01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.241
Yeah.

2905
01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:06.050
It's a scholarly articles for non Darwinian evolution.

2906
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:06.660
Oh Wow.

2907
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.910
Oh Wow.

2908
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2909
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.741
Um,

2910
01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:13.820
scientific paper written by Jack Lester King Thomas H.

2911
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.620
Duke's published in 1969 is credited along with a moot Motu.

2912
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:23.650
Kimora was 1968 paper evolutionary rate of the molecular level at the molecular

2913
01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:24.650
level,

2914
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:29.650
proposing what became known as the neutral theory of molecular evolution paper

2915
01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:33.350
brings together a wide variety of evidence ranging from protein sequence

2916
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:38.351
comparisons to studies of the Trevor's mutated gene and ECO lie.

2917
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.630
Trevor's mutater gene.

2918
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.473
Cool.

2919
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.440
Troffers two F's,

2920
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:43.580
um,

2921
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:44.091
uh,

2922
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:45.430
analysis of the genetic blah,

2923
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:45.671
blah,

2924
01:17:45.671 --> 01:17:45.931

Definitely.

2932
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:51.950
These other interviews that I'm doing today.

2933
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.610
Yeah.

2934
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.210
Oh Man.

2935
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.170
Who else are you doing today?

2936
01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.113
Um,

2937
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.330
Marilu Henner,

2938
01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.050
Marilu Henner and she'll like a gymnast or something?

2939
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:00.321
No,

2940
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:00.721
the,

2941
01:18:00.721 --> 01:18:01.610
the actress.

2942
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.480
Um,

2943
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.313
she was on taxi.

2944
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.041
Oh,

2945
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:05.170
Marilu Henner all the,

2946
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.410
the redheaded lady.

2947
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:07.170
Yeah.

2948
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:07.720
And she,

2949
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:07.940
uh,

2950
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.050
it's really cool.

2951
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:09.171
Uh,

2952
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:09.471
yeah,

2953
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:10.120
she has,

2954
01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.510
she's supposed to be a genius.

2955
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:11.990
I,

2956
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.260
she,

2957
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.130
she has a photograph,

2958
01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.090
like a bizarre,

2959
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:14.870
amazing,

2960
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:16.160
awesome photographic memory.

2961
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:18.290
She could remember the very day,

2962
01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:19.220
the time,

2963
01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:24.221
like of 1979 it was in my living room.

2964
01:18:24.441 --> 01:18:26.900
It was 12:00 PM and this happened.

2965
01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:27.800
And Yeah.

2966
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.591
And,

2967
01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:32.990
and weirdly in this big grand synthesis of the world,

2968
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:38.530
she filmed a movie in my girlfriend's old home in Toronto,

2969
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.200
like in 94 and has assigned headshot.

2970
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.110
My girlfriend has a sign headshot from Marilu Henner,

2971
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.250
so like,

2972
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.690
wow.

2973
01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:46.830
Yeah.

2974
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:47.571
And I'm going to ask her,

2975
01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:48.021
I'm going to like,

2976
01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:48.321
Hey,

2977
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:49.520
do you remember like this,

2978
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:49.881
this,

2979
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:51.110
this house in Toronto?

2980
01:18:51.111 --> 01:18:51.710
She does.

2981
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:52.700
And she'll probably like,

2982
01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:53.181
oh yeah.

2983
01:18:53.181 --> 01:18:53.660
And the,

2984
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.750
it was near a thing with that and the wallpaper was this color,

2985
01:18:56.751 --> 01:18:59.150
which was kind of like air crew and it was just like,

2986
01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.013
whoa.

2987
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.010
And she's a very rare example of that.

2988
01:19:02.011 --> 01:19:02.180
Right?

2989
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:02.601
Extremely.

2990
01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:03.434
Extremely.

2991
01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.590
I actually think I got to be bugging off to get to that.

2992
01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:07.190
Is it,

2993
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.010
does she have a podcast or something gets syndicated?

2994
01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:10.670
Radio?

2995
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:13.190
I'm Marilu Henner is a syndicated radio show.

2996
01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:13.580
Yeah.

2997
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.241
That's amazing.

2998
01:19:14.241 --> 01:19:14.511
What's it,

2999
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:16.940
what's the subjects about anything she wants?

3000
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:17.691
No Kid.

3001
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:18.524
Yeah,

3002
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:19.780
it's Mary Lou.

3003
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.360
Uh,

3004
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:20.541
yeah,

3005
01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:20.901
on Twitter.

3006
01:19:20.901 --> 01:19:21.920
It's at Mary Lou show.

3007
01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.440
Asar interviewed once and I was like,

3008
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:24.651
wow.

3009
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:26.150
She surprisingly intelligent.

3010
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.140
Yeah.

3011
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:30.080
And that whole photographic memory thing.

3012
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.650
Right.

3013
01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:31.281
That's a bummer.

3014
01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:32.114
If you date her though,

3015
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:35.810
you know you can't say that.

3016
01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:36.490
Oh,

3017
01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:36.870
Oh yes,

3018

3026
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:49.580
I totally understand.

3027
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.350
This is amazing.
