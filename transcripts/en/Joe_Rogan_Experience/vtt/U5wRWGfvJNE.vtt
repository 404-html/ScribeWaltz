<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it would change the consciousness period.</v>

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings would develop a completely different sense of reality</v>

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>completely different cells of our perspective in the universe.</v>

6
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's terms that I didn't mind expanding.</v>

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get one.</v>

8
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Probably took a small dose.</v>

9
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>How much do I need to take?</v>

10
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Five grams usually in darkness.</v>

11
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>If you can get an isolation tank,</v>

12
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.414
<v Speaker 1>go that way.</v>

13
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a pussy.</v>

14
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about mushrooms and you haven't gotten the big route.</v>

15
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.373
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

16
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you've dipped your toes in the water.</v>

18
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>You haven't jumped into the ocean.</v>

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you my mushroom story?</v>

20
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>

21
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>With some friends we went camping,</v>

23
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>we were doing mushrooms and uh,</v>

24
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>we're all standing in this lake in Idaho,</v>

25
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>with some redneck families camping all around us and we're like two gay guys and</v>

27
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>straight go straight.</v>

28
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Couple and were just tripping out of our minds are mushrooms that we're</v>

29
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:49.681
<v Speaker 1>standing.</v>

30
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like in these fish are nibbling or the hairs on her legs and we're all</v>

31
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

32
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.813
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

33
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And then suddenly there's a boat going back and forth in front of us that has</v>

34
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>dare the drug resistance education logo,</v>

35
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the police boat that's going back and forth in front of us.</v>

36
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And then a prop airplane comes right at us.</v>

37
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>We're like standing there and this airplane is like,</v>

38
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>we see it in the sky,</v>

39
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>it's getting lower and lower.</v>

40
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>It's pointed right at us.</v>

41
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It comes over right at us at the boat.</v>

42
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:16.704
<v Speaker 1>And we were all like,</v>

43
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>are we see?</v>

44
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Are you seeing each other?</v>

45
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And then the airplane went right over our heads and we all shit ourselves.</v>

46
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>We were terrified.</v>

47
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>We look how with the fucking disappeared like right behind us on this little</v>

48
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>rise.</v>

49
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

50
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

51
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And we ran up there thinking it was going to be a plane crash and there is a</v>

52
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.961
<v Speaker 1>runway we didn't see because we've come down to the beach sideways and along the</v>

53
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:39.511
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>

54
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And there was an airport right there.</v>

55
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>But there was this moment where like we're tripping,</v>

56
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>the fish are eating us the dare boats going like this,</v>

57
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>which is making us paranoid.</v>

58
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And now here comes the plane for our heads and have done mushroom sentence and</v>

59
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why.</v>

60
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a bad place to do mushrooms.</v>

62
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 1>Set and setting is one of the most important thing as well where you were on a</v>

63
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>boat with a fucking dare boat going by and a plane flying and you're at a runway</v>

64
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>and we had no idea.</v>

65
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>We were standing at the foot of a runner.</v>

66
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you can smoke pot and do Jujitsu with no problem whatsoever.</v>

68
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.493
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

69
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.401
<v Speaker 1>Small pot.</v>

70
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And you're very coordinated.</v>

71
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Smoke Pot and something drops.</v>

72
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>You catch it.</v>

73
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Like your reflex is everything.</v>

74
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>They're all there and it lasts.</v>

75
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>You're not used to it if you're not used to it all you're thinking of.</v>

76
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I first started getting high,</v>

77
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>joey started making fun of me because we,</v>

78
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I forget what we did.</v>

79
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

80
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

81
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember we went to um,</v>

82
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Sunday brunch at a house of Blues.</v>

83
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Remember they had that Gospel Brunch and then that Gospel brunch chest,</v>

84
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>that's how we all went over there.</v>

85
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>We all went over there and we were toasted to the gills.</v>

86
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the first weekends I ever got high and Joey d is like,</v>

87
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking rookie and I was going,</v>

88
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe a high.</v>

89
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:47.301
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>right now this is ridiculous.</v>

91
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.523
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

92
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I have to sit here.</v>

93
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't used to it.</v>

94
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to deal with it,</v>

95
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but if I was the same high right now,</v>

96
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fine because I know what that is.</v>

97
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

98
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it's what you're doing is when you're too high and you're paranoid and you're</v>

99
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:03.754
<v Speaker 1>frozen,</v>

100
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>you're frozen because you don't know what it is.</v>

101
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what,</v>

102
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>what comes next because this is going to get worse.</v>

103
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get more crazy.</v>

104
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.133
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

105
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.061
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

106
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>how long is this going to last?</v>

107
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>But when you're used to being high,</v>

108
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just high dude.</v>

109
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.573
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

110
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

111
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is.</v>

112
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.180

117
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>But you were laughing at me.</v>

118

<v Speaker 2>Yet I just said it's.</v>

127
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 2>It's so you don't even breathe.</v>

129
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 2>A couple of weeks ago I had a cookie and I was sitting there as so fucking</v>

130
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 2>stoned at 8:00 at night and I kept thinking to myself,</v>

131
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.950
<v Speaker 2>this is the same cookie KCC case of eight.</v>

132
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It was the weekend.</v>

133
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 2>It was the week that he was busy that he went ms dot.</v>

134
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 2>He died or something.</v>

135
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I felt so bad.</v>

136
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on fucking Casey case,</v>

137
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but then there was traffic.</v>

138
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the news that day.</v>

139
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 2>There was traffic on the four,</v>

140
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:23.461

<v Speaker 2>The simple pleasures.</v>

162
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Even before,</v>

163
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 1>like I surprised myself that I became a world champion and kickboxing.</v>

164
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to fight to validate my coaching and I just kept winning fights</v>

165
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

166

168
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:22.460
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day I'm still the biggest fan.</v>

173
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>You want to look at more fights.</v>

174
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I can watch it till the cows come home with a man</v>

178
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:38.240

<v Speaker 1>The two oldest sports on the planet are wrestling?</v>

182
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.150

<v Speaker 1>They're the two most primal things you can do.</v>

188
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189

194
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>cicero quote on my arm,</v>

195
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the best protector of the sheep is the wolf.</v>

196
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe that some people in there wolves and some people are sheep.</v>

197
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people love fighting there.</v>

199
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.061
<v Speaker 1>The wolves,</v>

200
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>they're the protector,</v>

201
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and it's Kinda like training days,</v>

203
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>talking about it takes a wolf,</v>

204
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

205
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.781
<v Speaker 1>a wolf.</v>

206
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>But like fighting is dude,</v>

207
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's the most primal thing.</v>

208
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm still miss that.</v>

209
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>That dude wants to kick my ass.</v>

210
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I got to kick his ass.</v>

211
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

212
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the most nerve wracking.</v>

213
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.863
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

214
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

215
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>So I was a little experimental when I was a child and teenager after I lost my</v>

216
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.034
<v Speaker 1>sister,</v>

217
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw about 25 or 26 grateful dead concerts.</v>

218
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

219
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll use this analogy.</v>

220
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that I'm</v>

221
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting your first fight if you've never done it before,</v>

222
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like taking acid.</v>

223
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Either find yourself or lose yourself.</v>

224
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people are the baddest ass person on the planet,</v>

225
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>they're the best fighter in the gym and they go to the fight and they just melt</v>

226
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:05.511
<v Speaker 1>like butter.</v>

227
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>They're just can't,</v>

230
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231

233
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 1>and you're a God in front of 20 people and I'll do it in front of 20,000 people</v>

234
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>or in a local show,</v>

235
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>do it in front of 2100 people.</v>

236
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It still,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that vortex,</v>

238
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:30.030
<v Speaker 1>that rush of improving ground,</v>

239
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>true proven ground.</v>

240
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>An exposure of truth like nothing else because that's what I think it's like</v>

241
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many people lose themselves.</v>
