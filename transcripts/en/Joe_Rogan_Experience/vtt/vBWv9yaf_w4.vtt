WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin trying to shut this fucker.</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Shut that fucking thing off for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>We're here to celebrate the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Christie got kicked off of a quiet</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>train this morning for talking on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone while drinking a McDonald's </v>

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.831
<v Speaker 1>strawberry shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the guy who wants to band </v>

6
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>pot about band yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Slob.</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:27.141
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare he drink a McDonald's </v>

8
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>strawberry shake in public and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after having a stomach stapled.</v>

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

11
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just those bitches out.</v>

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do saying you think he's </v>

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just keep eating.</v>

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You just keep piling through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy was blown through two of </v>

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had it done twice and blown through</v>

17
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:51.441
<v Speaker 1>a both times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you actually like tear open the </v>

18
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:51.441
<v Speaker 1>staples like is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done any Mris operations on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>We are going to go heavy medical stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

21
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's been explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin,</v>

22
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>the skin is flexible and if you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep stretching that bitch out,</v>

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly when these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a friend and his friend,</v>

24
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>his friend of mine as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a good friend of his and he was </v>

25
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's about to go do this and I said,</v>

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>please try to talk them out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't need surgery.</v>

27
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He just needed to change your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the surgery is only going to fix</v>

28
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:26.871
<v Speaker 1>the physical aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason while you're stuffing </v>

29
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>all this sugar and fat and you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were addicted to food,</v>

30
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>so you need to find out what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

31
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>

32
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it's really at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is the physical thing.</v>

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I think the physical thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of a psychological issue </v>

34
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get physically addicted to shitty </v>

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I quit sugar recently.</v>

36
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't say quit sugar because I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little this weekend,</v>

37
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>so I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quit it,</v>

38
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I removed it from my primary diet and I </v>

39
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>quit it all together for two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to me five days in was </v>

40
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>really shocking because I had a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>headache like five days in.</v>

41
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>The cravings were freaky and my head was</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing me and it's like snapples and </v>

42
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>protein bars and low fat milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this shit that has sugar in </v>

43
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of granolas healthy and then I</v>

44
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>would look at him like 20 grams of sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a serving of grunt and I usually have</v>

45
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>two servings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look,</v>

46
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not even sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do,</v>

47
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:30.471
<v Speaker 1>we do in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do high fructose corn syrup to </v>

48
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>illuminate you on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in our coke and our can of coke,</v>

49
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>because it's cheaper to put corn in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sweeten it.</v>

50
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>We're drinking corn instead of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people get Mexican cokes.</v>

51
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a fancy restaurant here in la,</v>

52
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>they give you a Mexican coke because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has real sugar.</v>

53
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Think how just warped our whole system </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the core thing.</v>

54
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>We can do five hours on corn because </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn is,</v>

55
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>

56
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>it's in wallpaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an everything to mazing and you </v>

57
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get off sugar,</v>

58
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>but what you're really trying to get</v>

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>off his corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that as well.</v>

60
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

61
00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

62
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 2>even just simple sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like even like I read this one thing,</v>

63
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what the product was,</v>

64
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of the ingredients was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pure cane sugar.</v>

65
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you're selling me something </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

66
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Pepsi now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure cane sugar,</v>

67
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 2>like holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

68
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>it's still sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still.</v>

69
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Your body doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiate.</v>

70
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 2>It still shows us salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

72
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that's how dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how dumb people have become about</v>

73
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:35.641
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking a little bit about food </v>

74
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:35.641
<v Speaker 2>before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it's really,</v>

75
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most important stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you put into your body so that then</v>

76
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>you can function on this earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we are so warped.</v>

77
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 2>We got corn instead of sugar even just </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

78
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:50.321
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you I drank like 17 coffees </v>

79
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:50.321
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't put any.</v>

80
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>You have Stevia and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went straight,</v>

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

82
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I've been drinking straight black lately</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

83
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:01.291
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think this Guy Peter Giuliano on at one </v>

85
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 2>point who's a real coffee expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

86
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to a guy like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about putting cream into coffee,</v>

87
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 2>you could see his face like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing to him?</v>

88
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sacrilege almost.</v>

89
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>So what would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say to drink it?</v>

90
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just black.</v>

91
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been drinking a black.</v>

92
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I actually prefer it in a method that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Rob Wolf created,</v>

93
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 2>which is you mix it with grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 2>butter and mct oil.</v>

94
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.650
<v Speaker 2>The problem is for a podcast that gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>me phlegm and I stopped in the middle </v>

95
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 2>and it's annoying as fuck for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are listening,</v>

96
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>

97
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still do that,</v>

98
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't do it before podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

99
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 2>So I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for about six months.</v>

100
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I was doing the grass fed butter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil.</v>

101
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Just take a teaspoon of coconut oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing and you feel great and it's</v>

102
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.961
<v Speaker 2>delicious and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I did over the course of about six </v>

103
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:54.961
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably gained like eight pounds from</v>

104
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.370
<v Speaker 2>all the butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

105
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of calories to be plowing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

106
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>but he does do some good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has something to do with how </v>

107
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>the caffeine actually ingests into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

108
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>It slows it down so you don't get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>burst of energy crash and all that,</v>

109
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>which was all great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

110
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.660
<v Speaker 2>eight pounds in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a lot to gain.</v>

111
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

112
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>their appetite and your appetite.</v>

113
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

114
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give up.</v>

115
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I live in West Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

116
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of working out </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do and not,</v>

117
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>not Joe Rogan level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

118
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

119
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>just to stay in the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just certain them out.</v>

120
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been to Santa Monica in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of West Hollywood?</v>

121
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I live in the gay place on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen so many daisy dukes.</v>

122
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really bought well,</v>

123
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:41.491
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm considered morbidly obese by these </v>

124
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>people's standards because they starve </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

125
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand people listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin's a very slim and slender and</v>

126
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is,</v>

127
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay is placed on earth and these </v>

129
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.971
<v Speaker 2>guys work on their bodies all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should not be carrying</v>

130
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 3>a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They carry their dogs,</v>

131
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 3>these relapses and all this other man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your bicep shouldn't be bigger than your</v>

132
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

133
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.120
<v Speaker 3>That just shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be care.</v>

134
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I have a pimple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not,</v>

135
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my bicep snapped bigger than her.</v>

136
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a healthy way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

137
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 3>in West Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

138
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to.</v>

139
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 3>You Starve yourself and have huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>

140
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The steroids,</v>

141
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>

142
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.990
<v Speaker 1>that certainly helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

143
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.010
<v Speaker 1>There's some stuff that fighters had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been caught with that.</v>

144
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>

145
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.260
<v Speaker 1>There's one called clenbuterol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another called the nausea.</v>

146
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:32.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

147
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cleanse I think is supposed to like </v>

148
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 1>really just lean you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bodybuilder thing and this allows</v>

149
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:45.051
<v Speaker 1>you to keep mass on or helps you assist </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in keeping mass on when you cut </v>

150
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:50.001
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for fighters that are trying to be </v>

151
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:50.001
<v Speaker 1>like the biggest in their weight class </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

152
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:54.741
<v Speaker 1>dehydrating themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to keep as much muscle </v>

153
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:54.741
<v Speaker 1>mass as possible.</v>

154
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can't be good for long term health.</v>

155
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bad for your body.</v>

156
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see it with these guys and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

157
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing this just so that they can</v>

158
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:04.230
<v Speaker 3>get somebody that has a better body than</v>
<v Speaker 3>them so they can fuck.</v>

159
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.710
<v Speaker 3>And then they move on to the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this endless game.</v>

160
00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got a hot body,</v>

161
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:10.950
<v Speaker 3>he's got a high body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck him now.</v>

162
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I moved to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just this climbing this ladder.</v>

163
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Icarus,</v>

164
00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just going up and up and up.</v>

165
00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 3>But one day this thing is just going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>blow up in your face.</v>

166
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

167
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 3>that could be a second.</v>

168
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>If you look at life like life is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary trip,</v>

169
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:29.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have maybe 50 years of people </v>

170
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 1>actually wanting to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You if you're fucking so lucky you take </v>

171
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.911
<v Speaker 1>care of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like from 18 to like when </v>

172
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you're closing in on 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody fucks.</v>

173
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You was just doing new charity</v>

174
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and that's the saddest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the sadducees.</v>

175
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 3>These you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this,</v>

176
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:50.181
<v Speaker 3>these overly tanned hair plugged guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are 70 years old and they're still </v>

177
00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:55.701
<v Speaker 3>at the gym hoping that that 28 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>is looking at them and instead they're </v>

178
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.450
<v Speaker 3>staring at everyone and gawking at them </v>
<v Speaker 3>horribly.</v>

179
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 3>It's all grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really sad.</v>

180
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Or we can get into this a little later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also shows me why the gay </v>

181
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.630
<v Speaker 3>marriage thing was so important because </v>
<v Speaker 3>these are.</v>

182
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I actually have a lot empathy for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I can,</v>

183
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to make fun of,</v>

184
00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:15.231
<v Speaker 3>but like if you couldn't ever enter a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship that then you're going to </v>

185
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:17.250
<v Speaker 3>build like what you have with your wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can build a life,</v>

186
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can have kids and move forward </v>

187
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.501
<v Speaker 3>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then if all you have is just </v>

188
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:24.900
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just keep doing it.</v>

189
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>You not as many guys as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotations,</v>

190
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>different ones texting you all day long </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to put it together.</v>

191
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

192
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but figure out when you get squeezed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

193
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it.</v>

194
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess you know,</v>

195
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.740
<v Speaker 3>it feels good in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the longterm health of just like</v>

196
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 3>what being human is</v>

197
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Speaker 1>not so great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you know,</v>

198
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

199
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the perspective of like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full long life,</v>

200
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.580
<v Speaker 1>like it's just a bunch of moments just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like trying to maintain happiness and</v>

201
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:59.581
<v Speaker 1>a certain level as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could be Chris Christie where </v>

202
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you're addicted to Mcdonald's shakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a fat slob.</v>

203
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 1>The sausage sandwiches now can advise </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much ego.</v>

204
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:10.761
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't listen or you could try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill yourself up with that and you know,</v>

205
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>be married and have kids and have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your life achieve normalcy.</v>

206
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Or You can do the Super Tan roided up </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Suck and rampage that,</v>

207
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>those guys that workout at like Gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gold's gym on Cole.</v>

208
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's by.</v>

209
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

210
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.390
<v Speaker 1>when I was on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to work out,</v>

211
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to work at sunset and gower that</v>

212
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>was the studio and Gold's gym was right </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street.</v>

213
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes we'd have off like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours during the middle of the day where</v>

214
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they had to rewrite scripts or stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

215
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just shoot over to goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a workout and then come back.</v>

216
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>But it is the fucking gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim.</v>

217
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

218
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a ferocious disco is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of men with scrunchy </v>

219
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:59.011
<v Speaker 1>socks on timberlands and like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>short shorts and just to tightest tank </v>

220
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:04.911
<v Speaker 1>tops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you walk in there like a wounded </v>

221
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>antelope just gingerly stepping close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waterhole.</v>

222
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>But how did you feel there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're,</v>

223
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you're in good shape but you're in good </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

224
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you care about your body,</v>

225
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing the right things,</v>

226
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but you go in there and you see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and you,</v>

227
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you does it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

228
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a fat fuck.</v>

229
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that at all.</v>

230
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my twenties when I was doing </v>

231
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one,</v>

232
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I was on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was.</v>

233
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking being targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the problem.</v>

234
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Like guys felt like you could have 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds on the bar.</v>

235
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Guys like I'll spot you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need to spot dude.</v>

236
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Get your fucking balls from above my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

237
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Like they would literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be on the bench and dudes would </v>

238
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.750
<v Speaker 1>just put their dick above your head to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the bar.</v>

239
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted their Dick in proximity</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your face.</v>

240
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>You know like when you're doing bench </v>
<v Speaker 1>presses,</v>

241
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.900
<v Speaker 1>they can literally bench press with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their Cox.</v>

242
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 1>This was pre Viagra to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think because this was in the</v>

243
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these poor bastards were going on in the</v>

244
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:02.121
<v Speaker 1>match and when it went bad then the coc </v>
<v Speaker 1>pumps and w was the liberace movie with </v>

245
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas behind the candelabra.</v>

246
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>

247
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.840
<v Speaker 1>They used to have implants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess back in those days.</v>

248
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:14.841
<v Speaker 1>Those poor guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea we were going to start </v>

249
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:14.841
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of this show.</v>

250
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Let that bitch run for us a brief </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

251
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not entirely because I can defend </v>

252
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.951
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt what it was like to be a </v>

253
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>woman that was pursued by men because </v>
<v Speaker 1>men are fucking gross.</v>

254
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing.</v>

255
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with gay or </v>

256
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a man thing.</v>

257
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you happen to be a man into men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

258
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Well congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got welcome to that world and </v>

259
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 1>were treated like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have great sympathy for women that </v>

260
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got treated like a woman with a gun,</v>

261
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

263
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.530
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

264
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I wasn't vulnerable physically </v>

265
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 1>because I was like stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And then it's two dudes looking at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and I'm like,</v>

267
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

268
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a woman who could </v>

269
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>physically be overpowered by this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a guy saying,</v>

270
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kick your ass if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop trying to fuck me.</v>

271
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Like stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you always amazed at their </v>

272
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.701
<v Speaker 1>relentless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relentless tenacity to never take a acu </v>

273
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan into it and they can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the cue,</v>

274
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

275
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Well it's only a few guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most guys would figure out that you were</v>

276
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>straight and they were respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority,</v>

277
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but it only takes if there's 300 guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out at the gym,</v>

278
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 1>it only takes two guys to fuck up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire experience.</v>

279
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Less than one percent and they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

280
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>But those are the ones that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

281
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>

282
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably 50 other guys they're </v>

283
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:43.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to work their way into the friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>

284
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>which is what women experience would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women experiences a bunch of guys.</v>

285
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was younger and I was </v>

286
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.671
<v Speaker 1>single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking girls that I dated who </v>

287
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 1>would work with some guy who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

288
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Mike from the office says this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a much trying to fuck you.</v>

289
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not even a real person.</v>

290
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.250
<v Speaker 1>He's not even a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike's wearing a Kabuki mask and he's </v>

291
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.250
<v Speaker 1>doing a fucking dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mating dance.</v>

292
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not what he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

293
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

294
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to the gym and deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mike,</v>

295
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:16.070
<v Speaker 1>because Mike is Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I mean.</v>

296
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a reason why there's 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion of us because this,</v>

297
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>this drive to procreate and not even on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a conscious level.</v>

298
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

299
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I have to get this girl pregnant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a baby.</v>

300
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got to come inside her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I have to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to figure out how to get this </v>

302
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 1>person touched my body and create </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>

303
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't take the,</v>

304
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective steps to recognize,</v>

305
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a gigantic biological trick </v>

306
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.331
<v Speaker 1>that's been set in place by nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was really hard to survive </v>

307
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:49.560
<v Speaker 1>just a few thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was insanely hard to survive and you </v>

308
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.071
<v Speaker 1>had to make sure you meet as many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible so that they made as many </v>

309
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 1>people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can keep this retarded party going</v>

310
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:58.741
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is that the end of the </v>

311
00:13:58.741 --> 00:13:58.741
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

312
00:13:58.741 --> 00:13:59.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it keeps getting dumber.</v>

313
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen idiocracy you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

314
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I honestly haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen clips of it,</v>

315
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but I had a bit that people accused me </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stealing from idiocracy.</v>

316
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>But luckily I did the bit before </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiocracy came out.</v>

317
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>So I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got grandfathered in.</v>

318
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the comedians dilemma when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing good shit.</v>

319
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>So that 10 years later everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

320
00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you must have stole that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

321
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

322
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that 10 years ago.</v>

323
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that close.</v>

324
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>It was just the concept that many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had is a dumb people or outbreeding</v>

325
00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:29.240
<v Speaker 1>smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's the,</v>

326
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the movie mine was that explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pyramids.</v>

327
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.760
<v Speaker 1>My thing was that the idiot pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers would show up one day and go,</v>

328
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:40.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to get my chuck on </v>

329
00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is everybody?</v>

330
00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:44.250
<v Speaker 1>But all the smart people figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build the pyramids had already died </v>

331
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people just moved into the </v>

332
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.360
<v Speaker 1>pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why we live in these mud houses,</v>

333
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.600
<v Speaker 1>we can live in the periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they moved into the pyramids and </v>

334
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>pretending they built it and it's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>long thing that sort of explains</v>

335
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 2>what's going on today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we all think at a </v>

336
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:02.291
<v Speaker 2>certain level that that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's way more dumb people in </v>

337
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:05.531
<v Speaker 2>there are smart people and then we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that we benefit from people like </v>

338
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Elan Musk and innovators and geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how many of them are there?</v>

339
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>

340
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiny,</v>

341
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 2>tiny number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

343
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got gay married like a month ago.</v>

344
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I love what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage.</v>

345
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first off,</v>

346
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 2>people don't believe that I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just simply don't accept.</v>

347
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they accept it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't say I don't act gay.</v>

348
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I play sports and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this at the gap,</v>

350
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.790
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not getting,</v>

351
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 2>like ever comprehend Fitch and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>assaulted with that smell that they zap </v>

352
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you with when you walk in there.</v>

353
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

354
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I know that smell a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be afraid when I was closeted,</v>

355
00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>like in high school and college because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't come out until really my mid to</v>

356
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:47.021
<v Speaker 2>late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I used to be afraid of Abercrombie </v>

357
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:47.021
<v Speaker 2>and Fitch because they used to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those shirtless,</v>

358
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these shirtless hot guys standing </v>

359
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>outside and I felt that they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would know,</v>

360
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.640
<v Speaker 2>like I just thought like these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to know that I'm standing outside </v>

361
00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.440
<v Speaker 2>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

362
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh you don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even the stores at the mall,</v>

363
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.420
<v Speaker 2>they'd have just these shirtless guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

364
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are all perfectly Tan.</v>

365
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 2>They all look perfect and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be standing there greeting you.</v>

366
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.200
<v Speaker 2>And to me it was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

367
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220
<v Speaker 2>it was like walking into a porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was afraid that they were going to </v>

368
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.220
<v Speaker 2>like read gay on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never,</v>

369
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:20.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever bought anything </v>

370
00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 2>from Abercrombie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there many times,</v>

371
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.270
<v Speaker 2>but I'd never seen never.</v>

372
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 2>What year was it that they did this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were for a long time.</v>

373
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 2>They were doing this probably in the mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>to early two thousands.</v>

374
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

375
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I probably didn't go to Abercrombie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitch until the mid two thousands.</v>

376
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they were phasing it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:42.551
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That started as a hunting and fishing </v>

378
00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:42.551
<v Speaker 2>supply company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

379
00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 2>like void.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking make a turn.</v>

380
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And then that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 2>the guy who runs it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's got,</v>

382
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 2>he must have body dysmorphia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this guy up Jamie.</v>

383
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>He's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his name is.</v>

384
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.880
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.980
<v Speaker 2>he really instilled this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone there has to look perfect and </v>

386
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.671
<v Speaker 2>look the same sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they've had all these </v>

387
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:03.671
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits with people that are either a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little fat.</v>

388
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:08.621
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't get jobs there or I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a girl who wanted to wear a </v>

389
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:08.621
<v Speaker 2>hijab or all that stuff.</v>

390
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at this guy will pull </v>

391
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.851
<v Speaker 2>them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got so much fucking work done on his </v>

392
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:15.851
<v Speaker 2>face because he's just close to what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>said before.</v>

393
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:20.561
<v Speaker 2>He's like expressing his own weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's projecting them onto a </v>

394
00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:25.331
<v Speaker 2>generation of kids and he's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing his own confusion externally.</v>

395
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Whether you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

396
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 2>look at that guy like he's had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious shit.</v>

397
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:34.631
<v Speaker 2>Sixty one year old CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to say his name says dude </v>

398
00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:34.631
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll say,</v>

399
00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is salon.com.</v>

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

401
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Frauds just aggressively shitty and I </v>

403
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.440
<v Speaker 2>don't fight those fucking headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those tweets I had done following </v>

404
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.620
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is such epic Shit and just such </v>

405
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.751
<v Speaker 2>dishonest trash like a Dave Rubin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he's everything that's wrong with </v>

406
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taglia.</v>

407
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would get those kinds of articles </v>

408
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.301
<v Speaker 2>and just twisting and distorting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>real positions to make social brownie </v>

409
00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 2>points to appeal to the hardest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore,</v>

410
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>aggressive social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 2>lefties.</v>

411
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Can we get everybody to hate everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking split everybody down to just </v>

412
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:22.371
<v Speaker 2>their color and their sex to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can then control everybody </v>

413
00:18:22.371 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 2>because if anyone gets out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>little box,</v>

414
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.820
<v Speaker 2>there is something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Something wrong with you.</v>

415
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this poor guy,</v>

416
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 2>he's not hanging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

417
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 2>like Robert Redford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker's going in there.</v>

418
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

419
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 2>he's hanging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

420
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously an old dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't look like a monster.</v>

421
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was at,</v>

422
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:41.511
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid has a gymnastics class and </v>

423
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:44.631
<v Speaker 2>there's this poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate woman who goes to this </v>

424
00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:44.631
<v Speaker 2>gymnastic class who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 2>she looks like she's quite wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's always dressed very well,</v>

426
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 2>but she's gotten what I call monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and monster faces when they shoot </v>

427
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.451
<v Speaker 2>their face up with filler and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the lips and then they pull their </v>

428
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:56.451
<v Speaker 2>face back.</v>

429
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 2>So they have this sort of reptilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

430
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Mouth is way too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way too big.</v>

431
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Pull on this fucking skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the opening of their mouth doesn't </v>

432
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 2>match a normal person's face because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bigger.</v>

433
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 2>It stretches like this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Christie stomach pulling it,</v>

434
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it gets bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being skin is flexible.</v>

435
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Think how deranged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really like the idea of that.</v>

436
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people care about what they look </v>

437
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

438
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.120
<v Speaker 2>So they want to look better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go in that first time,</v>

439
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 2>they get a little botox or they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling or one of those filters,</v>

440
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think how the course of that changes</v>

441
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:36.141
<v Speaker 2>the way they think about everything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where that woman probably </v>

442
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>thinks she looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

443
00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an adventure in the psyche,</v>

444
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

445
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as bodybuilders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as people with Anorexia.</v>

446
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as the guys we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before.</v>

447
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

448
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 2>you just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you do,</v>

449
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 2>you take off your shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look in the mirror and you go,</v>

450
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 2>this should be a little tighter over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

451
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the woman's looking at her,</v>

452
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 2>it's always the upper lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the women.</v>

453
00:19:57.391 --> 00:20:02.391
<v Speaker 2>They get fat for this poor lady that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that had her lips done and every </v>

454
00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:07.731
<v Speaker 2>time she talks to you that she's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scar like inside of her mouth that's </v>

455
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's her lip,</v>

456
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it.</v>

457
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the lips never moved correctly.</v>

458
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Like Lisa Rena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that her name?</v>

459
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.060
<v Speaker 2>She had that thing removed right as she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

460
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.740
<v Speaker 2>she was the one that had like the crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

461
00:20:22.741 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 2>crazy lips and I'm pretty sure about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year ago,</v>

462
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had something taken out or some </v>

463
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>filler or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I get it though,</v>

464
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:36.621
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had hair transplants when I was in my </v>

465
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:36.621
<v Speaker 2>twenties and didn't take trig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely didn't take.</v>

466
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a joke about it.</v>

467
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:43.581
<v Speaker 2>The joke was it's like taking really </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy people and moving them into a </v>

468
00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood where everybody's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we try to repopulate.</v>

469
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Chernobyl,</v>

470
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you thought you were gentrifying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

471
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but in the end you just killed more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

472
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>

473
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep losing hair.</v>

474
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>So worked at first like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

475
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:58.790
<v Speaker 1>the parts that it was falling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I filled in.</v>

476
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 1>We're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not good.</v>

477
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps,</v>

478
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.570
<v Speaker 1>keeps [inaudible] up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did the thing where you actually </v>

479
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 1>cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

480
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut a strip out.</v>

481
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>How long did you let it go before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave up and just said,</v>

482
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.820
<v Speaker 1>well I had it done and then it's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just slowly giving up and then </v>

483
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.750
<v Speaker 1>there's also things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could take Rogaine,</v>

484
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:24.751
<v Speaker 1>which kind of keeps it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how funny is it when your name is </v>

485
00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and you go into buy Rogaine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

486
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for that reason.</v>

487
00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Well you probably shouldn't have been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it was just dealt with it,</v>

488
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Speaker 1>dealt with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like if it works I don't give a </v>

489
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

490
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And it did kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Propecia,</v>

491
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.220
<v Speaker 1>which works really well but also kills </v>
<v Speaker 1>your tick.</v>

492
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got,</v>

493
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of options.</v>

494
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on probation for about six months,</v>

495
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>about maybe seven or eight years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get a boner.</v>

496
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a boner killer rather than like,</v>

497
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I can fully say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that I shaved my head,</v>

498
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I actually like it way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy and you don't get kidnapped</v>

499
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.760
<v Speaker 1>by people that are cutting your hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

500
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get my hair cut by this lady who I love </v>

501
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 1>dearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I'd be in a rush.</v>

502
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>She would hold me hostage with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stories because she'd be holding</v>

503
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:14.671
<v Speaker 1>the scissors and then I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to fucking talk to me </v>

504
00:22:14.671 --> 00:22:14.671
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

505
00:22:14.671 --> 00:22:15.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really interesting.</v>

506
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Cut My fucking hair so I can run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut my hair so I can run away.</v>

507
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 1>So basically you shaved your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't want to listen to </v>

508
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 1>this bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

509
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 1>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not big.</v>

510
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>She's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>

511
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 1>But your stories are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even that.</v>

512
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something to not think about.</v>

513
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden when I shaved </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

514
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it was like instant freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

515
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I use the back of my head as a </v>

516
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>public service announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if anybody's thinking about getting</v>

517
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.280
<v Speaker 1>a hair transplant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

518
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 1>look at my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see the scar.</v>

519
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't want one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not the worst thing in the </v>

520
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:44.970
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get this straight.</v>

521
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.691
<v Speaker 1>Can you swim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I always see in the commercials </v>

522
00:22:48.691 --> 00:22:48.691
<v Speaker 1>when they get the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they can swim again.</v>

523
00:22:48.691 --> 00:22:53.460
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they couldn't swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had lost the ability to do the </v>

524
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 1>breast stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wig commercials are the same.</v>

525
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:59.251
<v Speaker 1>And the commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always underwater just like </v>

526
00:22:59.251 --> 00:22:59.251
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're telling me you can still swim.</v>

527
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little sleeker through the water,</v>

528
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but timing is off.</v>

529
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense because the,</v>

530
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you see the Olympic guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were the cap.</v>

531
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:13.250
<v Speaker 1>So then it makes it seem like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>bald and they're swimming well and yeah,</v>

532
00:23:13.251 --> 00:23:18.251
<v Speaker 1>you watch those commercials and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a head of hair and they're </v>

533
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:18.251
<v Speaker 1>swimming well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very confusing.</v>

534
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is that if you get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

535
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>like instantly all the work that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done with hairspray to lock this fucking</v>

536
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 1>monster and place it all evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolves with the water and you'll </v>

537
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>leave behind an oil slick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

538
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:31.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

539
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:36.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get in the water with one of </v>

540
00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:36.991
<v Speaker 1>those wacky wigs hair club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jammies,</v>

541
00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:39.370
<v Speaker 1>when the idea is that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can tell,</v>

542
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 1>nobody can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know you have theories on things.</v>

543
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a theory on hair loss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it stress related for you?</v>

544
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

545
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 2>purely a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genetics is dihydrotestosterone.</v>

546
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Your body produces a derivative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

547
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 2>DHT causes your hair to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it exists in humans.</v>

548
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange thing and why it exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some and not others,</v>

549
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like really close to fixing that</v>

550
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 2>apparently with just like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill or a rub,</v>

551
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but that'll probably cause cancer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind in one eye.</v>

552
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 2>You have diarrhea and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every pill we take causes 20 other </v>

553
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.080
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that they need to start.</v>

555
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 2>They need to show us when they talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the pill,</v>

556
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:22.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever pill it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got restless leg syndrome,</v>

557
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you got what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your legs can't stop because that real </v>

558
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 2>build art is a funny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I that like,</v>

559
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we sit all day.</v>

560
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 2>It's your body like revolting against </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

561
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 2>like get the fuck up.</v>

562
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like joggers get restless </v>
<v Speaker 2>leg syndrome,</v>

563
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.300
<v Speaker 2>not because they're actually moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

564
00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to study with.</v>

565
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a runner.</v>

566
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get restless legs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

567
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You got the late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole life.</v>

568
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.880
<v Speaker 2>You get restless leg but you've run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

569
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.410
<v Speaker 2>While I was moving my legs over here </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like they need to move.</v>

570
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

571
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

572
00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think they should have to show like </v>

573
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 2>when they show you the pill and they and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everyone's running in a field.</v>

574
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It's all that bullshit marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>

575
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.200
<v Speaker 2>but then they'll say I could cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal thought they should've show </v>

576
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 2>someone going through suicidal thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>or show somebody having diarrhea.</v>

577
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Like they keep doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the guys running through a field </v>

578
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.011
<v Speaker 2>having a helped show me what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dos commercial death show a guy walking </v>

579
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 2>down the boardwalk just dropping dead.</v>

580
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why are they allowed to do that?</v>

581
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It's such mixed messaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand what you're getting</v>

582
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 2>yourself into chantix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to stop smoking.</v>

583
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 2>You might drop dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>

584
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive diarrhea,</v>

585
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like show me.</v>

586
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing if you're advertising a</v>

587
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

588
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got like the newest Cadillac and </v>

589
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.870
<v Speaker 2>it looks cool and you drive and you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

590
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Driving like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

591
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to get one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of okay,</v>

592
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but if it's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's some crazy you meant,</v>

593
00:25:46.201 --> 00:25:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you remember there was a drug that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were selling for a while.</v>

594
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 2>They were advertising that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement to your current </v>

595
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

596
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.230
<v Speaker 2>that was like an bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fly or something like that.</v>

597
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Was that the one with the cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cartoon cloud that was following the</v>

598
00:25:59.121 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

599
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was because if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon in cloud,</v>

600
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>you've got some serious problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something fucked up about </v>

601
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.260
<v Speaker 2>advertising for something that's a drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can affect your mind and possibly </v>

602
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:16.691
<v Speaker 2>cause suicidal thoughts because </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising is entirely designed to coax</v>

603
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>you into buying the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

604
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big life to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask Your doctor about it and that you </v>

605
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.611
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be allowed to say it </v>

606
00:26:27.611 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 2>because then every first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's on prescription drugs.</v>

607
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on any prescription drugs right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

608
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:35.051
<v Speaker 2>I have been for about six months also </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the time I was on Lexapro or one </v>

609
00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:39.100
<v Speaker 2>of those mild kills your Dick to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a double whammy.</v>

610
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>It was getting kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punched.</v>

611
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back.</v>

612
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 2>He's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And better than ever.</v>

613
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

614
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was on one of those and when I,</v>

615
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.910
<v Speaker 3>when I got off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're supposed to tell your </v>

616
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist or whatever because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>ween you off it.</v>

617
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the guy and I was like,</v>

618
00:26:56.131 --> 00:27:01.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to get off this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't like the psychiatrists are </v>

619
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:01.131
<v Speaker 3>keeping shit from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like.</v>

620
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:05.500
<v Speaker 3>His last name was Ruben,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I went to him and then I </v>

621
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:05.500
<v Speaker 3>just didn't like them and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

622
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

623
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just figured,</v>

624
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:07.650
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take,</v>

625
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:12.651
<v Speaker 3>instead of taking one a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just do one every other day and </v>

626
00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:12.651
<v Speaker 3>then one every three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

627
00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 3>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I weaned off if I kid you not,</v>

628
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when you used to turn on an </v>

629
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 3>old computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an old desktop computer,</v>

630
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:25.190
<v Speaker 3>all the worrying and the buzzing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear the hard drive spinning and </v>

631
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.190
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

632
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I could feel that in my brain for about </v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks when I got off it.</v>

633
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt my brain actually resetting or </v>

634
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 3>something like literally a worrying </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like.</v>

635
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.640
<v Speaker 3>And then like little sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was this when you were thinking or </v>

636
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 3>anytime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remember I lived in New York City</v>

637
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:45.231
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember very vividly one day I was </v>

638
00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:46.911
<v Speaker 3>walking down in Amsterdam and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a week out and I felt my brain </v>

639
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 3>like just coming back on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that shit,</v>

640
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 3>it does something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does something and forget.</v>

641
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 3>And the boner stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

642
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:59.421
<v Speaker 3>all that I had of the reason I got off </v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually was because one of my best </v>

643
00:27:59.421 --> 00:28:02.871
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood best friends was killed in a </v>

644
00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:02.871
<v Speaker 3>car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

645
00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:07.820
<v Speaker 3>when I heard I had almost no reaction is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends from four years </v>

646
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 3>old and I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sad,</v>

647
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 3>but like I didn't have a sad reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

648
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 3>like I knew it was sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my reaction was and said,</v>

649
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 3>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

650
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

651
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:24.410
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrifying thing to remove the </v>

652
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:24.410
<v Speaker 4>lows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

653
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 4>All the lows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lows are there to teach you.</v>

654
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

655
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:30.450
<v Speaker 4>you gotta learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta learn from failure.</v>

656
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Failure is important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an and,</v>

657
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feeling bad is important.</v>

658
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is because it makes,</v>

659
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:42.050
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you understand and appreciate the </v>

660
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.050
<v Speaker 4>magnitude of feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

661
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.150
<v Speaker 4>It draws you towards that as a better </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative.</v>

662
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

663
00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 3>And especially as an artist that someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that speaks and is supposed to have a </v>

664
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.770
<v Speaker 3>full set of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be able to go on stage,</v>

665
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.270
<v Speaker 3>tell people what I think,</v>

666
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the argument with school </v>

667
00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.741
<v Speaker 4>shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about school shooters </v>

668
00:28:59.741 --> 00:29:00.050
<v Speaker 4>is a massively disproportionate amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them are on.</v>

669
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.730
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that they can do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

670
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.340
<v Speaker 4>the what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for what,</v>

671
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what came first,</v>

672
00:29:07.521 --> 00:29:12.521
<v Speaker 4>is it the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mental illness that causes them to </v>

673
00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:12.680
<v Speaker 4>be able to shoot somebody in the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>place?</v>

674
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Or is it the fact that they're on pills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it the fact that they're on pills </v>

675
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 4>because they're mentally ill?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows?</v>

676
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.550
<v Speaker 4>But people that I know that have been on</v>
<v Speaker 4>various antidepressants,</v>

677
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:29.801
<v Speaker 4>Ssri is whatever they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tell you that things don't bother </v>

678
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:29.801
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

679
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 4>So if things don't bond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shooting people,</v>

680
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:36.100
<v Speaker 4>like the lack of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it seems to me in my armchair </v>

681
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.100
<v Speaker 4>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

682
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.410
<v Speaker 4>position that that would just be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>correlation there.</v>

683
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

684
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>it's always why we have a real</v>

685
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 2>inability in America to talk about two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things at once.</v>

686
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 2>That two things can be true at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

687
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 2>So like when you look at the shootings </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

688
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:54.781
<v Speaker 2>the people who are against guns will say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about guns and the people who are </v>

689
00:29:54.781 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 2>for guns will say it's about mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

690
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure two things can be true at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

691
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:04.651
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a mental health problem and we </v>

692
00:30:04.651 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 2>have to easy access to guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hunter.</v>

693
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure your second amendment </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

694
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

695
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the second amendment we </v>

696
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 2>should be able to arm ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is still too easy to get guns.</v>

697
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:19.111
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be able to necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a assault rifle to plow down 30 </v>

698
00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:19.450
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all that.</v>

699
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

700
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge percentage of these people are on</v>

701
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 2>some sort of medication.</v>

702
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all men,</v>

703
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't have something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

704
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.260
<v Speaker 2>no matter how many guns you had access </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>

705
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

706
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

707
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 2>relatively same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how many guns you have,</v>

708
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.920
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to shoot a school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

709
00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that says,</v>

710
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:44.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some mental health component to </v>

711
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.070
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

712
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be really difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a car to.</v>

713
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it should be get </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get a gun.</v>

714
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:51.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so as they should do some sort of </v>

715
00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:51.181
<v Speaker 2>background check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>

716
00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 2>They should evaluate whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any competency whatsoever.</v>

717
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much have you learned about shooting</v>

718
00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the case right now.</v>

719
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other problem is there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many guns out there that the people that</v>

720
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:02.980
<v Speaker 2>are doing this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this last guy in Oregon,</v>

721
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I think he didn't get the gun.</v>

722
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.800
<v Speaker 2>It was his mom that got the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

723
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I can get a gun even if even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be able to get a gun that is </v>

724
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 2>an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should make it more difficult.</v>

725
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>And the mental health aspect of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge problem.</v>

726
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.590
<v Speaker 2>And to say that it's not that it's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun issue is,</v>

727
00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:23.070
<v Speaker 2>is a blind thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

728
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

729
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different issues at </v>
<v Speaker 2>stake here and I think that's the case </v>

730
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.181
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of different things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the problems that I have </v>

731
00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:33.181
<v Speaker 2>with like the idea of a left and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

732
00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a lot of left ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them,</v>

733
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll have a few right ideas I </v>

734
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.561
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on sort of both sides of a lot of </v>

735
00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:43.561
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

736
00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I definitely want to get into that </v>

737
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.260
<v Speaker 2>with you because that's become like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my home now.</v>

738
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 2>This is really the split on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what I'm calling the regressives</v>

739
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.700
<v Speaker 2>and people that I think really stand for</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal principles.</v>

740
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 2>That's all on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

741
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I have some good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot.</v>

742
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians in general I think have hugely</v>

743
00:31:58.901 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 2>strong libertarian leanings because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be.</v>

744
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:07.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have very little to do with our </v>

745
00:32:07.171 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure I don't get shot,</v>

746
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:09.850
<v Speaker 2>which they're not that great at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

747
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of the economy,</v>

748
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.680
<v Speaker 2>keep us safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that pretty much is what I think </v>

749
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.680
<v Speaker 2>the government's role should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

750
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 2>That's about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 2>make sure we have a good education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

752
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:20.620
<v Speaker 2>The road should be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like pretty limited stuff.</v>

753
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think usually for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians do fall on that scale.</v>

754
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock is there a bill Maher,</v>

755
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.180
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a zillion comedians on that side of it.</v>

756
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen a massive split in the </v>

757
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.881
<v Speaker 2>left right now and this goes to all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior shit and </v>

758
00:32:35.881 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 2>everyone's a racist and a homophobe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking exhausting.</v>

759
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

760
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had Sam Harris on a bunch of </v>

761
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.931
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what these people have done to Sam </v>

762
00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:46.931
<v Speaker 1>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

763
00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 1>They're just using him as a target or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I believe.</v>

764
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I believe that instead of looking at his</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual positions and being objective and</v>

765
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he have a point?</v>

766
00:32:57.831 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 1>What is his point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's debate the point.</v>

767
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's debate the merits of the point.</v>

768
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that you can point to and say</v>

769
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 1>he will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a strong position about Islam,</v>

770
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:13.510
<v Speaker 1>so he is Islamophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is there for racist and he should be </v>

771
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.321
<v Speaker 1>attacked and fuck that piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I've seen the same written </v>

772
00:33:17.321 --> 00:33:17.710
<v Speaker 1>about Christopher hitchens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

773
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I saw some people when he died that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>running good written,</v>

774
00:33:20.681 --> 00:33:25.681
<v Speaker 1>so I made fun of this one social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>war because he was saying good riddance </v>

775
00:33:25.681 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 1>to Hitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when Osama bin Ladin died,</v>

776
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.781
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to celebrate the death of </v>

777
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:31.781
<v Speaker 1>any human being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

778
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:31.781
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking hilarious.</v>

779
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:31.781
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

780
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking.</v>

781
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing things.</v>

782
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:40.121
<v Speaker 1>And this is part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and I think one of the </v>

783
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:43.451
<v Speaker 1>things that we're finding with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole social social justice warrior </v>

784
00:33:43.451 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>issue is that it's not necessarily just </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

785
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's opinions that are being expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way where they know people are </v>

786
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.531
<v Speaker 1>going to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know people are going to see their </v>

787
00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:58.391
<v Speaker 1>writing and so that that knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to see what you're </v>

788
00:33:58.391 --> 00:34:01.610
<v Speaker 1>writing and react to it either positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>or negative effects your choices.</v>

789
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like reality TV and what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is like when you see people act </v>

790
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 1>fake on reality TV because you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know the cameras are on them.</v>

791
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing when you make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded social justice warrior tweet,</v>

792
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you're a hundred percent right.</v>

793
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So I know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get their name,</v>

794
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 1>who right now is pretty big in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality space on a reality show right </v>

795
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.090
<v Speaker 1>this second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

796
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:27.120
<v Speaker 1>the very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says to me all the time like </v>

797
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All he's doing is ramping up to stay on </v>

798
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 1>the show to keep the whole thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

799
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these people are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Sam,</v>

800
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:35.180
<v Speaker 1>how many times has he been here at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

801
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horror,</v>

802
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.490
<v Speaker 1>four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four or five times.</v>

803
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So you've sat with this guy for hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hours with this guy.</v>

804
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's racist in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

805
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he is,</v>

806
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 1>he's fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

807
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying he doesn't have fear </v>

808
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 1>of normal consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>

810
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just that if he has a principal who</v>
<v Speaker 1>express it and I've,</v>

811
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I've disagreed with them about certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

812
00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

813
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.540
<v Speaker 1>his principles and his opinions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will truly express,</v>

814
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.660
<v Speaker 1>express them.</v>

815
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And in unpopular subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're talking about Islam or </v>

816
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about religion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

817
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes a tremendous amount of heat </v>

818
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:17.860
<v Speaker 1>about that and he only gets it for Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

819
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the truth of it.</v>

820
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a guy who wrote a letter to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Christian nation.</v>

821
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Guess what it was about Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody called him a Christian.</v>

822
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 1>A phobe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

823
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So when Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that night then the whole thing all </v>

824
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.290
<v Speaker 1>hell broke loose with athletic on unreal</v>
<v Speaker 1>time or heaven.</v>

825
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Heaven broke loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

826
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

827
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some imaginary bullshit.</v>

828
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that night.</v>

829
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.420
<v Speaker 3>And I know we both talked about this at </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

830
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.820
<v Speaker 3>but what happened was athletic </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately went to the social justice </v>

831
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.170
<v Speaker 3>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm holier than thou,</v>

832
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to portray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect the downtrodden thing,</v>

833
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.260
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was nonsense and bullshit.</v>

834
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Sam Sat there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

835
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 3>you can disagree with the premise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he says.</v>

836
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 3>You can disagree with his feelings on </v>
<v Speaker 3>profiling or nuclear first strike,</v>

837
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:08.390
<v Speaker 3>but he'll debate all of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat with him for an hour and a half </v>

838
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 3>and he would have done three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our crew guys had to leave.</v>

839
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:13.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy who will stake out these </v>

840
00:36:13.551 --> 00:36:16.281
<v Speaker 3>positions and unpopular positions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them out there and they just want to</v>

841
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:21.741
<v Speaker 3>shout him down and what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the real thing though is it's the </v>

842
00:36:21.741 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 3>chilling effect on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what?</v>

843
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not about shutting down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam.</v>

844
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:28.221
<v Speaker 3>If Sam disappears tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be really bad for our </v>

845
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 3>discourse as a country and I think this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a guy saying important shit,</v>

846
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come for Joe Rogan.</v>

847
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:37.310
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come for Dave Rubin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to come for all the other </v>

848
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.310
<v Speaker 3>people that are tweeting about</v>

849
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.180
<v Speaker 1>and what they're really doing is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to take the moral high ground.</v>

850
00:36:40.181 --> 00:36:42.370
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to teach you some more </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit of being like.</v>

851
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.270
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

852
00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.350
<v Speaker 1>if Ben Affleck had a real nuanced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective position,</v>

853
00:36:47.351 --> 00:36:48.880
<v Speaker 1>he certainly didn't express it on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

854
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You mean racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

855
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a fucking idiot.</v>

856
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.200
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I can go see that </v>

857
00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Batman movie because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

858
00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.210
<v Speaker 3>he has turned me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love superhero movies.</v>

859
00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that.</v>

860
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:00.400
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

861
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 1>fact that he was willing to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position on a show like that and argue </v>

862
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 1>with that without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>

863
00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

864
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I like Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a very funny comic that </v>

865
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:12.160
<v Speaker 1>show socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

866
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 1>This is why I like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like socks.</v>

867
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It's doesn't suck because it's a sucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

868
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It sucks because all these subjects are </v>
<v Speaker 1>massively important and have a bunch of </v>

869
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.390
<v Speaker 1>people shouting over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>

870
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>like you and I have very strong opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we want to express ourselves and </v>

871
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>there's only two of us luckily because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

872
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.580
<v Speaker 1>if there was five of us in the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and we're all talking,</v>

873
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it would be really hard to fucking get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your points across because you've got to</v>

874
00:37:34.391 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of like jump in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

875
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and this is what happens when you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like Sam Harris and a guy like Ben </v>

876
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Affleck and Ben Affleck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're saying you're so racist,</v>

877
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

878
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

879
00:37:43.451 --> 00:37:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having an hour to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

880
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>well why don't you tell me why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist and give me your thoughts in the </v>

881
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Middle East and tell me what you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about,</v>

882
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x amount of people who are so entangled </v>

883
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.650
<v Speaker 1>in their ideology that they want death </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon people.</v>

884
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.660
<v Speaker 1>They wish death upon people who leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>the religion.</v>

885
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you would do about that.</v>

886
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you do about people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's wrong to have women go </v>

887
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.700
<v Speaker 1>to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you would do about.</v>

888
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:14.620
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can call it Islam,</v>

889
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you can call it the moonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call it,</v>

890
00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:18.430
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can call it whatever the fuck you want,</v>

891
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but what it really is is a rigid set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

892
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's these are ideologies that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to subscribe to a predetermined </v>

893
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you are not in that predetermined</v>

894
00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:35.731
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior and thinking they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wished death upon you and they think </v>

895
00:38:35.731 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 1>that they should be able stone you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a homosexual,</v>

896
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 2>they should be able to stone you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an adulterer,</v>

897
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a horrible video online of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor woman whose father throws the first</v>

898
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 2>rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

899
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

900
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.510
<v Speaker 2>She wants to touch him before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he kills her and he,</v>

901
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 2>he won't touch her hand and he hits her </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rock.</v>

902
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.490
<v Speaker 2>But think about the absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

903
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 2>there's so much here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

904
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:57.880
<v Speaker 2>So thinking about the absurdity of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the hatred for these people,</v>

905
00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 2>the hatred for Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Bill Maher.</v>

906
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 2>So whether you like them or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say it sucks,</v>

907
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:08.310
<v Speaker 2>what I know is that the constructs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those talk show format suck those </v>

908
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.540
<v Speaker 2>splitscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bill o'reilly things bill talks and </v>

909
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 2>three experts shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll be right back.</v>

910
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just not enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

911
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher loves Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he had them on the show last </v>

912
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:20.370
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

913
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:20.370
<v Speaker 2>He only had six minutes with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

914
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what year you would do with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

915
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:28.111
<v Speaker 2>If he was here right now we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could literally talk all day and he </v>

916
00:39:28.111 --> 00:39:31.861
<v Speaker 2>should and he should and should have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show like that where it's just bill </v>

917
00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:36.810
<v Speaker 2>sitting down with these people and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being forced into that fucking </v>

918
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>soundbitey type of conversation because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're doing.</v>

919
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love bill,</v>

920
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have that that day,</v>

921
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 2>so thank you for that and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking let him.</v>

922
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.540
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that format is like </v>

923
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:51.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks that everybody needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like fast,</v>

924
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>

925
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:53.620
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case.</v>

926
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think both of us are proof that it's </v>

927
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.781
<v Speaker 2>not the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a long time everything was </v>

928
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:00.781
<v Speaker 2>getting smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Internet burst.</v>

929
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:02.790
<v Speaker 2>This thing twitter came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk in 140 characters.</v>

930
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Buying came at six seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything kept getting smaller,</v>

931
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

932
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:11.130
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm absolutely seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've only been doing my show in its </v>

933
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.760
<v Speaker 2>current incarnation for two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam was my first guest.</v>

934
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 2>This was the first week in September and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started doing long form stuff again,</v>

935
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:19.230
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I've seen is the more,</v>

936
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.600
<v Speaker 2>the longer we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we extrapolate ideas,</v>

937
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 2>talk about stuff and don't scream at </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

938
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm bringing on people on the right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left and the more that we do </v>

939
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:30.060
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more people want.</v>

940
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's a bounce back now </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that short thing,</v>

941
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody on television,</v>

942
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.500
<v Speaker 2>they start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 2>and it's partly like a show that I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>on espn.</v>

944
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Pardon the interruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would have the countdown going,</v>

945
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything had to be quick,</v>

946
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:43.000
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

947
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

948
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.260
<v Speaker 2>But I think people are actually ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

949
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think clearly,</v>

950
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:53.851
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why this is working for </v>

951
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:53.851
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

952
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>People want to actually hear a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

953
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:59.221
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear two things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily line up and let's hear </v>

954
00:40:59.221 --> 00:41:02.190
<v Speaker 2>people that I listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that plenty of people that will </v>

955
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.740
<v Speaker 2>be listening to this will disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

956
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:05.020
<v Speaker 2>will disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end we'll go,</v>

957
00:41:05.021 --> 00:41:10.021
<v Speaker 2>well it's not because they're racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they got some ideas that let's </v>

958
00:41:10.021 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 2>challenge those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the entertainment aspect of</v>

959
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:17.071
<v Speaker 2>those shows where there's like five </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in a room and then also you have </v>

960
00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 2>a fucking audience that cheers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree and some and some of them are just</v>

961
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>so lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so super fucking applauding and every.</v>

962
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Because he shuts up his own audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

963
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.730
<v Speaker 2>how many Qa?</v>

964
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I've literally seen him do standup where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's yelled at the audience for giving </v>

965
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:33.930
<v Speaker 2>him applause breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

966
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.690
<v Speaker 2>how many times have you ever seen that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a comedy show?</v>

967
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.960
<v Speaker 2>That that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

968
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

969
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 2>during his show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does do that with people chime in,</v>

970
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that the entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of,</v>

971
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 2>of expressing yourself almost sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes precedent over the concepts and </v>

972
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:55.121
<v Speaker 2>the ideas themselves because it's all in</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you deliver it and how forcefully </v>

973
00:41:55.121 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you can get it past the other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to say contrary points.</v>

974
00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:02.261
<v Speaker 2>So the Ben Affleck thing is the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of that because by yelling out </v>

975
00:42:02.261 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 2>gross and racist within a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

976
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 2>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much the worst thing you can</v>

977
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:07.490
<v Speaker 2>say about somebody right to call them </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

978
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

979
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.980
<v Speaker 2>beyond you're a child molester or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

980
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much the worst thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

981
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Think about if you were having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument with somebody about,</v>

982
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:19.530
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you were privately arguing </v>

983
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:19.530
<v Speaker 2>with someone about Islam and religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and blah blah,</v>

984
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.161
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would take a while for you to call </v>

985
00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:24.161
<v Speaker 2>them racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

986
00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't do it to go pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep by the time that you personally got</v>

987
00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:32.381
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that place where you were to say you </v>

988
00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:32.381
<v Speaker 2>are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would even,</v>

989
00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I would probably say that idea is </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

990
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:40.151
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would even say your racist </v>

991
00:42:40.151 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 2>because I got to think that like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>

992
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have black friends.</v>

993
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Well what do you like about black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

994
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you go into that for and at the end</v>

995
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they smell different.</v>

996
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I like to be around people that are done</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

997
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking racist.</v>

998
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 2>You're a racist.</v>

999
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1000
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1001
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:57.701
<v Speaker 2>but that illustrates your point </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly that the problem with these </v>

1002
00:42:57.701 --> 00:43:00.611
<v Speaker 2>shows and the problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion and problem with social </v>

1003
00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:03.311
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all like a perfect storm of </v>

1004
00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:04.550
<v Speaker 2>craziness because the next day after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show,</v>

1005
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Speaker 2>all the online sites mediate everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The headlines were all Ben Affleck Calls</v>

1006
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:15.401
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher and Sam Harris Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly the onus was on them to </v>

1007
00:43:15.401 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 2>prove that they are not raised exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not only is that bonkers,</v>

1008
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:22.961
<v Speaker 2>but I asked them about this and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something that I thought was </v>

1009
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:25.511
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on that show to discuss his book </v>

1010
00:43:25.511 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 2>called Waking Up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a spiritual guide to a guide to</v>

1011
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:30.900
<v Speaker 2>spirituality without religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's talking about meditation.</v>

1012
00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.690
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about inner peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read the book,</v>

1013
00:43:32.691 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some pretty lofty stuff.</v>

1014
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that point forward,</v>

1015
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>the next six months in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on a book tour about inner peace,</v>

1016
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 2>but all I had to do is defend myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not a racist.</v>

1017
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.960
<v Speaker 2>How cosmically war that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1018
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 2>and it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe Ben Affleck wanting to state a</v>

1019
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.160
<v Speaker 2>position that he felt would be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular and when resonate it would get </v>

1020
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>him social brownie points because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>

1021
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 2>What he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they express themselves.</v>

1022
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not nuanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not objective is not complex and </v>

1023
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.221
<v Speaker 2>well thought out and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very deep and important subject and </v>

1024
00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:12.951
<v Speaker 2>massively important subject because what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about in 2015 when you </v>

1025
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:16.830
<v Speaker 2>talking about any ancient religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about clinging to these </v>

1026
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:21.221
<v Speaker 2>ideas that were formed and ingrained in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities well before science.</v>

1027
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Well before people had a deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of human psychology.</v>

1028
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Of human nature of the power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestion and culture and well before </v>

1029
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 2>we understood the the world actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>works as far as like as far as nature,</v>

1030
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:40.131
<v Speaker 2>as far as physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as just the formation of the </v>

1031
00:44:40.131 --> 00:44:40.131
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1032
00:44:40.131 --> 00:44:43.370
<v Speaker 2>All of this information is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable to most of the religions in </v>

1033
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only are you right,</v>

1034
00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:49.521
<v Speaker 2>but that's even what Sam wrote in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the faith that fat fucking Batman before</v>

1035
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:55.371
<v Speaker 2>the movie even came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new Batman like think how insane </v>

1036
00:44:55.371 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really step back and dissect what</v>

1037
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 2>you just said there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you took what the average person</v>

1038
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 2>thought over the world and of science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and medicine and everything that we know</v>

1039
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:08.241
<v Speaker 2>of and food and everything in 1840 by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that standard now in 2015,</v>

1040
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:13.671
<v Speaker 2>that person would look pretty damn dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason these books that </v>

1041
00:45:13.671 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 2>were written thousands of years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1042
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>somehow those have some validity that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should still respect.</v>

1043
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't respect these books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're ideas.</v>

1044
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>They're ideas that time has long since </v>
<v Speaker 2>let go of.</v>

1045
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 2>So by respecting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually doing something crazy.</v>

1046
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 2>If we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we really want to be free,</v>

1047
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:34.791
<v Speaker 2>if we want to be free thinkers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I don't give a fuck about </v>

1048
00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 2>anyone's race or religion or sex or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>

1049
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I judge people on what they say and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think and what the social justice </v>

1050
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.981
<v Speaker 2>warriors are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to win this argument by </v>

1051
00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:45.981
<v Speaker 2>shutting everybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1052
00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>and they they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a degree of them doing </v>

1053
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 2>it for lofty reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Ben Affleck thinks in his lofty,</v>

1054
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 2>rich Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1055
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 2>that he's helping the downtrodden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something he does really</v>

1056
00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>know entirely circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1057
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Because I know too many actors and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what they are and you know,</v>

1058
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 2>here's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about actors,</v>

1059
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 2>and this is not all actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously just like,</v>

1060
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all comics are heroin addicts and </v>

1061
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:13.610
<v Speaker 2>drug addicts and whatever.</v>

1062
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that what it is to be an actor </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to pretend to be something else.</v>

1063
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1064
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:23.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is and it's also you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get passed the audition process and </v>

1065
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 2>the audition process is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying all the right things.</v>

1066
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 2>So Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever you're from,</v>

1067
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.340
<v Speaker 2>where'd you grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to like,</v>

1068
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you know who you voted for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

1069
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:36.230
<v Speaker 2>there's that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why Hollywood liens </v>

1070
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.230
<v Speaker 2>almost entirely left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1071
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:40.011
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they really do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think a lot of them are </v>

1072
00:46:40.011 --> 00:46:40.011
<v Speaker 2>secretly voting Republican taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1073
00:46:40.011 --> 00:46:44.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got your Charleston Heston's in </v>

1074
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:44.770
<v Speaker 2>your fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:48.251
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few John voight's out there </v>

1076
00:46:48.251 --> 00:46:50.451
<v Speaker 2>and the guy from the was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be back in two and two with a </v>

1077
00:46:50.451 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 2>chuckle or chuck will follow him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter just to laugh at all the fucking</v>

1078
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Republican Shit that he writes.</v>

1079
00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:01.070
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always gonna be a few Hollywood </v>

1080
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.871
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously Chuck woolery is not in any </v>

1081
00:47:02.871 --> 00:47:05.571
<v Speaker 2>big movies like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there always going to be a few </v>

1082
00:47:05.571 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 2>conservatives in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The casting people,</v>

1083
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the producers,</v>

1084
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:13.101
<v Speaker 2>the executives overwhelmingly left </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning and to be in that club you have </v>

1085
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 2>to agree with them and there's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that whole audition process when it</v>

1086
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:23.210
<v Speaker 2>comes to actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't work unless someone approves </v>

1087
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.421
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless someone takes you in and accepts </v>

1088
00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:26.421
<v Speaker 2>you and chooses you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

1089
00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 2>you're the right guy for the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1090
00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're.</v>

1091
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And you can't say anything controversial</v>

1092
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.930
<v Speaker 4>that will fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're essentially like,</v>

1093
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 4>you're on a dating program for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1094
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not dating,</v>

1095
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:42.361
<v Speaker 4>like you're trying to get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you're trying to get the world </v>

1096
00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:42.361
<v Speaker 4>to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:42.361
<v Speaker 4>So when a guy like Ben Affleck who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been doing this,</v>

1098
00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:47.341
<v Speaker 4>his whole life gets on that show and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone says something that he thinks I </v>

1099
00:47:47.341 --> 00:47:49.090
<v Speaker 4>can get in here and make some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>

1100
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 4>I can get some social brownie points up </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the board.</v>

1101
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 4>I think that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're racist and this is gross.</v>

1102
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 4>He's just like a guy at an audition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's full of Shit.</v>

1103
00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:01.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what Rogan I'm going to prove </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you right now that I,</v>

1104
00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:02.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't just say shit,</v>

1105
00:48:02.371 --> 00:48:03.960
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it because you've changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind.</v>

1106
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:09.020
<v Speaker 3>That argument was good enough that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've changed my mind that I do agree </v>

1107
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.171
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't doing it out of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>lofty thing that it's purely that I'm </v>

1108
00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:12.171
<v Speaker 3>with I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be a,</v>

1109
00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can split hairs a little bit </v>

1110
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's 80 slash 20 or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that actually does make more</v>

1111
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:21.531
<v Speaker 3>sense and it also explains why it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened within a minute because he was </v>

1112
00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.370
<v Speaker 3>ready for it to happen before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>segment even started.</v>

1113
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.500
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

1114
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 4>I think there are also sociopath to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in philanthropic ventures to </v>

1115
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.650
<v Speaker 4>make themselves look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

1116
00:48:30.651 --> 00:48:35.651
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely 100 percent believe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people do some philanthropic shit </v>

1117
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 4>so that it makes them look better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1118
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:38.810
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

1119
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.830
<v Speaker 4>this is sort of to mask the psychosis </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bubbles below the surface of their </v>

1120
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:46.040
<v Speaker 4>skin that they're trying to hide from </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1121
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't go after me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I work with the firefighters,</v>

1122
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1123
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:50.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1124
00:48:50.301 --> 00:48:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I support the first responders </v>
<v Speaker 4>responders,</v>

1125
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm down with the firefighters.</v>

1126
00:48:55.071 --> 00:48:58.250
<v Speaker 4>You can't call me a plagiarist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can like send Dusky,</v>

1127
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 4>like we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll be working with little kids </v>

1128
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 4>helping all these little kids won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>securely.</v>

1129
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.730
<v Speaker 4>That guy's not fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could he do that?</v>

1130
00:49:04.731 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 4>He loves the children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

1131
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 4>that is the kind of shit that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a lot evil</v>

1132
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is interesting.</v>

1133
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 3>So for comics then it really is </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly bizarre because there's the</v>

1134
00:49:14.501 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 3>approval thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1135
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 3>And comics want approval just the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way actors,</v>

1136
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:23.850
<v Speaker 3>but comics are also the good ones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately there's not many of us </v>

1137
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.870
<v Speaker 3>left that you're supposed to stake out </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial positions.</v>

1138
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 3>So that goes against the sort of mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>approval thing,</v>

1139
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't in comedy but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But right now he's counterculture.</v>

1140
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>

1141
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does any.</v>

1142
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.870
<v Speaker 3>Is there any comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple people I guess,</v>

1143
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 3>that are doing some counterculture </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1144
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Letter.</v>

1145
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Getting credit for find counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What counterculture that you'd be?</v>

1146
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.830
<v Speaker 3>You'd be really against the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be against the administration,</v>

1147
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be fighting more for some of the </v>

1148
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.941
<v Speaker 3>things that I think we're doing with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice where yourself fighting </v>

1149
00:49:53.941 --> 00:49:57.211
<v Speaker 3>for free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relentlessly fighting against bad ideas </v>

1150
00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:01.531
<v Speaker 3>so you could be fighting against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of Islam without being racist or </v>

1151
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you're going to race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but without even being,</v>

1152
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 3>without being bigoted towards Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1153
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Like right now I think partially because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Obama,</v>

1154
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to like the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1155
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Just by his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the.</v>

1156
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:15.040
<v Speaker 3>He's black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's cool.</v>

1157
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:20.041
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to play basketball with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd be fun to have a drink </v>

1158
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:22.891
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's cool to like the power right </v>

1159
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:22.891
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a weird way,</v>

1160
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:26.941
<v Speaker 3>I think if we have a republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>president next time comedy's going to </v>

1161
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>get a lot better real quick because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a lot easier to</v>

1162
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it cool to like him?</v>

1163
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the facts is a cool to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at the ways attacked,</v>

1164
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 1>whistleblowers is like nobody's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1165
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are,</v>

1166
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of people are they are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

1167
00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1168
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of really smart people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are attacking it.</v>

1169
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that guy's truck trussell,</v>

1170
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell Kurt Metzger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of like very smart comics </v>

1171
00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that just think it's fucking gross that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a guy that's killed more </v>

1172
00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 1>innocent people with drones or been </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for being the lead.</v>

1173
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.200
<v Speaker 1>The commander and chief of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>army in the world has ever known that </v>

1174
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 1>has caused thousands of people to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocently through drone strikes.</v>

1175
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 1>You know that like they're shooting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>

1176
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting missiles at where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone is and that's what,</v>

1177
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what metadata is.</v>

1178
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:14.730
<v Speaker 1>We just blew up that hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blew up that hospital and you know,</v>

1179
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 1>we could get into a whole thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1180
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.020
<v Speaker 1>about the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there,</v>

1181
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.040
<v Speaker 1>there's terrible shit or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whistleblower thing I think is a good </v>

1182
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 1>spot because you hear Edward Snowden on </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1183
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson's show.</v>

1184
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1185
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 1>You should listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1186
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.600
<v Speaker 1>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please go look,</v>

1187
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what Obama is doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>

1188
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason that Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressives,</v>

1190
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:39.860
<v Speaker 1>when Obama got in immediately we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1191
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to try,</v>

1192
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:46.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheney for war crimes and Blah Blah </v>

1193
00:51:46.391 --> 00:51:46.391
<v Speaker 1>Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason why he didn't.</v>

1194
00:51:46.391 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't just about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also because he's killing a lot </v>

1195
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 1>of people with drones right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 20 years from now,</v>

1196
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want that president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Willow Smith or whoever it's </v>

1197
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 1>going to be to come in.</v>

1198
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And Samantha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like j dot j.</v>

1199
00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 1>that's pink isn't going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1200
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess Jayden probably would be the </v>

1201
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 1>president and curse there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1202
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.560
<v Speaker 1>but like whoever is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be one of them.</v>

1203
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I might vote for will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

1204
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.030
<v Speaker 1>You'd vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1205
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I had my vote for will smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he running?</v>

1206
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a smart motherfucker and I </v>

1207
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like when I listened to him talk,</v>

1208
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a balanced and intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard that expresses himself very well.</v>

1209
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 1>He's extremely well read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a scientologist A.</v>

1210
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's a scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's dabbled.</v>

1211
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So as Jerry Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look.</v>

1212
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I bought dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought it on an online,</v>

1213
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>not even online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it from one of those late night </v>

1214
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.120
<v Speaker 1>infomercials in 1994 when I first moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Hollywood.</v>

1215
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember those commercials all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the middle of the night for me </v>

1216
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.280
<v Speaker 1>while I'm in the middle of Lawrence </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wright's going clear hallways.</v>

1217
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I can read it for too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1218
00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I go to other books because I read it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a few chapters and I go,</v>

1219
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck this because it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing on Hbs,</v>

1220
00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I started the book first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I watched the thing on hbo and then</v>

1221
00:52:57.831 --> 00:52:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't finished.</v>

1222
00:52:59.751 --> 00:53:04.751
<v Speaker 1>It's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got like probably I'm probably </v>

1223
00:53:04.751 --> 00:53:04.751
<v Speaker 1>halfway in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1224
00:53:04.751 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1225
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird about Kendall's.</v>

1226
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that you're halfway in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see numbers like I like,</v>

1227
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I like a thickness thing where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down to the bottom.</v>

1228
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I got like a very thin.</v>

1229
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 1>But even the numbers on that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean anything to me.</v>

1230
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Those numbers at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show,</v>

1231
00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on page 100 and 500 pages.</v>

1232
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not registering.</v>

1233
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide if someone in this </v>

1234
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.091
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much information to put in your </v>

1235
00:53:35.091 --> 00:53:37.251
<v Speaker 1>brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the things that I </v>

1236
00:53:37.251 --> 00:53:37.251
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem.</v>

1237
00:53:37.251 --> 00:53:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I struggle with this all the time </v>

1238
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.271
<v Speaker 1>because I love politics and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I've been going to the spin </v>

1239
00:53:41.271 --> 00:53:41.271
<v Speaker 1>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about some politics stuff.</v>

1240
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love all that stuff and I love </v>

1241
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.381
<v Speaker 1>current events and I love Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and I love talking about </v>

1242

00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do find sometimes I can't.</v>

1246
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much coming into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1247
00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the couch and I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld,</v>

1249
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:07.071
<v Speaker 1>which I should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be the time that I can shut my </v>

1250
00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:09.381
<v Speaker 1>brain down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write an episode that I've seen 150 </v>

1251

<v Speaker 1>it's like minority report from health </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really struggled with that,</v>

1254
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 1>like shutting it down sometimes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1255
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:28.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices but just actually the stuff </v>

1256

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

1258
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately I don't necessarily really </v>

1259
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 1>have to know my shit because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit I'll have to do is say I'm not</v>

1260
00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:42.600
<v Speaker 1>sure about that and I'm okay because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian,</v>

1261
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1262
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean,</v>

1263
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 1>like especially in these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations like you and I,</v>

1264
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we exchanged some emails about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that'd be cool to talk about,</v>

1265
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have a format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're all over the place where</v>

1266
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.960
<v Speaker 1>gay discos and Ben Affleck's Douche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher's formats are antiquated and </v>

1267
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only have so much information in</v>

1268
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:10.011
<v Speaker 1>your head and this is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that I have with is going clear </v>

1269
00:55:10.011 --> 00:55:12.471
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why keep going to it and then going to </v>

1270
00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:12.471
<v Speaker 1>other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because I feel like,</v>

1271
00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 1>why am I fucking reading so much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sociopath fucking nightmare,</v>

1272
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:18.250
<v Speaker 1>crazy cult leader dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1273
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has formed this insane religion </v>

1274
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 1>because I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of me can't put it down.</v>

1275
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started reading about all the crazy </v>

1276
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.441
<v Speaker 1>shit that he did and how nutty this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>really was and how many people followed </v>

1277
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 1>his wacky ideas.</v>

1278
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 1>That becomes fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be talking about scientology or </v>

1279
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:44.271
<v Speaker 1>any religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could some wacky guy with some crazy </v>

1280
00:55:44.271 --> 00:55:44.271
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a thought.</v>

1281
00:55:44.271 --> 00:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Somebody was talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know.</v>

1282
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there wasn't a lot of cash.</v>

1283
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1284
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's different ones and </v>

1285
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.450
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the followers,</v>

1286
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.620
<v Speaker 1>like Mormons are notoriously nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1287
00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I could tell that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdest religions because there so </v>

1288
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then like if you go to Islam,</v>

1289
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed was a warlord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's got a very different type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion when first of all,</v>

1291
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the environment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people live in is extremely </v>

1292
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 1>hostile as far as the temperature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely hot.</v>

1293
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1294
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:18.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle for natural resources is very</v>

1295
00:56:18.511 --> 00:56:19.950
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the end.</v>

1296
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You're also dealing with the cradle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and I have this bit about</v>

1297
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Islam that it never really came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruition,</v>

1298
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:31.111
<v Speaker 4>but the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even Islam but the Middle East </v>

1299
00:56:31.111 --> 00:56:32.791
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the Middle East is essentially like </v>

1300
00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:35.580
<v Speaker 4>they're the townies of the world because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where culture was created and </v>

1301
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 4>everybody looked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings were created in Africa.</v>

1302
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 4>That's where the first human beings came</v>
<v Speaker 4>from out by however method,</v>

1303
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.400
<v Speaker 4>whether you believe in heaven,</v>

1304
00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:48.590
<v Speaker 3>illusion and the drop some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A promethium fucking terrible to be </v>

1305
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it to be good.</v>

1306
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I watched the beginning again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1307
00:56:55.230 --> 00:57:00.230
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the guy and he comes down and he </v>

1308
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.230
<v Speaker 3>splits the thing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1309
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.640
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened here?</v>

1310
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that he ceded the world with</v>
<v Speaker 4>his DNA and then he knew somehow or </v>

1311
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 4>another would develop and the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

1312
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Why did shortlist ron not move a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the left when the thing was falling?</v>

1313
00:57:10.521 --> 00:57:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Remember the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1314
00:57:11.911 --> 00:57:14.300
<v Speaker 3>There's the giant ship and it's falling </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all she has to do,</v>

1315
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.850
<v Speaker 3>she's running straight in the ships ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this way and it's slow.</v>

1316
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Real slow.</v>

1317
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.610
<v Speaker 4>I want you to do is go a little panic </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>

1318
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.550
<v Speaker 4>She just freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She freaked out or panicked.</v>

1319
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can get into that all day.</v>

1320
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.520
<v Speaker 4>She made up for it in a Mad Max.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:28.740
<v Speaker 4>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1322
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.110
<v Speaker 4>what was my point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck</v>

1323
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 3>we're going took you somewhere there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The beginning of the world.</v>

1324
00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamia</v>

1325
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.640
<v Speaker 4>came from this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1326
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1327
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.270
<v Speaker 4>the most ancient version of a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>

1328
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 4>I think they think that we're in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>current form,</v>

1329
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.500
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think they're thinking it's like </v>

1330
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:49.500
<v Speaker 4>250,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus years,</v>

1331
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.011
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whatever that was at one point in </v>

1332
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:55.711
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they left Africa and a lot of them </v>

1333
00:57:55.711 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 4>settled in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt of course is a part of Africa,</v>

1334
00:57:56.591 --> 00:58:01.591
<v Speaker 4>but it is in the Middle East officially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they spread out all throughout the </v>

1335
00:58:01.591 --> 00:58:01.670
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

1336
00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:04.750
<v Speaker 4>the oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we know today as far as we know,</v>

1337
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.390
<v Speaker 4>the oldest written language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oldest,</v>

1338
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1339
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:14.340
<v Speaker 4>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oldest government structure was </v>

1340
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Sumir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where Iraq is,</v>

1341
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is you're dealing with like 6,000</v>

1342
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.310
<v Speaker 4>plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1343
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 4>that's Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1344
00:58:19.811 --> 00:58:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1345
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 4>that's the cradle of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking shit hole,</v>

1346
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 4>a crazy wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up civil war.</v>

1347
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:32.641
<v Speaker 4>The Muslims are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Muslims that she has and the </v>

1348
00:58:32.641 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 4>Sudanese are blowing each other up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>roadside bombs.</v>

1349
00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 4>And it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's chaos.</v>

1350
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:41.011
<v Speaker 4>And when you get to these parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world that are amongst the most ancient </v>

1351
00:58:41.011 --> 00:58:45.601
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have what I call the echoes of </v>

1352
00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:48.241
<v Speaker 4>savages is like the culture has lasted </v>
<v Speaker 4>for so long and the reverberations of </v>

1353
00:58:50.411 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 4>these ancient ideas that have been long </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproven and they're still there,</v>

1354
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>permeated.</v>

1355
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1356
00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:59.250
<v Speaker 3>that's why the Middle East especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could also talk about Israel,</v>

1357
00:58:59.251 --> 00:59:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Palestinian people and all of it is such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cluster fuck because so you could take</v>

1358
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:07.380
<v Speaker 3>someone like Sam who will talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the religious part,</v>

1359
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.690
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'll mostly blame religion and then</v>

1360
00:59:09.691 --> 00:59:14.691
<v Speaker 3>you can take a lot of my friends on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and they say it's all geopolitics </v>

1361
00:59:14.691 --> 00:59:15.660
<v Speaker 3>and they usually blame the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1362
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.580
<v Speaker 3>The truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as I said before,</v>

1363
00:59:17.581 --> 00:59:22.581
<v Speaker 3>we have to have two thoughts at once and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's very hard for people to be </v>

1364
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:22.581
<v Speaker 3>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's both.</v>

1365
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It is both in the most extreme ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1366
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 2>first of Iraq and Syria right now are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not even countries.</v>

1367
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Your by any estimation of what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning country is that would </v>

1368
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 2>partake in the world thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor is Libya.</v>

1369
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Libya is not in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1370
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 2>we did think about Libya for second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama did that.</v>

1371
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 2>No Congressional authorization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1372
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Everyone goes crazy on Bush about Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously in retrospect,</v>

1373
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 2>the Iraq war is pretty bad and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly make a line to it led to Isis,</v>

1374
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 2>which then has now dba destabilize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing,</v>

1375
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 2>but he at least had congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorization.</v>

1376
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe he lied where we know now know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were planting evidence and all</v>

1377
00:59:56.601 --> 01:00:01.601
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Obama went into Libya right when he </v>

1378
01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:02.480
<v Speaker 2>became president with no congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorization.</v>

1379
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what's going on in Libya </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1380
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a country?</v>

1381
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen a board Danes show on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CNN show?</v>

1382
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it has.</v>

1383
01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:15.611
<v Speaker 2>There been a Libyan just watching it </v>
<v Speaker 2>last night about a Ethiopia that shows </v>

1384
01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1385
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing.</v>

1386
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.490
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1387
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was shit when Kadafi was running it,</v>

1388
01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 2>obviously it was a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible place and he was a terrible </v>

1389
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 2>evil dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you remove a dictator,</v>

1390
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>you create a vacuum and that vacuum gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucked up by people that want to try to </v>

1391
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>claim power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1392
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:39.911
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the strange thing about the </v>

1393
01:00:39.911 --> 01:00:39.911
<v Speaker 2>neocons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1394
01:00:39.911 --> 01:00:42.611
<v Speaker 2>So neo-cons believed that we should use </v>
<v Speaker 2>our American power to either nation </v>

1395
01:00:42.611 --> 01:00:44.780
<v Speaker 2>build or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know,</v>

1396
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 2>and everyone on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>

1397
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:50.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it because we want their </v>

1398
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:50.681
<v Speaker 2>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's again,</v>

1399
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.441
<v Speaker 2>it's one of these things that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>zillion reasons why everyone wants some </v>

1400
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 2>piece of that part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people will say,</v>

1401
01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq was better off with Saddam.</v>

1402
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>He was doing horrible things to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1403
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>He was using mustard gas on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the courage,</v>

1404
01:01:03.011 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Kurds.</v>

1405
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've,</v>

1406
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>we've helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We backed leaders.</v>

1407
01:01:08.151 --> 01:01:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Mubarak in Egypt was our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We backed him.</v>

1408
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:16.031
<v Speaker 2>Then they overthrew him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we backed the Muslim Brotherhood </v>

1409
01:01:16.031 --> 01:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>than they overthrew them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're backing another Mubarak I </v>

1410
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just do.</v>

1411
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Our policies are all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all military industrial complex and</v>

1412
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 2>it's just this endless cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness over there.</v>

1413
01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get any crazier than having a </v>

1414
01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.291
<v Speaker 2>guy like Dick Cheney as the vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>president who the CEO of Halliburton </v>

1415
01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 2>accompany the rebuilds places that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow up.</v>

1416
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a shorts and egor movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1417
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:40.481
<v Speaker 2>Like he's the bad guy in shorts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acrimony from the eighties or the bad </v>

1418
01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:40.481
<v Speaker 2>guy in Rambo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1419
01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.490
<v Speaker 2>it's almost so obvious and that's why we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't believe it.</v>

1420
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ain't because they're showing it to </v>

1421
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1422
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Here's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1423
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton,</v>

1424
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.651
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a lot of shit in Iraq </v>

1425
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:53.651
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's coincidence?</v>

1426
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got no bid contracts.</v>

1427
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have other people who are </v>

1428
01:01:59.590 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 2>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>

1429
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>What do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>

1430
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:07.390
<v Speaker 2>We hope that inflammation and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution of information that's </v>

1431
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.030
<v Speaker 2>available today that was barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>available when Bush was in office and we</v>

1432
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:16.031
<v Speaker 2>hope that the spread of that and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of that will balance out </v>

1433
01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:17.990
<v Speaker 2>all this shit and I'm hoping that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case with social justice warriors.</v>

1434
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that's the case with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing</v>

1435
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 4>fucking fanatics that want to blow up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and bomb and invade everything that </v>

1436
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.331
<v Speaker 4>doesn't believe in Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping that all that stuff gets </v>

1437
01:02:29.331 --> 01:02:32.631
<v Speaker 4>balanced out because I think the amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of change that we've experienced in our </v>

1438
01:02:32.631 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 4>lifetime is unprecedented cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>change information will change,</v>

1439
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:36.180
<v Speaker 4>has been the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1440
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the invention of the Internet.</v>

1441
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fully believe that when we go back and</v>

1442
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 4>historians look at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1443
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.751
<v Speaker 4>they see it as an explosion of change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a veritable explosion of ideas and </v>

1444
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 4>have the ability to express themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your show represents that your,</v>

1445
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:55.140
<v Speaker 4>your podcast represents that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have anybody telling you what to do.</v>

1446
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 4>You can talk about whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

1447
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:00.270
<v Speaker 4>there's no studio execs come in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop Dave.</v>

1448
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 4>We've got to get off this subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave,</v>

1449
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:05.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't talk about Ben Affleck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're doing a film with Ben.</v>

1450
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.710
<v Speaker 4>One of our subsidiaries is very upset </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this and that and that.</v>

1451
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the affiliates are calling in right now.</v>

1452
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:15.921
<v Speaker 4>They want to cancel our program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna have to figure out a way to </v>

1453
01:03:15.921 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 4>do this better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said some bad things about abilify.</v>

1454
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Abilify is one of our new sponsors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you should ask your doctor about it </v>

1455
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 4>because maybe you need it.</v>

1456
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then my cloud gets even bigger.</v>

1457
01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:24.050
<v Speaker 3>That's hanging over me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really important,</v>

1458
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.260
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you,</v>

1459
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 3>but do you think we've gotten to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking point with that because I think</v>

1460
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:33.501
<v Speaker 3>one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons that I wanted to do </v>

1461
01:03:33.501 --> 01:03:35.241
<v Speaker 3>this with you and I've been harassing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to come on my show forever is </v>

1462
01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:37.941
<v Speaker 3>because I see the things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about and our audiences are so </v>

1463
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 3>interlaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1464
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.400
<v Speaker 3>And I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really believe it has a lot to do with </v>

1465
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.130
<v Speaker 3>the Sam thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's been.</v>

1466
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.210
<v Speaker 3>We're close to the tipping point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeating the Social Justice Warriors.</v>

1467
01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I really think themselves right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1468
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 3>because because identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately has to eat itself.</v>

1469
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the fatal flaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they'll take someone like Bernie</v>

1470
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Sanders who stands for every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive principle known to man.</v>

1471
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want money in politics.</v>

1472
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.430
<v Speaker 3>He's everything that the left wants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>

1473
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.640
<v Speaker 3>He has black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People grabbing the mic away from him a </v>

1474
01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>month ago screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care enough about black lives</v>

1475
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's no reason to believe that,</v>

1476
01:04:17.161 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 3>but if but if you parse everyone down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their one issue,</v>

1477
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.240
<v Speaker 3>so if you say that these people are only</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to care about black lives matter </v>

1478
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.390
<v Speaker 3>and these people are only going to care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about abortion and these people are only</v>

1479
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:29.580
<v Speaker 3>going to care about Islam or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1480
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you ultimately your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just a group of people who </v>

1481
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 3>ultimately have interests that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with each other and you're</v>

1482
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:41.511
<v Speaker 3>going to destroy each other and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why I think the reaction to this is so </v>

1483
01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>good and so powerful and I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

1484
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel it.</v>

1485
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Well when that black lives matter thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>

1486
01:04:47.061 --> 01:04:49.190
<v Speaker 4>those girls were screaming and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was saying,</v>

1487
01:04:49.191 --> 01:04:51.290
<v Speaker 4>we're going to give them the mic from </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

1488
01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:56.291
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not how you get to express </v>

1489
01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:56.291
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not how you do it.</v>

1490
01:04:56.291 --> 01:05:00.821
<v Speaker 4>You don't interrupt and decide that your</v>
<v Speaker 4>message is more important than their </v>

1491
01:05:00.821 --> 01:05:00.821
<v Speaker 4>mess.</v>

1492
01:05:00.821 --> 01:05:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course their format,</v>

1493
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.520
<v Speaker 3>their place with their microphone at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

1494
01:05:04.521 --> 01:05:09.521
<v Speaker 3>What did they probably end up doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any empirical evidence on </v>

1495
01:05:09.521 --> 01:05:09.770
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they probably ended up strengthening</v>

1496
01:05:09.771 --> 01:05:11.720
<v Speaker 3>the people that don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what this,</v>

1497
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.820
<v Speaker 3>what this is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1498
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:15.950
<v Speaker 3>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much to it,</v>

1499
01:05:15.951 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the social justice</v>

1500
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>warrior thing and it has a lot the Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the way that they treated him.</v>

1501
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1502
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Greenwald and Reza and my former </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss Janko.</v>

1503
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:31.201
<v Speaker 2>I know you've had on here the way these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people treated him in this dishonest </v>

1504
01:05:31.201 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>attack on ideas that it came from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1505
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to debate ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1506
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>We're on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are,</v>

1507
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 2>what is liberalism stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We believe in the debate of ideas.</v>

1508
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>You can say the people on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they're more dogmatic,</v>

1509
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 2>they're more religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to debate ideas.</v>

1510
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>So I can't deal with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right went off the deep end a long </v>

1511
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.321
<v Speaker 2>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to care about as someone </v>

1512
01:05:52.321 --> 01:05:54.991
<v Speaker 2>that's on the left and that believes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal principles and doesn't want to </v>

1513
01:05:54.991 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>see days thrown off the roof in Syria </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that shit doesn't mean I want</v>

1514
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:57.400
<v Speaker 2>to invade Syria.</v>

1515
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean you don't want to nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>build,</v>

1516
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.810
<v Speaker 2>but I should be able to talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being called a racist or </v>

1517
01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:03.810
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1518
01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and I think we've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've hit something here.</v>

1519
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that we've hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there are people that are balanced </v>

1520
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:15.450
<v Speaker 2>and that are socially aware and that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun and interesting to talk to and then </v>

1521
01:06:16.481 --> 01:06:21.010
<v Speaker 2>there's social retards and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>retards that form on the left.</v>

1522
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be unbelievably aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and douchey about really good ideas.</v>

1523
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether it's black lives matter or </v>

1524
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.731
<v Speaker 2>whether it's supporting gay rights or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's transgender rights or any </v>

1525
01:06:32.731 --> 01:06:35.791
<v Speaker 2>of the ideas that I'm sure you and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could both agree with what they're doing</v>

1526
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:40.921
<v Speaker 2>and the way they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they found something that gives them </v>

1527
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:43.471
<v Speaker 2>the green light to be an asshole and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things they're doing in being an </v>

1528
01:06:43.471 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 2>asshole is they're making up for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked on.</v>

1529
01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.560
<v Speaker 2>They're making up for being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making up for the abuse that </v>

1530
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.121
<v Speaker 2>they've suffered at other people's hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have caused them to have this </v>

1531
01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced social persona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it's all about.</v>

1532
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's about social retards with really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good points.</v>

1533
01:06:57.730 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1534
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on it.</v>

1535
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:02.740
<v Speaker 2>So you could use the gay rights thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great example of that.</v>

1536
01:07:02.741 --> 01:07:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:08.661
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have gay marriage until </v>

1538
01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:08.661
<v Speaker 2>officially it was June 26,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be my birthday.</v>

1539
01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my birthday.</v>

1540
01:07:11.021 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court said you're asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1541
01:07:13.631 --> 01:07:18.631
<v Speaker 2>I was engaged already at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kinda liked the idea of getting </v>

1542
01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:22.231
<v Speaker 2>gay married when it wasn't fully legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then I thought I'd be like </v>

1543
01:07:22.231 --> 01:07:22.231
<v Speaker 2>running from the law or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1544
01:07:22.231 --> 01:07:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Had some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I was going to be hunting a guy with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm,</v>

1546
01:07:25.631 --> 01:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who killed my wife.</v>

1547
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>None of it made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had this idea of something in my </v>

1548
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1549
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:32.050
<v Speaker 2>if you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movement,</v>

1550
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened pretty damn quick.</v>

1551
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I know gay people have wanted rights for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time,</v>

1552
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:40.021
<v Speaker 2>but if you take the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way this thing has evolved and now </v>

1553
01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:40.021
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1554
01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a straight white man.</v>

1555
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much the worst thing there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1556
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1557
01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you're just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even sitting here,</v>

1559
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 2>terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

1560
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very grating for me.</v>

1561
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the gay rights thing,</v>

1562
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 2>the left was all about it and I ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love games,</v>

1563
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:56.620
<v Speaker 2>they love gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love gays.</v>

1564
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.980
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now gays have equal rights and I know </v>

1565
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:01.980
<v Speaker 2>there's still job issues and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some stuff,</v>

1566
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 2>but we got that fucking lady in Kentucky</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1567
01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh we can.</v>

1568
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's still all kinds of shit.</v>

1569
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to say that everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

1570
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Resistance for the point is the Supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>Court,</v>

1571
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 2>the law of the land now is equal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of marriage.</v>

1572
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>But what I realized sort of halfway </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that was it's not that the left </v>

1573
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:24.851
<v Speaker 2>really cares about gays as much as sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this idea sort of of what you're </v>

1574
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because at the end of the day,</v>

1575
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>now that gay people have equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well guess what?</v>

1576
01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly gay people might start voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican because they might monitor,</v>

1577
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>vote on taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might,</v>

1578
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:35.870
<v Speaker 2>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1579
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.160
<v Speaker 2>So the identity politics thing is only </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for a little while.</v>

1580
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 2>And then once everyone's equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1581
01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:48.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a way of pitting people </v>

1582
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:48.210
<v Speaker 2>against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Then you really just become a fat person</v>
<v Speaker 2>with pink hair.</v>

1584
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you are.</v>

1585
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 2>You're not this amazing person with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral high ground that stands above and </v>

1586
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.061
<v Speaker 2>gets to proclaim how they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for rights and screaming and </v>

1587
01:09:01.061 --> 01:09:01.061
<v Speaker 2>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying.</v>

1588
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:03.580
<v Speaker 2>You're screaming and yelling and crying </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're socially retarded because</v>

1589
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 2>why are these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1590
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Speaker 2>why are they all anonymous if there so </v>
<v Speaker 2>lofty in there?</v>

1591
01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1592
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's public ones,</v>

1593
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the people that'll be yelling</v>

1594
01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:15.130
<v Speaker 2>at me over some social justice yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are some.</v>

1595
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.880
<v Speaker 2>The writers were so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1596
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.830
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not defending.</v>

1597
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 2>I think people sort of think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow I'm defending the right.</v>

1598
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.820
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with these people on.</v>

1599
01:09:24.821 --> 01:09:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to clean my house and my house is</v>

1600
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:30.290
<v Speaker 2>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want the left to be better.</v>

1601
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I fully believe now that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressives,</v>

1602
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:37.991
<v Speaker 2>which is what the progressives have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become because their ideas are now </v>

1603
01:09:37.991 --> 01:09:38.120
<v Speaker 2>regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not progressive,</v>

1604
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 2>that they are the tea party of the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the Republicans,</v>

1605
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 2>if the average conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with them or not.</v>

1606
01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Five years ago when the tea party was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaining strength and we're not going to </v>

1607
01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 2>negotiate with anyone in government shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>downs and all that,</v>

1608
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.840
<v Speaker 2>if the average conservative had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are our principles,</v>

1609
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.060
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe in limited government,</v>

1610
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 2>all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low taxes,</v>

1611
01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:02.891
<v Speaker 2>whatever strong defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would have said that they might </v>

1612
01:10:02.891 --> 01:10:03.620
<v Speaker 2>have been able to reel the tea party and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

1613
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:05.930
<v Speaker 2>but instead they just went to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst,</v>

1614
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 2>the worst piece of them and I see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening with us on the left and that's</v>

1615
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 2>why I'm so against the regressive left.</v>

1616
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.650
<v Speaker 2>We got to bring them back because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise we're going to have the </v>

1617
01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:17.650
<v Speaker 2>regressive left and we're gonna have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tea party and guess what?</v>

1618
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 2>The GIG is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>

1620
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>but I think that is what you find in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1621
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:28.660
<v Speaker 2>You find this extremely broad range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find a spectrum and that spectrum </v>

1622
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:34.270
<v Speaker 2>you have completely psychotic on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and completely psychotic horseshoe </v>

1623
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.570
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1624
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end they're the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

1626
01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's,</v>

1627
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a balance and I think that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1628
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of us given different </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances could be swayed to have </v>

1629
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.040
<v Speaker 2>different points of view and different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and I,</v>

1630
01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm also polled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a sense like logically,</v>

1631
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>but I find myself compelled when I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are really religious.</v>

1632
01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.320
<v Speaker 2>When I listened to like some Muslim guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's speaking with great confidence </v>

1633
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>and the power of Islam and the truth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

1634
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I find myself compelled.</v>

1635
01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1636
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 2>I don't support it as an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm fascinating by the natural </v>

1637
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 2>compulsion to want to join that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The natural human.</v>

1638
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unbelievably confident in what </v>

1639
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:27.141
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is the right thing and is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is proclaiming it publicly and loudly </v>

1640
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 2>through a microphone that makes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1641
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is the truth.</v>

1642
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And kinda like hit like exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

1643
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:40.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's why it's a human nature </v>

1644
01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:40.730
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is human nature.</v>

1645
01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.941
<v Speaker 2>And look if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's why they attract all these </v>

1646
01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:46.761
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that that's what's </v>

1647
01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:46.761
<v Speaker 2>going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we have to do,</v>

1648
01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:51.620
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on in the </v>

1649
01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:51.620
<v Speaker 2>universe in the scheme of I have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking idea,</v>

1650
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fertile ground for someone having</v>

1651
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 2>to make that leap of faith and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1652
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any idea.</v>

1653
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say I'm going to follow the Ten </v>

1654
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm pretty much.</v>

1655
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't believe in religion in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way whatsoever,</v>

1656
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.750
<v Speaker 2>but I get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we were to have the 10 commandments,</v>

1657
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably sure I'm pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>following them because they're just </v>

1658
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't kill people.</v>

1659
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't covet your neighbor's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a gay thing.</v>

1660
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:19.431
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was actually a property </v>

1661
01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:19.431
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1662
01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:22.170
<v Speaker 2>it was his property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You by covenant taking her.</v>

1663
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1664
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the point is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>live your life as I think both of us do </v>

1665
01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 2>and probably most of your listeners do </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>

1666
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
<v Speaker 2>You can have a set of principles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with religion and </v>

1667
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:34.830
<v Speaker 2>which is what waking up is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1668
01:12:34.831 --> 01:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what we're about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1669
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the crazy part of what the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing here,</v>

1670
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:44.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this onslaught against new </v>

1671
01:12:44.601 --> 01:12:46.821
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so against Sam and Richard Dawkins and </v>

1672
01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hitchins even though he's not around</v>

1673
01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1674
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:51.390
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know what new atheists were</v>
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>

1675
01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>So I started asking some people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Kyle said,</v>

1676
01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:58.491
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just an atheist who's </v>

1677
01:12:58.491 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>finally saying I'm here because for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time atheist wouldn't even say that</v>

1678
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:04.851
<v Speaker 2>they were here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you have the far left is the </v>

1679
01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:08.301
<v Speaker 2>ones that are attacking atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it supposed to be the far right </v>

1680
01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:09.750
<v Speaker 2>attacking the people who don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with religion?</v>

1681
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.630
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It is incredibly warm ups and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make any sense whatsoever.</v>

1683
01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And there was a real really recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1684
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.260
<v Speaker 2>have you seen Sam Harris's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1685
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.310
<v Speaker 2>there's something I tweeted a few days </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1686
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on something called secular talk.</v>

1687
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So Kyle is the guy that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1689
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 2>he's the friend that said to me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new atheist thing.</v>

1690
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 2>So they picked up basically where our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation ended because when I did </v>

1691
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.800
<v Speaker 2>that and that.</v>

1692
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna play clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1693
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:36.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1694
01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>But I was going to say that Sam snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He snapped.</v>

1695
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say snap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by his Breton.</v>

1696
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said snapped.</v>

1697
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how he described it too.</v>

1698
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>But he expressed himself about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really going on with these people,</v>

1699
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.200
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Greenwald or I'll let him </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick who it was and what it was.</v>

1700
01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:57.060
<v Speaker 2>But if you listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the thing,</v>

1701
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1702
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 2>the channel on Youtube called secular </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and the title of it is Sam Harris </v>

1703
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:04.530
<v Speaker 2>on progressivism torture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and foreign policy.</v>

1704
01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking fantastic because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant,</v>

1705
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 2>so eloquent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant as well,</v>

1706
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but eloquent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just nails perfectly</v>

1707
01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 3>expressed what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that the inherent problem then?</v>

1708
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Because what I see when I did my sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>down with him,</v>

1709
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.390
<v Speaker 3>I laid it out very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to him,</v>

1710
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:24.391
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take the five things that people </v>

1711
01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:26.191
<v Speaker 3>misquote you about the most and let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it very youtube friendly so that </v>

1712
01:14:26.191 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 3>when these crazy people are screaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>about you,</v>

1713
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 3>anyone on twitter can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a link.</v>

1714
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Give it five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did it and he laid out a,</v>

1715
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the profiling.</v>

1716
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 3>He laid out the nuclear first strike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He laid out all Muslims,</v>

1717
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:37.450
<v Speaker 3>verse Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1718
01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:39.730
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas,</v>

1719
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:41.470
<v Speaker 3>which he did backtrack a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

1720
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about ideas,</v>

1721
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 3>not the slanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1722
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's how we laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we.</v>

1723
01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:50.350
<v Speaker 3>And then we did the whole thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt when I was done with that,</v>

1724
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 3>sit down again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was my first episode of my show.</v>

1725
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with this topic.</v>

1726
01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt I had added a little something to</v>

1727
01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:02.971
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had helped the discourse a little bit </v>

1728
01:15:02.971 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and then suddenly right after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all were worse.</v>

1729
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll have Glenn Reza Jank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all double down.</v>

1730
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glen retweeted a misquote from our </v>

1731
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:17.851
<v Speaker 3>interview that that Sam said it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about Sam mentions profiling </v>

1732
01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 3>and he's talking about Jerry Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about Jerry Seinfeld,</v>

1733
01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:25.051
<v Speaker 3>the comedian Jerry Seinfeld should not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be profiled that this is a guy who </v>

1734
01:15:25.051 --> 01:15:26.410
<v Speaker 3>should be able to walk right through </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a silly use of resources to</v>

1735
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Glen retweet something where they said </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who look like Jerry Seinfeld </v>

1736
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 3>completely not what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1737
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:36.910
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Seinfeld easily could be Arab,</v>

1738
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:39.300
<v Speaker 3>so that's I think one of his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his Syrian.</v>

1739
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a ridiculous thing to say,</v>

1740
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 3>so not look like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1741
01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 3>when Sam does the profiling and he talks</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how he should be profiled based on</v>

1742
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:50.050
<v Speaker 3>his own looks because because he's a.</v>

1743
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.890
<v Speaker 3>he's a middle aged man and if a middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a middle aged white guy,</v>

1744
01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:58.891
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even talking about the race in </v>

1745
01:15:58.891 --> 01:15:58.891
<v Speaker 3>this instance that if me or you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if me and you,</v>

1746
01:15:58.891 --> 01:16:01.930
<v Speaker 3>we're right now going lax that we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be profiled.</v>

1747
01:16:01.931 --> 01:16:05.350
<v Speaker 3>They should look at two guys of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain age and whatever,</v>

1748
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 3>whatever their criteria are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not based on race or religion,</v>

1749
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.100
<v Speaker 3>but there should be some more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1750
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 3>they should look at us in a more curious</v>
<v Speaker 3>way than perhaps an eight year old Dutch</v>

1751
01:16:16.361 --> 01:16:21.361
<v Speaker 3>woman that's in a wheelchair or he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to have smart profiling or what </v>

1752
01:16:21.361 --> 01:16:25.621
<v Speaker 3>he calls anti profiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with profile really is </v>

1753
01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 3>you're getting profiled by people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so fucking dumb.</v>

1754
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 3>They work for the TSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1755
01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>

1756
01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 3>As I read this whole thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>give people,</v>

1757
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 3>like recognizing facial expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1758
01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck outta here.</v>

1759
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever like paused for a minute when </v>

1760
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 3>you're looking for something and been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly on the wall while the TSA agents are</v>

1761
01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:45.650
<v Speaker 3>talking to each other about what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to eat or what this is saying.</v>

1762
01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Any and barely paying any attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just folks work in a job,</v>

1763
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:50.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they are.</v>

1764
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>The folks that got a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1765
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1766
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:57.871
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we really wanted to profile in the </v>

1767
01:16:57.871 --> 01:17:00.400
<v Speaker 3>way that profiling should be done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to do it the way the </v>

1768
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Israelis do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that you're,</v>

1769
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.280
<v Speaker 3>they have cameras on everybody watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>every bit of body language and every bit</v>

1770
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.730
<v Speaker 3>of nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even I went,</v>

1771
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went</v>

1772
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:15.130
<v Speaker 2>to Israel I think in 97 and I to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to go in a separate room and they </v>

1773
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>asked me every question you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly think of.</v>

1774
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Jew from long island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was profiled,</v>

1775
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

1776
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.210
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it out of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

1777
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.170
<v Speaker 2>they just don't want their planes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explode.</v>

1778
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.000
<v Speaker 2>And I had to explain something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>where my bar Mitzvah was.</v>

1779
01:17:30.001 --> 01:17:35.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean really crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure they would prefer </v>

1780
01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 2>not to have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't walk away going,</v>

1781
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profiling like that.</v>

1782
01:17:38.391 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain things that are these.</v>

1783
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.120
<v Speaker 2>This is a very difficult discussion to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have because the social justice warriors</v>

1784
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 2>make it so that even when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this now,</v>

1785
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:51.050
<v Speaker 2>there's this feeling that somehow I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>before profiling,</v>

1786
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they should just be ignored.</v>

1787
01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 2>These so called social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that as times going on,</v>

1788
01:17:56.721 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 2>they're becoming so ridiculous that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're either doing it to themselves.</v>

1789
01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:02.990
<v Speaker 2>There was a great story that I tweeted a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago,</v>

1790
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antifeminist speaker disinvited to </v>

1791
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.530
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable learning in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture series a because she made </v>

1792
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 2>students uncomfortable but don't safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>spaces.</v>

1793
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:19.211
<v Speaker 2>But listen to this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is called uncomfortable </v>

1794
01:18:19.211 --> 01:18:19.940
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is this the lecture series.</v>

1795
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:24.200
<v Speaker 2>And they disinvited her because she made</v>
<v Speaker 2>students uncomfortable.</v>

1796
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking madness.</v>

1797
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what we're talking about</v>

1798
01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:30.080
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1799
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 2>think how dangerous it is to do this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college kid more than anything else.</v>

1800
01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Because first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dragging the kids,</v>

1801
01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:37.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>

1802
01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:41.690
<v Speaker 2>we know that they're all on Ritalin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit right there on all that.</v>

1803
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Now they go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the ones that aren't on that,</v>

1804
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you if they go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college is supposed to be where you </v>

1805
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.581
<v Speaker 2>figure out what your sort of base ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>are before you go out into the real </v>

1806
01:18:51.581 --> 01:18:51.581
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1807
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1808
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 2>the college is Brandeis University </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced Ayaan Hirsi Ali.</v>

1809
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I have heard on my show next week like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go into that.</v>

1810
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insanity.</v>

1811
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perverse at the highest.</v>

1812
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:10.930
<v Speaker 2>What is their dispute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think the argument was that </v>

1813
01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:12.410
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't like Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was raised in.</v>

1814
01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:17.411
<v Speaker 2>It almost killed her coworker van Gogh's</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandson or whatever was killed on the </v>

1815
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:22.451
<v Speaker 2>street in Holland for cartoon and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about ideas again and this is </v>

1816
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:24.920
<v Speaker 2>what Sam says all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to talk about ideas,</v>

1817
01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:30.190
<v Speaker 2>not people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other set of ideas would we be </v>

1818
01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:31.460
<v Speaker 2>afraid to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on in universities though?</v>

1819
01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Is it the students that are dictating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the policy by,</v>

1820
01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 2>by protesting and is it the professors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1821
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's coming from the professors </v>
<v Speaker 2>partly for what you said before about </v>

1822
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 2>athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's this idea if you want to be</v>

1823
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:48.491
<v Speaker 2>a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of in Gad said talks about this a </v>

1824
01:19:48.491 --> 01:19:50.741
<v Speaker 2>lot because he is a college professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know he's had his struggles as </v>

1825
01:19:50.741 --> 01:19:50.930
<v Speaker 2>someone that is outing this bullshit.</v>

1826
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I think he's had his professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles.</v>

1827
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I think in our interview he talked a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about some exchanges he's had</v>

1828
01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:01.990
<v Speaker 2>with other professors where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to touch some of his ideas because </v>

1829
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that he's talking about anything </v>

1830
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>really controversial at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1831
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's because of the professor of the</v>

1832
01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 2>PR pressure from the students or is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming first?</v>

1833
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's coming first from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors or or even whatever is above </v>

1834
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.891
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the </v>

1835
01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:18.891
<v Speaker 2>administration's or even whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 2>above that.</v>

1836
01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:18.891
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know how high you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go with it,</v>

1837
01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's the kids that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1838
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:24.741
<v Speaker 2>I think they are being fed shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being fed fear and stupidity and</v>

1839
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:27.230
<v Speaker 2>then they just bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1840
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.840
<v Speaker 2>they just sort of rally around is also a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem in colleges.</v>

1841
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe that these people that operate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in academia,</v>

1842
01:20:34.021 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>I've only worked in Ghana and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand the real world because</v>

1843
01:20:38.191 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 2>they aren't in it and they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of power with young people,</v>

1844
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 2>so their ideas have incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

1845
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 2>They're standing on this stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teat teaching these lectures,</v>

1846
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:50.790
<v Speaker 2>teaching these classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have these young impressionable</v>

1847
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:53.880
<v Speaker 2>people that are listening to them just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them a gigantic ego boost.</v>

1848
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 2>They have this platform and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never competed in the real world.</v>

1849
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.930
<v Speaker 2>They've never contributed to the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world other than teaching children.</v>

1850
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of them like that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have gone through the educational system</v>

1851
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:10.010
<v Speaker 2>and then gone from the educational </v>
<v Speaker 2>system directly to teaching and then </v>

1852
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:13.690
<v Speaker 2>this is their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is their universe and this is how </v>

1853
01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:14.700
<v Speaker 2>they exist and these people are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much all part of the regressive left.</v>

1854
01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 2>They are pretty much all parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you could think,</v>

1855
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:20.340
<v Speaker 2>here's a simple example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a difference between debating</v>

1856
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:25.341
<v Speaker 2>ideas and hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say somebody that that hated </v>

1857
01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:29.241
<v Speaker 2>Muslim people want it to speak at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>college and it was going to talk about </v>

1858
01:21:29.241 --> 01:21:33.351
<v Speaker 2>how we should kick them out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country or we should whatever horrible </v>

1859
01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:38.090
<v Speaker 2>things to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see absolutely protest that </v>

1860
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:41.061
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use Your right of free speech and free </v>

1861
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 2>assembly to protest that person's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should the college not let them come.</v>

1862
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was purely hate,</v>

1863
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know that that's a really slippery</v>

1864
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:51.330
<v Speaker 2>slope because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 2>versus you could take any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people ion Hirsi Ali,</v>

1866
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.940
<v Speaker 2>she's not against Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's against the doctrine,</v>

1867
01:21:59.941 --> 01:22:04.941
<v Speaker 2>these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we can't make the distinction </v>

1868
01:22:04.941 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 2>between hate speech and someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to debate ideas,</v>

1869
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>if you can't do that in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then where the hell else can you?</v>

1870
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try getting some inflammatory quotes by </v>

1871
01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Ian Hirsi Ali that you could argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that aren't live really well </v>

1872
01:22:20.341 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 2>thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't articulate,</v>

1873
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that aren't based on her personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences growing up in this religion.</v>

1874
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Her understanding of the scripture like </v>
<v Speaker 2>try,</v>

1875
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
<v Speaker 2>try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try finding some ignorant Hayden that </v>

1876
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys don't want to debate ideas.</v>

1877
01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It's really as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the very personal level I can tell</v>

1878
01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've had Janken.</v>

1879
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:42.420
<v Speaker 2>He was my former boss for two years at </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyt.</v>

1880
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:48.230
<v Speaker 2>He watched the original thing with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sat down with him for three </v>

1881
01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:49.950
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see any of that shit?</v>

1882
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I watched the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hours.</v>

1883
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I watched that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working for him at the time.</v>

1884
01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Literally like my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like this the entire time because </v>

1885
01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I was having a headache because I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>not believe that this person that I </v>

1886
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.500
<v Speaker 2>worked for who I respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I play basketball with every Sunday,</v>

1887
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.500
<v Speaker 2>that he was so dense to the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam was portraying.</v>

1888
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as I said to you before that at the</v>

1889
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.660
<v Speaker 2>end of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had made this conversation a</v>

1890
01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:21.661
<v Speaker 2>little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jank only doubled down on all of this </v>

1891
01:23:21.661 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 2>shit because they don't want to debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

1892
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.600
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want Sam to be discredited so </v>

1893
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.841
<v Speaker 2>that their ideas when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have to fight against </v>

1894
01:23:30.841 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if sam disappears,</v>

1895
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 2>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Sam disappears tomorrow,</v>

1896
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:38.041
<v Speaker 2>it's not about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about all the ideas that will all </v>

1897
01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>be afraid to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Charlie Hebdo cartoons,</v>

1898
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.200
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family guy can do whatever the fuck they</v>

1899
01:23:41.201 --> 01:23:42.220
<v Speaker 2>want on Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1900
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Every episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1901
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an episode where Jesus is </v>

1902
01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.070
<v Speaker 2>bathing with porn music in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background in front of [inaudible] a </v>

1903
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.070
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had a problem with that.</v>

1904
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Try doing that with Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we can't have,</v>

1905
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 2>we can't just pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pick,</v>

1906
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.990
<v Speaker 2>say whatever the fuck you want about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism.</v>

1907
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Big Goddamn deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it with Cenk?</v>

1908
01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 2>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1909
01:23:59.471 --> 01:24:00.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1910
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1911
01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:05.580
<v Speaker 2>that was really perplexing to me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually feel like you were there are </v>

1912
01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 2>agree with him or don't agree with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>on other things.</v>

1913
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1914
01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:10.030
<v Speaker 2>he's got an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks about it,</v>

1915
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 2>he talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tries to be open minded,</v>

1916
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:17.851
<v Speaker 2>he's passionate about these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with that it was so confusing to me </v>

1917
01:24:17.851 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 2>because it was almost like he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to win,</v>

1918
01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:24.250
<v Speaker 2>look like he was trying to find a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat someone who is,</v>

1919
01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samson intellectual black belt,</v>

1920
01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>like a high level world champion black </v>
<v Speaker 2>belts of the spoken word.</v>

1921
01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:37.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that Jank it's not at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same level of Sam when they come when it</v>

1922
01:24:37.691 --> 01:24:42.691
<v Speaker 2>comes to debating these ideas at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point about 20 minutes in Sam does lays </v>

1923
01:24:42.691 --> 01:24:47.341
<v Speaker 2>out some basic probability stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yanked your says he doesn't believe in </v>

1924
01:24:47.341 --> 01:24:47.341
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1925
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of explains it right there.</v>

1926
01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Like Sam wasn't laying out a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just saying this is sorta how </v>

1927
01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:55.111
<v Speaker 2>probability works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jack was like,</v>

1928
01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:55.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1929
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:55.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1930
01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in it.</v>

1931
01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just for the record,</v>

1932
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I get no pleasure even talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because you know,</v>

1933
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like.</v>

1934
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you debate Cenk or having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with him off the air?</v>

1935
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't because it just,</v>

1936
01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.610
<v Speaker 2>it just never materialized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1937
01:25:12.611 --> 01:25:17.611
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I did do the main young Turk </v>

1938
01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:17.611
<v Speaker 2>show with him a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time because I was on it,</v>

1939
01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:22.541
<v Speaker 2>it was because he was out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was either filling in or something </v>

1940
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:25.171
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there wasn't really the forum for </v>

1941
01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:25.171
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1942
01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 2>and then it really had a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>why I left because I just could not </v>

1943
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 2>believe it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1944
01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.320
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have edited things </v>
<v Speaker 2>where Jake says one thing directly to </v>

1945
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Sam's face and then days later is saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complete reverse thing.</v>

1946
01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Sitting down with Reza Aslan and saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1947
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he means all Muslims.</v>

1948
01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>

1949
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:47.620
<v Speaker 2>You just said to his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just said to his face that,</v>

1950
01:25:47.621 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what he says and I think it's</v>

1951
01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:55.561
<v Speaker 2>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes to that AFLAC thing that he's </v>

1952
01:25:55.561 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 2>trying to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to defend Muslim people that</v>

1953
01:25:57.071 --> 01:26:02.071
<v Speaker 2>he feels are being abused and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lofty goal there </v>

1954
01:26:02.071 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you use the tactics of dishonesty</v>

1955
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 3>and slander and smearing and all that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get there,</v>

1956
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:09.680
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

1957
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>

1958
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.680
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I really liked him.</v>

1959
01:26:13.681 --> 01:26:15.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what fucks me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1960
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.640
<v Speaker 3>I feel completely the same way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I am.</v>

1961
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:21.920
<v Speaker 3>So when I left I just left the thing be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1962
01:26:21.921 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1963
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:23.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left,</v>

1964
01:26:23.061 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 3>we left on good terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went out to breakfast,</v>

1965
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 3>we were good to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he just kept on twitter,</v>

1966
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:33.550
<v Speaker 3>kept lying about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresenting ideas and people and </v>

1967
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 3>tons of his own fans were turning on </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1968
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 3>So I just finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after months I was like,</v>

1969
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't take this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to do something.</v>

1970
01:26:38.481 --> 01:26:43.481
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do because you </v>

1971
01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:43.481
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1972
01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:43.481
<v Speaker 3>it's like here's a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a coworker,</v>

1973
01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:48.401
<v Speaker 3>a contemporary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how do I do this in a respectful </v>

1974
01:26:48.401 --> 01:26:48.401
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

1975
01:26:48.401 --> 01:26:50.090
<v Speaker 3>And finally one night I laid out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight or 10 tweets in a row.</v>

1976
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I thought them all through first and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1977
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:56.981
<v Speaker 3>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I think is going on because </v>

1978
01:26:56.981 --> 01:26:56.981
<v Speaker 3>I needed it to be public because if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had just sent them an email,</v>

1979
01:26:56.981 --> 01:26:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:02.500
<v Speaker 3>he could either not respond to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does that do at the end of the </v>

1981
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:02.660
<v Speaker 3>day if me and him get to our mayor </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kulpa,</v>

1982
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's not public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1983
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.460
<v Speaker 3>So in a very respectful and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking me,</v>

1984
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I laid out some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He completely ignored it.</v>

1985
01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:14.690
<v Speaker 3>A couple of weeks went by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finally I did something and finally he </v>

1986
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 3>responded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then just kept doing the same shit.</v>

1987
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:19.370
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what the answer is but </v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1988
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 3>But this is what Glenn is done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what Rez is done.</v>

1989
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked.</v>

1990
01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:27.470
<v Speaker 3>These are tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are tactics they're using to win.</v>

1991
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Marginalized was right on my show who </v>
<v Speaker 3>cowrote sandblast book,</v>

1992
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:35.441
<v Speaker 3>it was a discussion about Islam called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future of tolerance Islam in the </v>

1993
01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:38.621
<v Speaker 3>future of tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm pretty sure these are people on </v>

1994
01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:38.621
<v Speaker 3>the side of tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1995
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Majid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who by the way has been treated worse </v>

1996
01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:43.630
<v Speaker 3>than anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:43.660
<v Speaker 3>like one of these guys that works at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1998
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intercept for Glen called a Mojito </v>

1999
01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.280
<v Speaker 3>porch monkey while he was sitting next </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Sam.</v>

2000
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:50.540
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2001
01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:51.230
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2002
01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:56.231
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe what we think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to believe as a Muslim person </v>

2003
01:27:56.231 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Speaker 3>and you're with an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're his porch monkey.</v>

2004
01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think if that came from the right,</v>

2005
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:04.631
<v Speaker 3>how we would rightly react,</v>
<v Speaker 3>react to that or how these guys on the </v>

2006
01:28:04.631 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 3>left you would react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2007
01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.090
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2008
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:08.300
<v Speaker 3>so sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what leaves me with such like</v>

2009
01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:12.050
<v Speaker 3>conflict here is that I don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to stop.</v>

2010
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think they've learned,</v>

2011
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that Hitler quote?</v>

2012
01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the lie,</v>

2013
01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:22.181
<v Speaker 3>the more people will believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're partly operating on </v>

2014
01:28:22.181 --> 01:28:22.700
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the opportunity cost for Sam,</v>

2015
01:28:22.701 --> 01:28:23.600
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

2016
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:28.601
<v Speaker 3>for anyone that cares about any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to clean up the mess is is way too much </v>

2017
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.320
<v Speaker 3>for just up Sam's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that's easy,</v>

2018
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:38.410
<v Speaker 3>but now same to clean it up and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a two hour frustrated </v>

2019
01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:38.690
<v Speaker 3>conversation that he had and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

2020
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.480
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to it fucking brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

2021
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.560
<v Speaker 4>It was a two hour conversation that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to balance out x amount of months</v>

2022
01:28:47.171 --> 01:28:52.171
<v Speaker 4>of disinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that ultimately in the long </v>

2023
01:28:52.171 --> 01:28:55.501
<v Speaker 4>run his ideas are more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're more like what he's saying is </v>

2024
01:28:56.351 --> 01:29:00.700
<v Speaker 4>well thought through and his opinions </v>
<v Speaker 4>are better considered.</v>

2025
01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I when you</v>

2026
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:06.510
<v Speaker 2>cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot made it through one with you.</v>

2027
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 2>What with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2028
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:10.050
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't at one and it looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one to the point that I,</v>

2029
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.080
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a tipping point coming </v>

2030
01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>because I do think our site is getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>

2031
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:20.091
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the amount of effort and energy he </v>

2032
01:29:20.091 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 2>has had to put into this and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

2033
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a chilling effect when they,</v>

2034
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.490
<v Speaker 2>when people see the ad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about us.</v>

2035
01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>When the average person sees what has </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to this guy again,</v>

2036
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you've sat with him for probably 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

2037
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:37.670
<v Speaker 2>never thought he was a racist before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the average person sees what </v>

2038
01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 2>they've done to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it causes the average person not to want</v>

2039
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:41.280
<v Speaker 2>to speak about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get emails.</v>

2040
01:29:41.281 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an email a couple of days ago from</v>

2041
01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 2>someone in Sweden saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am terrified to talk about any of this</v>

2042
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:46.890
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2043
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified to talk about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in my country right now.</v>

2044
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2045
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>and I'm getting emails from all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally all way from Saudi Arabia and </v>

2046
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People saying you're talking about stuff</v>

2047
01:29:56.881 --> 01:30:01.881
<v Speaker 2>that people are afraid to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it for any other reason </v>

2048
01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:01.881
<v Speaker 2>other than I feel like I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2049
01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:06.861
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like I'm on this road </v>

2050
01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:06.861
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just appeared before me.</v>

2051
01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:07.620
<v Speaker 2>If this wasn't where I really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2052
01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:11.970
<v Speaker 2>my standard was a lot about transformers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gi Joe.</v>

2053
01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Stupid Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2054
01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either,</v>

2056
01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:23.751
<v Speaker 2>but I think that when guys like Jank do </v>
<v Speaker 2>say things that are easily discredited.</v>

2057
01:30:24.361 --> 01:30:25.830
<v Speaker 2>When you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2058
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:29.130
<v Speaker 2>you said this one thing two days ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking to Sam,</v>

2059
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.770
<v Speaker 2>now you're saying something completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different when he's not here.</v>

2060
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:37.250
<v Speaker 2>That is so bad for people's perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your ideas.</v>

2061
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad for your own credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad when you express opinions </v>

2062
01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 2>about other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can say something like,</v>

2063
01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 2>as a comic you can say things and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can joke around them and I can know that</v>

2064
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you're joking so I can I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2065
01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.470
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really believe that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking around,</v>

2066
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 2>but that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't fucking around.</v>

2067
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So you're being held to your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ideas.</v>

2068
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You're held accountable for your ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when your ideas are massively </v>

2069
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.921
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent and contrary days later and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are expressing an idea that you</v>

2070
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:16.550
<v Speaker 2>have to know is incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the part that I don't </v>

2071
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:17.400
<v Speaker 2>understand because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have fucked up,</v>

2072
01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 2>we've all done fucked up things in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2073
01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>We've all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all lied,</v>

2074
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 2>we've all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I have.</v>

2075
01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you,</v>

2076
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>

2077
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

2078
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:29.000
<v Speaker 2>we've asked yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all made mistakes.</v>

2079
01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2080
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Brian Williams made some stupid part ego</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>

2081
01:31:34.771 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it.</v>

2082
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 2>A and then only found like 15 different </v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything being equal,</v>

2083
01:31:41.161 --> 01:31:45.930
<v Speaker 2>they weren't like cataclysmic lies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scheme of what,</v>

2084
01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:50.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean in the scheme of </v>

2085
01:31:50.931 --> 01:31:52.041
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were about his little adventures </v>

2086
01:31:52.041 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 2>that he exaggerated partly because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media because the media wants you to</v>

2087
01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:57.291
<v Speaker 2>be a star two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has to go on the tonight show and </v>

2088
01:31:57.291 --> 01:31:57.291
<v Speaker 2>talk about being on a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went actually,</v>

2089
01:31:57.291 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 2>would Walter Cronkite have done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

2090
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2091
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I've got a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Reynolds easy and I think,</v>

2092
01:32:03.641 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his story,</v>

2093
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the nine slash 11 story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2094
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.100
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're really similar.</v>

2095
01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 1>The Brian Williams thing and that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>both original stories.</v>

2096
01:32:11.711 --> 01:32:16.711
<v Speaker 1>We're actually pretty impressive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys doctored them up and turned </v>

2097
01:32:16.711 --> 01:32:20.541
<v Speaker 1>them into this epic thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately cost them a shitload of </v>

2098
01:32:20.541 --> 01:32:25.261
<v Speaker 1>credibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not all their credibility with Brian </v>

2099
01:32:25.261 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actually in a fucking helicopter </v>

2100
01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The helicopter in front of them was shot</v>

2101
01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:28.750
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2102
01:32:28.751 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>that's scary as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a reporter,</v>

2103
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you're getting shot at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing gunshots.</v>

2104
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Go off the people in front of you or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

2105
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:41.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your helicopter had to get hit though </v>

2106
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:44.791
<v Speaker 1>because ultimately these people are full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit and they have to exaggerate and,</v>

2107
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and jazz it up.</v>

2108
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:48.760
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

2109
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust what they're saying.</v>

2110
01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that,</v>

2111
01:32:51.901 --> 01:32:54.870
<v Speaker 1>then it has that effect where you go at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy did this one.</v>

2112
01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>

2113
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Actually my point was actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse of that because what I was going</v>

2114
01:32:58.791 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>to say is that his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lies were little additional details,</v>

2115
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little.</v>

2116
01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:09.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little cooler details what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys have done have been too blatantly </v>

2117
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:10.230
<v Speaker 1>distort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Someone's views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talked to you about opponent.</v>

2119
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:14.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2120
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a competition between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins,</v>

2121
01:33:16.661 --> 01:33:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2122
01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do with that?</v>

2123
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 1>So what do I can't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2124
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:26.041
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like junk but I'm not turning to him </v>

2125
01:33:26.041 --> 01:33:26.041
<v Speaker 1>for advice or ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't.</v>

2126
01:33:26.041 --> 01:33:30.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how I listened to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I listened to his opinions about </v>

2127
01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:33.961
<v Speaker 1>things I unfortunately have to take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration that has been massively </v>

2128
01:33:33.961 --> 01:33:34.900
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent about this one thing.</v>

2129
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone is caught or exposure,</v>

2130
01:33:38.171 --> 01:33:43.171
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have so severely misrepresented </v>

2131
01:33:43.171 --> 01:33:46.351
<v Speaker 1>someone else's views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how were you able to separate that from </v>

2132
01:33:46.351 --> 01:33:46.351
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest?</v>

2133
01:33:46.351 --> 01:33:49.921
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you like 80 percent of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>views or anybody would have to make it </v>

2134
01:33:49.921 --> 01:33:49.921
<v Speaker 1>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2135
01:33:49.921 --> 01:33:51.250
<v Speaker 1>how do you separate that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

2136
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:56.251
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I do it at all and I </v>

2137
01:33:56.251 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 1>know Sam has said that about Glen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when it comes to the,</v>

2138
01:33:56.741 --> 01:33:58.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NSA stuff,</v>

2139
01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:03.990
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of that now </v>

2140
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:03.990
<v Speaker 1>because I know what this person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>

2141
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2142
01:34:04.901 --> 01:34:09.901
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting point and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important point because I have </v>

2143
01:34:09.901 --> 01:34:13.051
<v Speaker 1>people on this podcast all the time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with and I want to hear </v>

2144
01:34:13.051 --> 01:34:13.051
<v Speaker 1>their thoughts.</v>

2145
01:34:13.051 --> 01:34:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with Mark Marin </v>

2146
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:17.250
<v Speaker 1>the other night at the comedy store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2147
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>why'd you have that guy on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that guys have this,</v>

2148
01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:21.040
<v Speaker 1>and then he said that because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what makes them tick.</v>

2149
01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to find out what goes on his head</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes on in his head,</v>

2150
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference between someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with and someone who I </v>

2151
01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 1>know is distorting that use of another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2152
01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:36.660
<v Speaker 1>like changing someone's words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing someone's intent and and doing </v>

2153
01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:41.821
<v Speaker 1>it for their own benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it so that they can win this </v>

2154
01:34:41.821 --> 01:34:44.671
<v Speaker 1>ideological conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this argument that that becomes a real </v>

2155
01:34:44.671 --> 01:34:45.380
<v Speaker 1>issue and there also becomes a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

2156
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Like what if I having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and then two weeks later you </v>

2157
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 1>distort what I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2158
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

2159
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to defend my ideas </v>

2160
01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:57.020
<v Speaker 1>because you've mislabeled them or ms.ms</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot,</v>

2161
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misconstrued.</v>

2162
01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

2163
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It's also what is so cool about being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the digital space because as I said,</v>

2164
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 1>people are first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are clipping things.</v>

2165
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You can clip on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you did,</v>

2166
01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>here's what you did and they can explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

2167
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:14.890
<v Speaker 1>so first off you've empowered the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of this that are just </v>

2168
01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 1>consuming it are now able to get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices heard,</v>

2169
01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:21.701
<v Speaker 1>to fight the bullshit and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been a real wave with that </v>

2170
01:35:21.701 --> 01:35:25.181
<v Speaker 1>which is incredibly inspiring to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so different than ever before and </v>

2171
01:35:25.181 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if someone came on here.</v>

2172
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:30.641
<v Speaker 1>If I come on here and I said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was profoundly dishonest or was </v>

2173
01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:32.050
<v Speaker 1>smearing of someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never hear the end of it and and</v>

2174
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:37.060
<v Speaker 1>hopefully people would tag you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and you retweet the shit out of </v>

2175
01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it until everybody had seen.</v>

2176
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You see what fucking Rubin did and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2177
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm pretty sure that's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not the end of this,</v>

2178
01:35:41.871 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 1>but when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't benefit.</v>

2179
01:35:43.401 --> 01:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't benefit because you can be.</v>

2180
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't understand about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

2181
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 1>How can you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you retweet memes?</v>

2182
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Implying that Sam wants to a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire Middle East.</v>

2183
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:59.261
<v Speaker 1>When you first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know his whole thing on nuking the </v>

2184
01:35:59.261 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 1>first right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the end of end of faith.</v>

2185
01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's about a page and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much time he spent on this </v>

2186
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:09.431
<v Speaker 1>topic and they've made it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is his bucket and go to his </v>

2187
01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:12.581
<v Speaker 1>position and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about a horrific scenario </v>

2188
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:17.300
<v Speaker 1>or some isis type civilization has </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of nuclear weapons and there's a</v>

2189
01:36:17.301 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Speaker 1>real threat that they're going to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on other people.</v>

2190
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:20.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's talking about.</v>

2191
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Apocalyptic regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked what he's talking.</v>

2192
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:26.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's possibility,</v>

2193
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:31.170
<v Speaker 1>if it's a possibility that there could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a regime like that somewhere in the </v>

2194
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:31.170
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to say,</v>

2195
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:31.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would we do?</v>

2196
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:36.430
<v Speaker 1>What are the options?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could you do in that scenario to </v>

2197
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:39.560
<v Speaker 1>not debate that is to like dig your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sand and that's.</v>

2198
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the bigger problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Barack Obama thinks on</v>

2199
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:43.370
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have nukes right now.</v>

2200
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:46.010
<v Speaker 1>We know we have new because we're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only country that's used nukes.</v>

2201
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Barack Obama would </v>
<v Speaker 1>only wait until we were nuked to use </v>

2202
01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 1>nukes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

2203
01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2204
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much discussion there.</v>

2205
01:36:57.170 --> 01:37:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a discussion there and I think </v>

2206
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the deal.</v>

2207
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:05.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like a discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you discredit people would </v>

2208
01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:06.530
<v Speaker 1>be dishonest statements.</v>

2209
01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 1>When you say things that you know are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not true,</v>

2210
01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:14.810
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not not like what you're talking about.</v>

2211
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.190
<v Speaker 1>When you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2212
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure no one's gonna find </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory statements by me.</v>

2213
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because there's no benefit in it.</v>

2214
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you like is not going to really </v>

2215
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 1>gain points by distorting Sam's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives on things.</v>

2216
01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.840
<v Speaker 1>He is only going to gain points with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't actually know Sam's </v>

2217
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.340
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to lose massively when people</v>

2218
01:37:37.341 --> 01:37:39.570
<v Speaker 1>do listen to what Sam says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:44.710
<v Speaker 1>because then you all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever goodwill and whatever,</v>

2220
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.080
<v Speaker 1>love and appreciation for your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to go out the window when </v>

2221
01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 1>they find out that your ideas have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted,</v>

2222
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that your your points of view rather of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's ideas.</v>

2223
01:37:56.671 --> 01:37:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I've been distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:37:57.781 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I've had that happen to me on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I show with a guy that I actually like.</v>

2225
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Even though he did this sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein and ancillary.</v>

2226
01:38:07.551 --> 01:38:09.640
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a social justice warrior.</v>

2227
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's a bad guy.</v>

2228
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like them as human being.</v>

2229
01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I talked to him,</v>

2230
01:38:14.611 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy talking to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did a podcast to get together and</v>

2231
01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:22.551
<v Speaker 1>we disagreed on a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he went on his podcast and </v>

2232
01:38:22.551 --> 01:38:25.950
<v Speaker 1>completely distorted everything that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said and changed the entire conversation</v>

2233
01:38:25.951 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>to him being a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2234
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>which is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2235
01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:29.580
<v Speaker 1>one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2236
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
<v Speaker 1>and then this guy online put together </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual conversation and Jamie's </v>

2237
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 1>perception of the conversation and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it was,</v>

2238
01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I forget the Kilstein delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the name of the video and because</v>

2239
01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:48.321
<v Speaker 1>of that he received so much fucking hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that made him aware of that </v>

2240
01:38:48.321 --> 01:38:52.881
<v Speaker 1>and he said it was the low moment of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and he completely good stop doing </v>

2241
01:38:52.881 --> 01:38:54.860
<v Speaker 1>that and he doesn't do any of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and you know,</v>

2242
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:57.480
<v Speaker 1>he's rebounded and now he's happier than</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ever been before.</v>

2243
01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that type of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not to standard.</v>

2244
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost expected,</v>

2245
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what they do and that's if </v>

2246
01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of that victim culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perpetual victim culture,</v>

2247
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:11.150
<v Speaker 1>that's how you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2248
01:39:11.151 --> 01:39:16.151
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it seem like people were </v>

2249
01:39:16.151 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 1>yelling at you and there's people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were so upset with me and all I was</v>

2250
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:18.120
<v Speaker 1>doing was trying to say that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be raped.</v>

2251
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not what happened.</v>

2252
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 1>That must've been incredibly validating </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2253
01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like because it,</v>

2254
01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:29.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's personal too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's why you can see my body </v>

2255
01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.440
<v Speaker 1>language probably when I talk about Jake</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

2256
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I get no pleasure out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not how I see.</v>

2257
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to work for this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with so much of,</v>

2258
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get money out of politics.</v>

2259
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2260
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:44.360
<v Speaker 1>his core stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go there for my feelings </v>

2261
01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 1>ultimately to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's where we're at.</v>

2262
01:39:46.141 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 1>So in a case like you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jamie,</v>

2263
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely validating that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a space based on a certain amount</v>

2264
01:39:51.631 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 1>of principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone goes against them,</v>

2265
01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:58.761
<v Speaker 1>your audience then calls them out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's like a teachable moment to </v>

2266
01:39:58.761 --> 01:39:58.761
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good,</v>

2267
01:39:58.761 --> 01:40:00.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in that way it's great.</v>

2268
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:05.691
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take any pleasure in the fact </v>

2269
01:40:05.691 --> 01:40:08.271
<v Speaker 1>that he got fucked up emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it or not that the hate that </v>

2270
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:13.701
<v Speaker 1>you get online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're like a super </v>

2271
01:40:13.701 --> 01:40:13.860
<v Speaker 1>sensitive person that's really trolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>for love.</v>

2272
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.880
<v Speaker 1>You know all your fucking lines in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and you're trolling for love.</v>

2273
01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in saying that,</v>

2274
01:40:19.801 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 1>and even becoming this victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trolling for love.</v>

2275
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2276
01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get people to fuck Joe Rogan.</v>

2277
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transphobic,</v>

2278
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

2279
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:30.150
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic,</v>

2280
01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:32.020
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like throw them all out there,</v>

2281
01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 1>throw them all out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2282
01:40:33.841 --> 01:40:36.560
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on when someone's.</v>

2283
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And you got to realize that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>distort people's perceptions or distort </v>

2284
01:40:41.941 --> 01:40:44.730
<v Speaker 1>people's positions for your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

2285
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you do yourself a horrible disservice </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you now have ruined any </v>

2286
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.770
<v Speaker 1>validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2287
01:40:51.771 --> 01:40:56.771
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you have in the past that </v>

2288
01:40:56.771 --> 01:40:58.741
<v Speaker 1>may resonate with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've ruined that because now you've </v>

2289
01:40:58.741 --> 01:40:58.741
<v Speaker 1>poisoned that well.</v>

2290
01:40:58.741 --> 01:41:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it can be so laid out clearly like </v>

2291
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.281
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that two of the five things </v>

2292
01:41:05.281 --> 01:41:05.281
<v Speaker 3>that Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2293
01:41:05.281 --> 01:41:06.610
<v Speaker 3>those controversial things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the profiling thing,</v>

2294
01:41:06.611 --> 01:41:08.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2295
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 3>or we belaboring this point because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's so there's so much to it.</v>

2296
01:41:12.521 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2297
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's say Sam would argue that </v>

2298
01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.410
<v Speaker 3>because these are debatable ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should debate them.</v>

2299
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:23.300
<v Speaker 3>So imagine if subsequently so they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>the three hours,</v>

2300
01:41:23.301 --> 01:41:28.301
<v Speaker 3>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he and Jane and after that instead of </v>

2301
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:28.301
<v Speaker 3>saying he wants to profile Muslim Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ba and Ba,</v>

2302
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:30.580
<v Speaker 3>ba Ba and all that bravado and bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever.</v>

2303
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I imagine if he had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2304
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:36.811
<v Speaker 3>Sam and I really disagree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fear that Sam's use of anti profiling,</v>

2305
01:41:38.321 --> 01:41:39.820
<v Speaker 3>we're profiling whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it.</v>

2306
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I fear that ultimately it will lead if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know for,</v>

2307
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:48.500
<v Speaker 3>for good and you know the road to hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>is paved with good intentions.</v>

2308
01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I think that he's trying to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

2309
01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately it's going to lead to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim people feeling persecuted,</v>

2310
01:41:55.031 --> 01:42:00.031
<v Speaker 3>feeling like the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he had laid that out like that </v>

2311
01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:03.990
<v Speaker 3>and had an intellectually honest say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we believe different things here and </v>

2312
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:07.300
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a pretty great place to be.</v>

2313
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a pretty fucking great place to</v>

2314
01:42:09.281 --> 01:42:14.281
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who who prayer pretty much agree </v>

2315
01:42:14.281 --> 01:42:14.320
<v Speaker 3>on most things and that we can move </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward and go,</v>

2316
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:16.960
<v Speaker 3>we disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you do what he did,</v>

2317
01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:17.880
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've just,</v>

2318
01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.320
<v Speaker 3>you've ransacked the playing field and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and now you just have burned </v>

2319
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.291
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and that's what it's become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why when you mentioned Kyle's </v>

2320
01:42:28.291 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why Sam,</v>

2321
01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.200
<v Speaker 3>that's as frustrated as I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2322
01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:36.210
<v Speaker 3>but as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was still pretty eloquent and pretty </v>

2323
01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:36.210
<v Speaker 3>elegant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's pissed.</v>

2324
01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 3>He's pissed and I think rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

2325
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:40.960
<v Speaker 3>that's why I've been so defensive over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy because I know it's like,</v>

2326
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:43.540
<v Speaker 3>let's have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can do this now.</v>

2327
01:42:43.541 --> 01:42:44.620
<v Speaker 3>It's only gonna get worse.</v>

2328
01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been very defensive with </v>

2329
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:49.780
<v Speaker 1>them as well and unfortunately I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good friend,</v>

2330
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Abby Martin that I love dearly as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she and Sam have gone back and forth</v>

2331
01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:59.030
<v Speaker 1>about this and I think she in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorts his perceptions.</v>

2332
01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

2333
01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I've seen her story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her that well,</v>

2334
01:43:02.091 --> 01:43:03.860
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>

2335
01:43:03.861 --> 01:43:04.950
<v Speaker 1>She's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen her,</v>

2336
01:43:04.951 --> 01:43:07.060
<v Speaker 1>the stored a lot of facts on air to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2337
01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>about different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She gets very passionate and I think </v>

2338
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes she misses the mark on certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2339
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but she's a very good person and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's ultimately,</v>

2340
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:20.590
<v Speaker 1>she has all the right intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the intention is to have the pay the</v>

2341
01:43:21.171 --> 01:43:23.570
<v Speaker 1>road to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking things.</v>

2342
01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>You see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That yes it is.</v>

2343
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like with a guy like Genco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's his own worst enemy in that</v>

2344
01:43:30.741 --> 01:43:33.800
<v Speaker 1>regard because once you start doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2345
01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:38.801
<v Speaker 1>then you have to sort of double down </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to try to figure out a more </v>

2346
01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:40.940
<v Speaker 1>eloquent way of reestablishing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position and when you do that,</v>

2347
01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:42.590
<v Speaker 1>like people don't take you seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2348
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:44.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>

2349
01:43:44.181 --> 01:43:45.080
<v Speaker 1>You become your own enemy.</v>

2350
01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You throw out that bomb of bullshit and </v>

2351
01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:50.280
<v Speaker 3>now you're not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a point,</v>

2352
01:43:50.281 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>there is time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2353
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.630
<v Speaker 2>if you said something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely untrue or,</v>

2354
01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.290
<v Speaker 2>or you smeared somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2355
01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 2>and then two weeks later you thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

2356
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you knew you were lying when you</v>

2357
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two weeks later you're like,</v>

2358
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really shouldn't have done that.</v>

2359
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I intended to do something good </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2360
01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You could backtrack with the value that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have in your name and your fans.</v>

2361
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 2>They would follow you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:44:14.661 --> 01:44:15.960
<v Speaker 2>A couple of people will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck him,</v>

2363
01:44:15.961 --> 01:44:20.961
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people would go and if you calmly </v>

2364
01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:20.961
<v Speaker 2>explained what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

2365
01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:24.850
<v Speaker 2>The problem with these guys is they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone and they kept going and kept going </v>

2366
01:44:24.850 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 2>and kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're so off the range now.</v>

2367
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:30.430
<v Speaker 2>In my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing they could do to ever </v>

2368
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.430
<v Speaker 2>fix this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a guy,</v>

2369
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I know where I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really don't,</v>

2370
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:33.970
<v Speaker 2>and then you just keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where you're going.</v>

2371
01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Your last further and further in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>

2372
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2373
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:41.621
<v Speaker 2>you're so far from the fucking road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going to have to shoot </v>

2374
01:44:41.621 --> 01:44:43.901
<v Speaker 2>yourself and come back as a baby and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived your life again because this is a </v>

2375
01:44:43.901 --> 01:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>disaster we created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

2377
01:44:45.690 --> 01:44:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2378
01:44:46.641 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what it is when I see it.</v>

2379
01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think this is fixing it.</v>

2380
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I think this is fixing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually when I woke up this </v>

2381
01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:56.860
<v Speaker 2>morning and even when I went to bed last</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

2382
01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like in a great place because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

2383
01:44:59.271 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wanted to have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and I try.</v>

2384
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I've had it in little bites on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like.</v>

2385
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Not that this has really been about me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is about some big stuff,</v>

2386
01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but we're having more of a of a lofty </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing here.</v>

2387
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Then it is about you in a way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of this big stuff and also</v>

2388
01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:20.570
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing your show like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rubin report,</v>

2389
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:25.870
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is you're expressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you become a credible </v>

2390
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 2>portal to these ideas and information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is about you in a way because it's</v>

2391
01:45:30.951 --> 01:45:35.951
<v Speaker 2>about all of us and it's about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>credibility as that portal and you,</v>

2392
01:45:36.091 --> 01:45:38.150
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to defend that,</v>

2393
01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 2>that that's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2394
01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong about shit all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm wrong about shit,</v>

2395
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:48.550
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first person to tell you I'm </v>

2396
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.550
<v Speaker 2>wrong about it because I'm horrified if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2397
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 2>unless it's some simple stupid mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm.</v>

2398
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:53.900
<v Speaker 2>When I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I make a mistake,</v>

2399
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the first guy to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2400
01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody believing anything </v>

2401
01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:01.300
<v Speaker 2>that's not true to help my ego.</v>

2402
01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.380
<v Speaker 2>So you've had a carer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Maria on her.</v>

2403
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:05.180
<v Speaker 2>So she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a good friend of mine,</v>

2404
01:46:05.181 --> 01:46:07.850
<v Speaker 2>worked with me at tea lover and I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2405
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her too.</v>

2406
01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 2>She's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she is a science communicator.</v>

2407
01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:13.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the way she describes herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2408
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I think she had something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this brain surgery life thing last </v>

2409
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.550
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2410
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:21.391
<v Speaker 2>I machio yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's doing really good stuff and I </v>

2411
01:46:21.391 --> 01:46:22.700
<v Speaker 2>really respect her in Laker a many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said to my audience many times,</v>

2412
01:46:22.701 --> 01:46:24.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot about politics,</v>

2413
01:46:24.021 --> 01:46:24.980
<v Speaker 2>garden beds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

2414
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a science guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2415
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand basic stuff,</v>

2416
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:33.371
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to trust people that know </v>

2417
01:46:33.371 --> 01:46:36.551
<v Speaker 2>about science to tell me things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many times I've brought her on just </v>

2418
01:46:36.551 --> 01:46:37.630
<v Speaker 2>to clean up messes that I've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2419
01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 2>So I never go with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2420
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I never go with the presumption to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience that I know everything about </v>

2421
01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:45.400
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2422
01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring on some people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look then.</v>

2423
01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So when I've done things on GMO is with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cara,</v>

2424
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is,</v>

2425
01:46:50.161 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she firmly believes in Gmos and that's a</v>

2426
01:46:52.561 --> 01:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other thing,</v>

2427
01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know a lot of people don't like </v>

2428
01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 2>her stance on Gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I say,</v>

2429
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>here's my science person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what she said about this,</v>

2430
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:05.420
<v Speaker 2>and I'm actually trying to find someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a little more against GMO is now </v>

2431
01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:05.420
<v Speaker 2>to come on and refute some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2432
01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.240
<v Speaker 2>We don't have as the interviewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the guy on this side of it.</v>

2433
01:47:09.241 --> 01:47:14.241
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you said before that that </v>

2434
01:47:14.241 --> 01:47:14.241
<v Speaker 2>does give us a little bit of a leash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2435
01:47:14.241 --> 01:47:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Because we're sitting across from </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and we're just bouncing ideas.</v>

2436
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:19.920
<v Speaker 2>We're also talking about so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different subjects.</v>

2437
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to be an expert in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

2438
01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this actually goes to your point</v>

2439
01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>about the format of realtime and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these shows that look at,</v>

2440
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 2>look at where we bounced here already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2441
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:36.081
<v Speaker 2>There's only a couple areas where I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>real comfortable and saying I'm an </v>

2442
01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:37.740
<v Speaker 2>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an expert in stand up comedy and I'm</v>

2443
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 2>an expert in martial arts and even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts there's,</v>

2444
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 2>there's certain aspects of martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I have to defer to other experts.</v>

2445
01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2446
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.280
<v Speaker 2>there's just too many styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many different.</v>

2447
01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:47.870
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2448
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.450
<v Speaker 2>there's some different weird Filipinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's C lot,</v>

2449
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 2>there's different stick fighting styles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you can't know everything.</v>

2450
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:56.640
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't,</v>

2451
01:47:56.641 --> 01:48:01.641
<v Speaker 2>not only can't know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to see how the thing </v>

2452
01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:01.641
<v Speaker 2>that you consider yourself an expert in </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>

2453
01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:06.560
<v Speaker 2>how it all sort of leads to one road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what you did with men because you </v>

2454
01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:09.330
<v Speaker 2>had a set of principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2455
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:12.270
<v Speaker 2>You had a set of principles in something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you love.</v>

2456
01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2457
01:48:13.321 --> 01:48:18.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you love more than </v>

2458
01:48:18.321 --> 01:48:18.321
<v Speaker 2>stand up beside wife and kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2459
01:48:18.321 --> 01:48:18.321
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:48:18.321 --> 01:48:19.170
<v Speaker 2>friend's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids health,</v>

2461
01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of the other things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>

2462
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:23.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:23.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2464
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:28.730
<v Speaker 2>and what you did with Mensa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure you've talked about a </v>

2465
01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:28.730
<v Speaker 2>bajillion times already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2466
01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:30.600
<v Speaker 2>do you remember we met one to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what did we meet?</v>

2467
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.720
<v Speaker 2>We met at the young Turks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were going to do an air show and we </v>

2468
01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.191
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking for a few minutes and </v>

2469
01:48:40.191 --> 01:48:40.191
<v Speaker 2>obviously I knew who you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want.</v>

2470
01:48:40.191 --> 01:48:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comic too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just didn't.</v>

2471
01:48:40.381 --> 01:48:45.381
<v Speaker 2>So we just shot the shit for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and we talked about that a </v>

2472
01:48:45.381 --> 01:48:45.381
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that because you,</v>

2473
01:48:45.381 --> 01:48:50.131
<v Speaker 2>you used the set of principles that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>guiding you right now to do this show </v>

2474
01:48:50.131 --> 01:48:52.140
<v Speaker 2>are the same principles that you use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend your art in,</v>

2475
01:48:52.141 --> 01:48:53.490
<v Speaker 2>in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2476
01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 2>so all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all come together one way or </v>

2477
01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

2478
01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:00.600
<v Speaker 2>In some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with that men,</v>

2479
01:49:00.690 --> 01:49:04.980
<v Speaker 2>a thing was that the art form is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromised,</v>

2480
01:49:04.981 --> 01:49:07.080
<v Speaker 2>not just by him stealing from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2481
01:49:07.081 --> 01:49:12.081
<v Speaker 2>but him creating an environment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are terrified to express </v>

2482
01:49:12.081 --> 01:49:12.081
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean,</v>

2483
01:49:12.081 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 2>look at that social justice warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2484
01:49:13.771 --> 01:49:16.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing that they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>by jake yelling racist.</v>

2485
01:49:16.681 --> 01:49:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Now what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most sort of.</v>

2486
01:49:18.121 --> 01:49:20.280
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't express yourself because he</v>

2487
01:49:20.281 --> 01:49:23.850
<v Speaker 2>would steal those ideas and call them </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own and that's why I think there was</v>

2488
01:49:23.851 --> 01:49:28.851
<v Speaker 2>literally like a signal that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do where you'd be on stage for </v>

2489
01:49:28.851 --> 01:49:32.751
<v Speaker 2>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a 15 minute set and all of a </v>

2490
01:49:32.751 --> 01:49:32.751
<v Speaker 2>sudden five minutes in the light would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be on like,</v>

2491
01:49:32.751 --> 01:49:34.080
<v Speaker 2>why is the light on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have 10 more minutes ago.</v>

2492
01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It was [inaudible] been ceos in the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would let people know that </v>

2493
01:49:39.090 --> 01:49:39.090
<v Speaker 2>flashed the light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2494
01:49:39.090 --> 01:49:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a problem.</v>

2495
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:44.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the people that were running </v>

2496
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:46.101
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fucking retarded as well as the </v>

2497
01:49:46.101 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 2>people that were running these agencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>were fucking retarded.</v>

2498
01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Like the</v>

2499
01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>conversation that I had with my agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were telling me that I had to </v>

2500
01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 1>either apologize to him or they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to drop me.</v>

2501
01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you guys understand what you're </v>

2502
01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.771
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're making a decision right </v>

2503
01:50:01.771 --> 01:50:01.771
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're calling it business.</v>

2504
01:50:01.771 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>You're making a decision that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the rest of your life.</v>

2505
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:05.800
<v Speaker 1>You're supporting criminal and all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell is art.</v>

2506
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.960
<v Speaker 1>All you sell is art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all you guys do.</v>

2507
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:09.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't produce widgets.</v>

2508
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You guys aren't building cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are set your sellers of other </v>

2509
01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:19.111
<v Speaker 1>people's art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what an agent is and what you </v>

2510
01:50:19.111 --> 01:50:20.350
<v Speaker 1>have here is a guy who's stealing art </v>
<v Speaker 1>and selling it.</v>

2511
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Speaker 1>You have a vampire and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking this vampire.</v>

2512
01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:27.490
<v Speaker 1>He will suck the blood of the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses that you have on your roster.</v>

2513
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:30.100
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile the opposite has happened.</v>

2514
01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k left them immediately.</v>

2515
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:34.420
<v Speaker 1>David tell left them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Swardson left them with people that</v>

2516
01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 1>found out about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2517
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he left them.</v>

2518
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing was a disaster for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gersh from the agency at the time and </v>

2519
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you know that they've really never </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovered.</v>

2520
01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a little bit.</v>

2521
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I left for other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking disaster for them.</v>

2522
01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lost a fuck load of money because </v>

2523
01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:59.371
<v Speaker 1>of that one conversation that we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the phone where I would've stayed </v>

2524
01:50:59.371 --> 01:50:59.371
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2525
01:50:59.371 --> 01:50:59.880
<v Speaker 1>if you want to defend this Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2526
01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been my agent for years.</v>

2527
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the guy who,</v>

2528
01:51:03.611 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to name him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good dude.</v>

2529
01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:09.460
<v Speaker 1>But he was being put into position by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who owned the company that like,</v>

2530
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:14.461
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is calling me up saying he </v>

2531
01:51:14.461 --> 01:51:16.621
<v Speaker 1>demands that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that joe apologize to him and he wants </v>

2532
01:51:16.621 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 1>it to be a big deal and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2533
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be homeless.</v>

2534
01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And basically for people to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that the reason was because </v>

2535
01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:24.400
<v Speaker 1>at the time he was a bigger star than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2536
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the power play was.</v>

2537
01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 1>He was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was big enough star that I </v>

2538
01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:31.930
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be hurt by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rich.</v>

2539
01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

2540
01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I was on fear factor at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all this money and I'm like,</v>

2541
01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:39.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he tried.</v>

2542
01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:42.400
<v Speaker 1>He tried to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got me banned from the comedy store.</v>

2543
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:47.580
<v Speaker 1>He tried to get my agency and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in me where I'm already </v>

2544
01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:49.960
<v Speaker 1>untouchable in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really can't.</v>

2545
01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You really can't dig in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2546
01:51:51.581 --> 01:51:53.170
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to try though.</v>

2547
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So if I was a young comic coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have had some real damage.</v>

2548
01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:59.500
<v Speaker 1>He could have done some real damage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2549
01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's probably untold amount </v>

2550
01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:04.580
<v Speaker 1>of young comics that he lifted from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea of.</v>

2551
01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them contacted me while that </v>

2552
01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.300
<v Speaker 1>was going on and some of them didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be named and some of them didn't</v>

2553
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 1>mind if I named them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think honestly that most likely he</v>

2554
01:52:14.981 --> 01:52:18.310
<v Speaker 1>stole almost everything he did and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he stole it from different sources.</v>

2555
01:52:18.311 --> 01:52:23.311
<v Speaker 1>And change it around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got that with a lot of </v>

2556
01:52:23.311 --> 01:52:23.311
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got that over with a lot of,</v>

2557
01:52:23.311 --> 01:52:25.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really shitty comedians make it.</v>

2558
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways they make is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take other people's ideas and they move </v>

2559
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.270
<v Speaker 1>them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just enough.</v>

2560
01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Look even good comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2561
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

2562
01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has more talent or had more talented his</v>

2563
01:52:36.941 --> 01:52:38.290
<v Speaker 1>finger then I probably have been my </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole body.</v>

2564
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's well known deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2565
01:52:40.781 --> 01:52:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I know a comment personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know them too,</v>

2566
01:52:42.461 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but I won't name him for the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2567
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2568
01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Robin's</v>

2569
01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:51.020
<v Speaker 2>stole a bit from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he never told him but then just </v>

2570
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 2>sent him a check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You send him a $15,000</v>

2571
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did that.</v>

2572
01:52:52.251 --> 01:52:57.251
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of guys will get better as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>performer than he was as a creative guy.</v>

2573
01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Someone who came up with the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ever heard that phrase.</v>

2574
01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Parallel evolution has that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2575
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>so I had a comic when I was working in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York that I worked with almost every</v>

2576
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:12.720
<v Speaker 2>night and he started lifting from people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we all kind of knew at any,</v>

2577
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:17.740
<v Speaker 2>did exactly what you said it was like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would take the premise but then just </v>

2578
01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.050
<v Speaker 2>tweak it enough that every time I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching I'd go can't,</v>

2579
01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:20.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2580
01:53:20.710 --> 01:53:25.710
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all knew and one night I finally </v>

2581
01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:25.710
<v Speaker 2>confronted him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still doing standard by the way,</v>

2582
01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 2>and we've since become friends and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of apologized and whatever.</v>

2583
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And he said to me one night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2584
01:53:29.301 --> 01:53:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

2585
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:35.050
<v Speaker 2>don't you know about parallel evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The premise being that with these jokes </v>

2586
01:53:35.050 --> 01:53:36.080
<v Speaker 2>just evolve over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2587
01:53:36.081 --> 01:53:38.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about sort of current </v>
<v Speaker 2>event type things,</v>

2588
01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:43.001
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of it's just going to </v>

2589
01:53:43.001 --> 01:53:43.001
<v Speaker 2>evolve at the same time was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2590
01:53:43.001 --> 01:53:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I was about to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>

2591
01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:44.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2592
01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:49.780
<v Speaker 2>not only are you lifting jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also made up a theory that's pretty </v>

2593
01:53:50.021 --> 01:53:52.010
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could apply that sort of creative</v>

2594
01:53:52.011 --> 01:53:54.770
<v Speaker 2>thinking to your jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we wouldn't be in this problem and</v>

2595
01:53:54.771 --> 01:53:57.110
<v Speaker 2>that is part of the problem is that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of these people,</v>

2596
01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:02.160
<v Speaker 2>they have a self defeating tendency and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's self defeating tendency is that </v>

2597
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.801
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not willing to put in the work </v>

2598
01:54:05.801 --> 01:54:07.661
<v Speaker 2>because they're afraid of failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead they see success and they </v>

2599
01:54:07.661 --> 01:54:09.650
<v Speaker 2>just duplicate it and they literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicated in the premise,</v>

2600
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 2>duplicate the premises.</v>

2601
01:54:11.210 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 2>They duplicate the pathway to getting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the joke,</v>

2602
01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but the one thing they can't duplicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2603
01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's at the end of the day,</v>

2604
01:54:18.261 --> 01:54:23.261
<v Speaker 2>that's all we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget whether it's stand up or whether </v>

2605
01:54:23.261 --> 01:54:24.200
<v Speaker 2>it's radio or on your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what you have.</v>

2606
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.560
<v Speaker 2>The thing that at the end of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to you is something that you </v>

2607
01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:29.560
<v Speaker 2>can't really quantify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2608
01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Like you just people understand a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain series of things about you that </v>

2609
01:54:34.061 --> 01:54:34.061
<v Speaker 2>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the average person,</v>

2610
01:54:34.061 --> 01:54:35.510
<v Speaker 2>why do you like Rogan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could lay out a couple of things,</v>

2611
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 2>but there's that other thing that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>is there.</v>

2612
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:41.750
<v Speaker 2>They can't duplicate you bought in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case of a guy like Robin Williams.</v>

2613
01:54:41.751 --> 01:54:45.680
<v Speaker 2>He can do all the things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people like.</v>

2614
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a problem because if he goes </v>

2615
01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:52.751
<v Speaker 2>on before you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things that he </v>

2616
01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:56.021
<v Speaker 2>would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would steal someone's bit and then </v>

2617
01:54:56.021 --> 01:54:56.060
<v Speaker 2>bring them on because the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tag team,</v>

2618
01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you would go on and you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>

2619
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Good night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right this next comment because you </v>

2620
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.030
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd bring up your friend,</v>

2621
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no MC,</v>

2622
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:08.350
<v Speaker 2>no Mc at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would bring on guys right after </v>

2623
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:11.911
<v Speaker 2>he did their closing bit and he would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to fuck with them and he would do it </v>

2624
01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:12.110
<v Speaker 2>because he had some power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2625
01:55:12.111 --> 01:55:15.590
<v Speaker 2>And because the Mexican community is </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately looking for star Comedians,</v>

2626
01:55:15.591 --> 01:55:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a few of them.</v>

2627
01:55:18.490 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Like George Lopez was always a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gabriel,</v>

2628
01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Gabriel Iglesias is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sells out everywhere,</v>

2629
01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:30.260
<v Speaker 2>but he's a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the difference being that men,</v>

2630
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 2>ceos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really Mexican,</v>

2631
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2632
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:33.920
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was completely concocted.</v>

2633
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what really did him in more </v>

2634
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.950
<v Speaker 2>than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a fake name.</v>

2635
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.950
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2636
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>what was Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israeli illness.</v>

2637
01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the other one?</v>

2638
01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one of the redneck guys were </v>

2639
01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.390
<v Speaker 2>electric bob or frigerators south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cable guy.</v>

2640
01:55:49.391 --> 01:55:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And what's his real name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2641
01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Dan Whitney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2642
01:55:52.271 --> 01:55:54.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Dan was jokes.</v>

2643
01:55:54.211 --> 01:55:59.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind someone like dice clay's </v>

2644
01:55:59.211 --> 01:55:59.211
<v Speaker 2>real name was in dice clay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Silverstein.</v>

2645
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I was at a party a couple of weeks ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a dice was there and I was never a </v>

2646
01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:04.920
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge fan of his.</v>

2647
01:56:04.921 --> 01:56:07.920
<v Speaker 2>But I do remember around whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2648
01:56:07.921 --> 01:56:12.921
<v Speaker 2>maybe 89 slash 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little later when he sold out </v>

2649
01:56:12.921 --> 01:56:12.921
<v Speaker 2>the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he was in that,</v>

2650
01:56:12.921 --> 01:56:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that year of just sanity.</v>

2651
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching that and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2652
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:23.540
<v Speaker 2>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was one of the things that </v>

2653
01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:25.731
<v Speaker 2>really sparked me with standup because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I didn't love the material </v>

2654
01:56:25.731 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 2>and I understood that how stupid the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes were sort of,</v>

2655
01:56:26.690 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of this is fucking amazing.</v>

2656
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I went up to him at this party </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tapped my shoulder and I just </v>

2657
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave comic,</v>

2658
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2659
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2660
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.530
<v Speaker 2>And then walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

2661
01:56:37.531 --> 01:56:40.610
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've had such good.</v>

2662
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've had this too when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've met comics over the years </v>

2663
01:56:45.710 --> 01:56:48.441
<v Speaker 2>that you really admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much every single one that I've </v>

2664
01:56:48.441 --> 01:56:51.681
<v Speaker 2>ever admired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I lived on the upper west in New </v>

2665
01:56:51.681 --> 01:56:54.140
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived about two blocks away from </v>

2666
01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.491
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd bumped into him a lot and he was </v>

2667
01:56:55.491 --> 01:56:58.280
<v Speaker 2>a little hot and cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like basically like there was the </v>

2668
01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:58.280
<v Speaker 2>comic bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2669
01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2670
01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:58.980
<v Speaker 2>And I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dice was just,</v>

2671
01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:04.250
<v Speaker 2>he was so over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unfortunate because he's become </v>

2672
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>his persona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2673
01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.710
<v Speaker 2>he's dressed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2674
01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:10.770
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't always that guy like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressing,</v>

2675
01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing.</v>

2676
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:16.790
<v Speaker 2>That was a character in Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silverstein's act like the dice man was </v>

2677
01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 2>a guy who would do that was basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Lewis and the nutty professor.</v>

2678
01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Like if you've never seen the nutty </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>

2679
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a great movie and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great about it,</v>

2680
01:57:26.251 --> 01:57:31.251
<v Speaker 2>it's Jerry Lewis is like this nerdy guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who takes a potion that was approached </v>

2681
01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes this super cool daddio </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

2682
01:57:33.901 --> 01:57:36.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like 19 fucking whatever it was.</v>

2683
01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:41.241
<v Speaker 2>50 something probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a hilarious movie because you </v>

2684
01:57:41.241 --> 01:57:45.941
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately this guy becomes this guy </v>

2685
01:57:45.941 --> 01:57:47.730
<v Speaker 2>that the ladies love and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion starts wearing off and he goes</v>

2686
01:57:47.731 --> 01:57:52.260
<v Speaker 2>back to being as nerdy self again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dice is that guy.</v>

2687
01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2688
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:57.850
<v Speaker 2>that's who he is on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it was only a part of his act and </v>

2689
01:57:57.850 --> 01:57:59.250
<v Speaker 2>then it became the best part of his act </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it became his act.</v>

2690
01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Then it became him outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2691
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:04.440
<v Speaker 2>so now you see him walking around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

2692
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.560
<v Speaker 2>he's got the weightlifting gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got a jacket with the fucking.</v>

2693
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's got all the glitter on it and shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's be dazzled.</v>

2694
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2695
01:58:13.890 --> 01:58:15.490
<v Speaker 2>he's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2696
01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy he exists though.</v>

2697
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy him for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And think about like the fact that at </v>

2698
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:23.930
<v Speaker 2>that if you watch that Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 2>Garden special,</v>

2699
01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:25.890
<v Speaker 2>that all on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch it.</v>

2700
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:30.840
<v Speaker 2>People are announcing the jokes before </v>
<v Speaker 2>he even finishes the premise.</v>

2701
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:36.500
<v Speaker 2>That was the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it showed to me the power </v>

2702
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:36.500
<v Speaker 2>of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I always loved.</v>

2703
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I remember what got me into standup was </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was four years old,</v>

2704
01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>1986,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 19,</v>

2705
01:58:41.321 --> 01:58:46.321
<v Speaker 2>83.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw bill cosby himself on Hbo and I </v>

2706
01:58:46.321 --> 01:58:47.740
<v Speaker 2>was on the floor even though I probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even really understand what he was</v>

2707
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

2708
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought this was the greatest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2709
01:58:53.150 --> 01:58:54.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're growing up by the way,</v>

2710
01:58:54.311 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 2>when your childhood hero becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serial rapist,</v>

2711
01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 2>most successful series of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2712
01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

2713
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that sparked it in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sparked laughter and,</v>

2714
01:59:04.821 --> 01:59:07.390
<v Speaker 2>and wanting to make people laugh and </v>
<v Speaker 2>loving comedy for me.</v>

2715
01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the nice thing was like,</v>

2716
01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real.</v>

2717
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Now I understand the show to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well his standup was different in that </v>

2718
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:19.840
<v Speaker 2>not only did you know the punchline but </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole lines would sing a song.</v>

2719
01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted to hear the same jokes </v>

2720
01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.911
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very different from other </v>

2721
01:59:26.911 --> 01:59:26.911
<v Speaker 2>standup with stand up most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear the new bits.</v>

2722
01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2723
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:32.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to hear shit they haven't </v>

2724
01:59:32.401 --> 01:59:32.401
<v Speaker 2>heard before and I know that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Cosby,</v>

2725
01:59:32.401 --> 01:59:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do at this point because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone associates such terrible stuff.</v>

2726
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:40.260
<v Speaker 2>But I did see him live a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the most amazing things that </v>

2727
01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I ever saw a comic do ever was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2728
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew that whole himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

2729
01:59:44.290 --> 01:59:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Every comic loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

2730
01:59:45.791 --> 01:59:50.791
<v Speaker 2>So many from Chris Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Seinfeld to a zillion people credit </v>

2731
01:59:50.791 --> 01:59:53.341
<v Speaker 2>that with like being one of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>seminal things and the records and all </v>

2732
01:59:53.341 --> 01:59:55.951
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw cosby maybe 10 years ago in </v>

2733
01:59:55.951 --> 01:59:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Jersey and he was doing all new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2734
01:59:57.701 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2735
01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:03.720
<v Speaker 2>by his last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been that kind to him and even </v>

2736
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 2>just the way he looks and he's had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>health things,</v>

2737
02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:05.380
<v Speaker 2>like just what none of it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2738
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But then at the end he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do one old bit for you.</v>

2739
02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:11.140
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you all know it.</v>

2740
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I know you all know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna do one little bit for you.</v>

2741
02:00:13.301 --> 02:00:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And he did the dentist routine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew it,</v>

2742
02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 2>but he was such a master that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like watching him.</v>

2743
02:00:20.591 --> 02:00:25.591
<v Speaker 2>It was like watching someone with clay </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he could take the last before </v>

2744
02:00:25.591 --> 02:00:27.220
<v Speaker 2>they were coming and then just change it</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to keep them going more.</v>

2745
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:29.740
<v Speaker 2>And they weren't yelling out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchlines because it wasn't as,</v>

2746
02:00:29.741 --> 02:00:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like didactic or just set as,</v>

2747
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:35.580
<v Speaker 2>as a dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like it was,</v>

2748
02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:40.620
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing to watch to do comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>invent your old bit that you've now </v>

2749
02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:45.241
<v Speaker 2>reinvented a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they know it all and it was like as </v>

2750
02:00:45.241 --> 02:00:46.540
<v Speaker 2>good as ever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing to watch his old stuff.</v>

2751
02:00:46.570 --> 02:00:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the time it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a thing that you need to </v>

2752
02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:51.570
<v Speaker 2>take into consideration when you watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup standup,</v>

2753
02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:55.030
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a time machine.</v>

2754
02:00:55.150 --> 02:01:00.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a time capsule and like that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go back and listen to Lenny </v>

2755
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Bruce who is arguably the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comic ever.</v>

2756
02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And he's not very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2757
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:06.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not very good today.</v>

2758
02:01:06.341 --> 02:01:11.341
<v Speaker 2>And this is coming from someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>lenny bruce posters framed in his house </v>

2759
02:01:11.341 --> 02:01:12.390
<v Speaker 2>and I have Lenny Bruce live at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fillmore in,</v>

2760
02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.150
<v Speaker 2>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2761
02:01:13.210 --> 02:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>my office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's,</v>

2762
02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important guy ever.</v>

2763
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Well he changed the art definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply.</v>

2764
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:22.900
<v Speaker 2>He just fucking tore that thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not going to do jokes like that.</v>

2765
02:01:22.901 --> 02:01:25.660
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he opened it for everybody,</v>

2766
02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:31.050
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's often the case with a</v>

2767
02:01:31.361 --> 02:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>lot of the greats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of the old Carlin stuff is in</v>

2768
02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>that vein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2769
02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:41.461
<v Speaker 2>I understand its position in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you watch it or listen to it </v>

2770
02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not that good.</v>

2771
02:01:42.670 --> 02:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting the case with Cosby as </v>

2772
02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2773
02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:50.140
<v Speaker 2>so cosby for a while and especially now </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosby has this other thing attached to </v>

2774
02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.280
<v Speaker 2>them that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just becomes impossible to remove it.</v>

2775
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:53.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so lined up together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin,</v>

2776
02:01:53.321 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>so I had Kelly Carlin on this week was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>George's daughter who's a good friend of</v>

2777
02:01:56.901 --> 02:02:01.901
<v Speaker 2>mine and we talked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that and we related at </v>

2778
02:02:01.901 --> 02:02:01.901
<v Speaker 2>all to everything else we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about here,</v>

2779
02:02:01.901 --> 02:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>the social justice stuff and language </v>
<v Speaker 2>and words and you know,</v>

2780
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>being afraid to hear certain ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2781
02:02:07.761 --> 02:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>So it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting conversation.</v>

2782
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:15.100
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a bunch of Georgia stuff just </v>

2783
02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:15.100
<v Speaker 2>in preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it all a thousand times,</v>

2784
02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>but I thought actually a lot of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still does some of it.</v>

2785
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven dirty words sorta seemed </v>

2786
02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous now in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still pretty good.</v>

2787
02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even his last hbo special is fucking</v>

2788
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2789
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2790
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I've asked her this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew his health was failing at the </v>

2791
02:02:34.210 --> 02:02:37.391
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he knew he was gonna die </v>

2792
02:02:37.391 --> 02:02:39.761
<v Speaker 2>only a few months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a lot of ways if you watch it </v>

2793
02:02:39.761 --> 02:02:40.820
<v Speaker 2>knowing that he perhaps thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>his last special,</v>

2794
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.210
<v Speaker 2>it brings it to a whole other level </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he ends it.</v>

2795
02:02:44.211 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Really just wrapping up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wrapping up a 40 year.</v>

2796
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I think about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2797
02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.080
<v Speaker 2>it's pure brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2798
02:02:51.081 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>he did a new special every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you have that much material,</v>

2799
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some hits and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>misses.</v>

2800
02:02:57.681 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>But he certainly had way more hits and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had messes.</v>

2801
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>

2802
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:04.370
<v Speaker 2>he had like a five year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sort of low I guess maybe in the</v>

2803
02:03:04.371 --> 02:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>mid nineties or something where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it became just too much about </v>

2804
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>cursing and whatever.</v>

2805
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:11.660
<v Speaker 2>But beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

2806
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that represented a low in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life though you.</v>

2807
02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:17.210
<v Speaker 2>He had some issues in his own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal life.</v>

2808
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:18.270
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2809
02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.570
<v Speaker 2>when I was referring to was his old </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2810
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.700
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to when he looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weatherman.</v>

2811
02:03:22.701 --> 02:03:27.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about before he became </v>

2812
02:03:27.701 --> 02:03:28.310
<v Speaker 2>the George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back and put that time capsule</v>

2813
02:03:28.311 --> 02:03:30.770
<v Speaker 2>and try to like wash that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really that funny.</v>

2814
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:33.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is really interesting.</v>

2815
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:36.890
<v Speaker 2>The old stuff is woody allen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woody Allen's also,</v>

2816
02:03:36.891 --> 02:03:41.891
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking pervert and his old </v>

2817
02:03:41.891 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

2818
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look at all leaked into his movies,</v>

2819
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>his strange sexual stuff and young girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2820
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old was Mariel Hemingway in,</v>

2821
02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.250
<v Speaker 2>in Manhattan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

2822
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:57.251
<v Speaker 2>was first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she played under age and I don't know </v>

2823
02:03:57.251 --> 02:03:57.251
<v Speaker 2>how old she was.</v>

2824
02:03:57.251 --> 02:03:57.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like 17 or something.</v>

2825
02:03:57.251 --> 02:03:58.140
<v Speaker 2>How old was she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

2826
02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>

2827
02:03:59.901 --> 02:04:00.960
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Umm,</v>

2828
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:04.700
<v Speaker 2>but comedy isn't in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here's,</v>

2829
02:04:04.730 --> 02:04:06.180
<v Speaker 2>here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2830
02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Murphy raw at the time was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this monster standup thing that </v>

2831
02:04:11.781 --> 02:04:13.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody had to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2832
02:04:13.431 --> 02:04:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying.</v>

2833
02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Try watching that today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2834
02:04:16.671 --> 02:04:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobia,</v>

2835
02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.580
<v Speaker 2>but violently aggressively homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2836
02:04:22.610 --> 02:04:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Which is really weird when you consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the allegations that have surfaced </v>

2837
02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:31.811
<v Speaker 2>since with him and transgender people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and transsexuals and picking up hookers </v>

2838
02:04:31.811 --> 02:04:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that were men like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

2839
02:04:33.681 --> 02:04:35.930
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that we try to get.</v>

2840
02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Look at Oscar Wilde said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2841
02:04:38.161 --> 02:04:39.810
<v Speaker 2>if you want to tell people the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be funny.</v>

2842
02:04:39.811 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was asking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was lily Tomlin.</v>

2843
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>My total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something I can't remember.</v>

2844
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how nice man,</v>

2845
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny that we try as,</v>

2846
02:04:52.701 --> 02:04:57.701
<v Speaker 2>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so many of the people that of </v>

2847
02:04:57.701 --> 02:04:59.961
<v Speaker 2>course that we admired but that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is my are comedians because we're </v>

2848
02:04:59.961 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>supposed to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are supposed to tell the truth and,</v>

2849
02:05:00.811 --> 02:05:05.811
<v Speaker 2>and then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians are often either the sad clown</v>

2850
02:05:05.881 --> 02:05:10.881
<v Speaker 2>or severely emotionally crippled or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting that approval thing before and </v>

2851
02:05:11.011 --> 02:05:14.880
<v Speaker 2>all the lines that you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and it's a really bizarre place.</v>

2852
02:05:14.881 --> 02:05:19.881
<v Speaker 2>So then when you get and you suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>get all that approval and then it's </v>

2853
02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:21.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you still also grow as a human while</v>

2854
02:05:21.961 --> 02:05:26.961
<v Speaker 2>you're getting approval for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that came out of some disfunction and I </v>

2855
02:05:26.961 --> 02:05:28.530
<v Speaker 2>know this is the Angeles comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>

2856
02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to adjust what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you do it,</v>

2857
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:36.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it for other people </v>

2858
02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:36.680
<v Speaker 2>instead of doing it for yourself and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do it for the,</v>

2859
02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:36.900
<v Speaker 2>for the art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the work.</v>

2860
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And the work is profoundly enjoyable for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that love standup.</v>

2861
02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're a painter and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>only paint for yourself,</v>

2862
02:05:44.431 --> 02:05:48.780
<v Speaker 2>well you know at a certain point in time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running out of shit to paint when</v>

2863
02:05:48.781 --> 02:05:53.781
<v Speaker 2>you're painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess expressing yourself or the </v>

2864
02:05:53.781 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 2>desires of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think then it becomes different.</v>

2865
02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw George Carlin once just a little </v>

2866
02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:02.271
<v Speaker 2>bit before he died also on the view and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about the art lord poor </v>

2867
02:06:02.271 --> 02:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy took years off his life.</v>

2868
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.270
<v Speaker 2>We still have George today if you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make other thing that.</v>

2869
02:06:06.271 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I think he died that later that day.</v>

2870
02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something that I thought it was </v>

2871
02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2872
02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:16.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said when I became a good comment was</v>

2873
02:06:16.231 --> 02:06:18.310
<v Speaker 2>when I got over the need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2874
02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:21.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it's a good lesson for </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans in general,</v>

2875
02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>just for people like getting over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the need is of yourself and we </v>

2876
02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:27.030
<v Speaker 2>all struggle with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I struggle with it as a person</v>

2877
02:06:27.031 --> 02:06:30.000
<v Speaker 2>and as a comic and a host or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2878
02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Like we all have that shit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanting all that approval.</v>

2879
02:06:33.091 --> 02:06:38.091
<v Speaker 2>But when you can get over that and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really do things for the right clean</v>

2880
02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 2>reasons and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and live in and at the same time live in</v>

2881
02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:45.360
<v Speaker 2>a way that honors all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you stand up for.</v>

2882
02:06:46.150 --> 02:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's the,</v>

2883
02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what we should all be trying</v>

2884
02:06:51.841 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 2>to do at.</v>

2885
02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:54.610
<v Speaker 2>And it transcends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2886
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:58.230
<v Speaker 2>professional transcends comedy and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcends everything pretty much.</v>

2887
02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>

2888
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I think you're onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think also that that process of </v>

2889
02:07:04.730 --> 02:07:08.121
<v Speaker 2>like the need is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that's the fuel that gets you off the</v>

2890
02:07:08.161 --> 02:07:13.161
<v Speaker 2>earth and away from the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity and then the momentum of that </v>

2891
02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:18.920
<v Speaker 2>sort of carries you on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't necessarily have to keep </v>

2892
02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.960
<v Speaker 2>that fucking jet engine fire under your </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole all the time.</v>

2893
02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.910
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't,</v>

2894
02:07:23.911 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>that explained sorta like a white angst </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being fucked up or whatever it is.</v>

2895
02:07:28.561 --> 02:07:33.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they say comics are all fucked up </v>

2896
02:07:33.561 --> 02:07:33.561
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a certain amount of that.</v>

2897
02:07:33.561 --> 02:07:33.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get going,</v>

2898
02:07:33.561 --> 02:07:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a look,</v>

2899
02:07:34.921 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I did stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about</v>

2900
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did stand up.</v>

2901
02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.770
<v Speaker 3>We've only known each other for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

2902
02:07:38.771 --> 02:07:43.771
<v Speaker 3>two hours now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just signed up for about 10 years in </v>

2903
02:07:43.771 --> 02:07:46.201
<v Speaker 3>the closet now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was mostly doing political stuff and </v>

2904
02:07:46.201 --> 02:07:49.171
<v Speaker 3>social stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like I wasn't like outwardly </v>

2905
02:07:49.171 --> 02:07:49.171
<v Speaker 3>lying all the time and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2906
02:07:49.171 --> 02:07:49.171
<v Speaker 3>fuck this chicken that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2907
02:07:49.171 --> 02:07:53.741
<v Speaker 3>like it wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I constantly was avoiding the </v>

2908
02:07:53.741 --> 02:07:53.790
<v Speaker 3>truth onstage or if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2909
02:07:53.791 --> 02:07:56.710
<v Speaker 3>if I was getting heckled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were easy ways that I would insert</v>

2910
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:58.360
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Implied that I was straight or,</v>

2911
02:07:58.361 --> 02:08:03.361
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent sure there were times </v>

2912
02:08:03.361 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 3>that I made it seem like I was straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>

2913
02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.960
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that angst and that fuel really made me </v>

2914
02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:12.721
<v Speaker 3>successful really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was passed at the comedy cellar </v>

2915
02:08:12.721 --> 02:08:15.970
<v Speaker 3>like a year into doing standup and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a couple of years later,</v>

2916
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.110
<v Speaker 3>like it basically all crumbled on me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I realized that my life,</v>

2917
02:08:20.170 --> 02:08:24.850
<v Speaker 3>my person life was way behind where my </v>
<v Speaker 3>art was.</v>

2918
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.060
<v Speaker 3>And then I ended up doing gay shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was another fucking nightmare </v>

2919
02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.330
<v Speaker 3>because if you're a gay comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have one at every club,</v>

2920
02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

2921
02:08:31.931 --> 02:08:34.600
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of one like stereotypical </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay comic.</v>

2922
02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly I was the gay comic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't act that gay,</v>

2923
02:08:37.881 --> 02:08:40.300
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wasn't even gay enough for them.</v>

2924
02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.720
<v Speaker 3>And I ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I ended up on a gay TV channel on </v>

2925
02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 3>here TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was this like premium gay channel,</v>

2926
02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.960
<v Speaker 3>and then I ended up on the gay channel </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Sirius Xm.</v>

2927
02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about politics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead I was fucking interviewing real </v>

2928
02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.981
<v Speaker 3>housewives and all that shit and it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with anything I wanted to </v>

2929
02:08:59.861 --> 02:09:03.880
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's path is crazy and weird.</v>

2930
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your paths always going to be crazy and </v>

2931
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.030
<v Speaker 4>weird because we're human beings and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think you,</v>

2932
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:13.710
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're onto it as far as like this </v>

2933
02:09:13.710 --> 02:09:15.220
<v Speaker 4>fucked up aspect of you that needs love </v>
<v Speaker 4>so badly.</v>

2934
02:09:15.221 --> 02:09:20.221
<v Speaker 4>You want to go on stage with a spotlight</v>
<v Speaker 4>on you and a microphone to amplify your </v>

2935
02:09:20.221 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 4>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pay attention to me.</v>

2936
02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Then once you get to that position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's up to you to figure out the trick </v>

2937
02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:30.760
<v Speaker 4>because if you're a music a magician and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you believe that you're really pulling a</v>

2938
02:09:30.761 --> 02:09:33.370
<v Speaker 4>rabbit out of a fucking hat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an idiot.</v>

2939
02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:34.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're,</v>

2940
02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.800
<v Speaker 4>you're the guy with the trick and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trick is you know your voice is </v>

2941
02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:39.850
<v Speaker 4>amplified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on the stage.</v>

2942
02:09:39.851 --> 02:09:44.851
<v Speaker 4>You figured out the cadence and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypnotic rhythm in order to get people </v>

2943
02:09:44.851 --> 02:09:45.250
<v Speaker 4>to laugh at your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

2944
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.990
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you actually trying to do?</v>

2945
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:49.170
<v Speaker 4>If you're still trying to fill holes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you?</v>

2946
02:09:49.190 --> 02:09:50.530
<v Speaker 4>You fucking missed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

2947
02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:53.710
<v Speaker 4>That's just supposed to get you to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dance and once you're at the dance,</v>

2948
02:09:53.711 --> 02:09:58.711
<v Speaker 4>then it's supposed to be about creating </v>
<v Speaker 4>the art and it's supposed to be about </v>

2949
02:09:58.711 --> 02:09:59.020
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what is the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to make something really funny?</v>

2950
02:09:59.290 --> 02:10:01.230
<v Speaker 4>What is the best way to make something </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I.</v>

2951
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I contribute to culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I contribute to people's entertainment </v>

2952
02:10:06.341 --> 02:10:07.600
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go out,</v>

2953
02:10:07.601 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 4>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2954
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:10.570
<v Speaker 4>Dave Rubin has had the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight.</v>

2955
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Let's go on out and have a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they leave there and they go,</v>

2956
02:10:14.621 --> 02:10:16.510
<v Speaker 4>that was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2957
02:10:16.511 --> 02:10:18.430
<v Speaker 4>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the goal.</v>

2958
02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:23.431
<v Speaker 4>The goal is to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're changing the way people feel and </v>

2959
02:10:23.431 --> 02:10:24.220
<v Speaker 4>you can do that with ideas and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got to work them through,</v>

2960
02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:27.400
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what gets you to the dance and the first</v>

2961
02:10:27.401 --> 02:10:30.580
<v Speaker 4>place is you're fucked up past your </v>
<v Speaker 4>angst,</v>

2962
02:10:30.581 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 4>your insecurities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're all that shit.</v>

2963
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of the people that cling </v>
<v Speaker 4>to those things and they'd never get 'em</v>

2964
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:42.340
<v Speaker 4>never get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they make it and they don't know </v>

2965
02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:42.340
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck to do.</v>

2966
02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:43.750
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the really interesting part to me</v>

2967
02:10:43.751 --> 02:10:46.090
<v Speaker 3>because I lived on the upper west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

2968
02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:51.160
<v Speaker 3>put that microphone closer to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll hear it more because we can hear </v>

2969
02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:51.400
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.650
<v Speaker 3>When I get deep I start leaning into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2971
02:10:53.651 --> 02:10:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I lived on the upper west,</v>

2972
02:10:55.691 --> 02:11:00.691
<v Speaker 3>which is like a bastion of comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a zillion comics that live </v>

2973
02:11:00.691 --> 02:11:04.201
<v Speaker 3>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld lived up there and Elayne </v>

2974
02:11:04.201 --> 02:11:06.451
<v Speaker 3>boosler lived up there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor Negron who I met right before he </v>

2975
02:11:06.451 --> 02:11:06.820
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know I met him just a couple</v>

2976
02:11:06.821 --> 02:11:08.470
<v Speaker 3>of weeks before he was going to do my </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

2977
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:09.840
<v Speaker 3>He was a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

2978
02:11:09.841 --> 02:11:14.841
<v Speaker 3>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a zillion and a lot of younger </v>

2979
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:14.841
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2980
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:14.980
<v Speaker 3>But one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to see Greg Giraldo all the time.</v>

2981
02:11:14.981 --> 02:11:19.981
<v Speaker 3>He lived a couple blocks away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think you'll find this really </v>

2982
02:11:19.981 --> 02:11:19.981
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2983
02:11:19.981 --> 02:11:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know him personally,</v>

2984
02:11:20.441 --> 02:11:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but he knew I was a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just sort of nod when we were walking</v>

2985
02:11:22.901 --> 02:11:26.440
<v Speaker 3>by and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day I saw him walking,</v>

2986
02:11:26.441 --> 02:11:31.441
<v Speaker 3>his two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had his two young sons hand in hand </v>

2987
02:11:31.441 --> 02:11:31.441
<v Speaker 3>and he was walking between them and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

2988
02:11:31.441 --> 02:11:33.820
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy who I respect as a comic,</v>

2989
02:11:33.821 --> 02:11:36.100
<v Speaker 3>like doing good shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's funny,</v>

2990
02:11:36.250 --> 02:11:41.250
<v Speaker 3>he's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could always tell there was like </v>

2991
02:11:41.250 --> 02:11:41.250
<v Speaker 3>some pain there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like doing it,</v>

2992
02:11:41.250 --> 02:11:45.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting certain chances like I </v>

2993
02:11:45.961 --> 02:11:46.390
<v Speaker 3>think he never got like maybe whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have been his big chance,</v>

2994
02:11:46.391 --> 02:11:48.730
<v Speaker 3>but like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in the mix and respecting.</v>

2995
02:11:48.731 --> 02:11:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the next day after that I saw him,</v>

2996
02:11:51.130 --> 02:11:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I went to Equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the gym I went to on the upper west </v>

2997
02:11:56.130 --> 02:11:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and I saw him there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was working out and I was like,</v>

2998
02:11:56.130 --> 02:11:57.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy just with his kids.</v>

2999
02:11:57.761 --> 02:12:00.340
<v Speaker 3>He's working out like it's all seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's working for this guy.</v>

3000
02:12:00.341 --> 02:12:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Like it actually gave me hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3001
02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:07.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can become like a functioning person </v>

3002
02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>that weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weekend he was dead.</v>

3003
02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about him.</v>

3004
02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know him and it was,</v>

3005
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:16.860
<v Speaker 4>it was a pill thing was a drug thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3006
02:12:16.861 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm incredibly unfortunate.</v>

3007
02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I knew him when he had a television show</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when Greg had,</v>

3008
02:12:23.541 --> 02:12:24.530
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a show,</v>

3009
02:12:24.570 --> 02:12:25.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

3010
02:12:25.491 --> 02:12:30.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greg started out as a lawyer and he had </v>

3011
02:12:30.491 --> 02:12:32.330
<v Speaker 4>a show on one of the networks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think NBC,</v>

3012
02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so because I was on NBC at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and I don't think we're on the </v>

3013
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:38.780
<v Speaker 4>same network.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was ABC,</v>

3014
02:12:38.781 --> 02:12:42.440
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter what matters is we</v>
<v Speaker 4>were on the same lot.</v>

3015
02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:47.500
<v Speaker 4>We're both on that sunset gower lot that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about and we were next </v>

3016
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:47.500
<v Speaker 4>door to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'd hang out with them,</v>

3017
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just fellow comics,</v>

3018
02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:54.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the bond that we shared is </v>

3019
02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:54.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3020
02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.861
<v Speaker 4>he had a lot more responsibility than me</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was on this giant ensemble </v>

3021
02:12:56.861 --> 02:12:58.850
<v Speaker 4>where I was the fifth or sixth person on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

3022
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:00.920
<v Speaker 4>When the credits roll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3023
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like Phil Hartman or Dave Foley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mauritania.</v>

3024
02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:06.020
<v Speaker 4>So I had no pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

3025
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 4>he had the Greg Giraldo show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what it was called,</v>

3026
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:14.530
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was his show and he went from that </v>

3027
02:13:14.530 --> 02:13:18.110
<v Speaker 4>and then he was really a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tough crowd with Colin Quinn.</v>

3028
02:13:18.111 --> 02:13:20.450
<v Speaker 4>And there's that great moment where he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut down.</v>

3029
02:13:20.451 --> 02:13:25.451
<v Speaker 4>Dennis leary on tough crowd is like one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my all time favorite moments on tough</v>

3030
02:13:25.551 --> 02:13:30.551
<v Speaker 4>crowd because Dennis was getting upset </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Greg Geraldo had written jokes.</v>

3031
02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>He had funny things</v>

3032
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.330
<v Speaker 1>to say about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3033
02:13:33.331 --> 02:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Dennis.</v>

3034
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We write it,</v>

3035
02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:40.401
<v Speaker 1>write jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a classic moment with </v>

3036
02:13:40.401 --> 02:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Dennis is wearing sunglasses inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg's like in the prime and Dennis has </v>

3037
02:13:43.921 --> 02:13:45.950
<v Speaker 1>come in just horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3038
02:13:46.090 --> 02:13:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

3039
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:53.570
<v Speaker 1>he was a guy that I think was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected by a lot of other comedians </v>

3040
02:13:53.570 --> 02:13:56.550
<v Speaker 1>and was really good at roasts and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's Day,</v>

3041
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3042
02:13:57.211 --> 02:14:02.211
<v Speaker 1>he died a few years back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably would be just right now </v>

3043
02:14:02.211 --> 02:14:05.331
<v Speaker 1>crushing it like bill burris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be right now like be in his stride </v>

3044
02:14:05.331 --> 02:14:07.320
<v Speaker 1>because I think that what he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what he was was really good.</v>

3045
02:14:07.490 --> 02:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

3046
02:14:08.441 --> 02:14:10.010
<v Speaker 1>that goes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

3047
02:14:10.050 --> 02:14:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about that.</v>

3048
02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Literally the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm looking at this guy going,</v>

3049
02:14:13.441 --> 02:14:14.970
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it.</v>

3050
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That pill demon is a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different monster than the,</v>

3051
02:14:18.361 --> 02:14:19.800
<v Speaker 1>the opiate addict.</v>

3052
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:21.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different monster.</v>

3053
02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:22.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3054
02:14:22.151 --> 02:14:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the person who does meth or coke or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3055
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:28.650
<v Speaker 1>the people that go hard as a totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different monster.</v>

3056
02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scares the shit out of me,</v>

3057
02:14:30.391 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I smoked a ton of pot in my day,</v>

3058
02:14:33.190 --> 02:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>like pot yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my card a couple of weeks ago </v>

3059
02:14:38.190 --> 02:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the four slash 20 doctor on </v>

3060
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>melrose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to get a prescription,</v>

3061
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd have to go through a </v>

3062
02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>battery of tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3063
02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It was like a day of like probing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was being taken by joking.</v>

3064
02:14:50.611 --> 02:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

3065
02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a fucking idiot to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a prescription.</v>

3066
02:14:53.971 --> 02:14:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So I could not believe how easy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went in,</v>

3067
02:14:57.391 --> 02:14:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3068
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:59.530
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess like,</v>

3069
02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted weed to smoke weed.</v>

3070
02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any real physical elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3071
02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell him I get headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knees hurt after I play basketball,</v>

3072
02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:08.190
<v Speaker 1>back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the woman looked at me like,</v>

3073
02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went into.</v>

3074
02:15:11.371 --> 02:15:16.371
<v Speaker 1>I had never been to one of the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the dispensary's went in there </v>

3075
02:15:16.371 --> 02:15:20.001
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still can't believe I've only been </v>

3076
02:15:20.001 --> 02:15:21.621
<v Speaker 1>there a couple of times now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't believe like just the level </v>

3077
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:21.621
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real salesperson,</v>

3078
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy and edibles and oil,</v>

3079
02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful.</v>

3080
02:15:25.450 --> 02:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>She wanted oils and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3081
02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:31.160
<v Speaker 1>so there's oils with a wax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3082
02:15:31.190 --> 02:15:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you have any weed and weed for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there any,</v>

3083
02:15:33.211 --> 02:15:34.800
<v Speaker 1>is that it left anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3084
02:15:34.801 --> 02:15:36.180
<v Speaker 1>just some bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got,</v>

3085
02:15:36.181 --> 02:15:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I got oil so it's all there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's available.</v>

3086
02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is once you,</v>

3087
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:43.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you go down to the first floor,</v>

3088
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3089
02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Is there a basement then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3090
02:15:46.111 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 1>there is a basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that door in the basement.</v>

3091
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the sub basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look in the sub basement and then </v>

3092
02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you start going deep and next thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're in a spiral staircase.</v>

3093
02:15:54.691 --> 02:15:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much pot these smoke?</v>

3094
02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke a fair bit depending upon </v>

3095
02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:01.920
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I'm at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

3096
02:16:01.921 --> 02:16:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy getting high and going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

3097
02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I like to get high before I do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked to get high before I give the </v>

3098
02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:13.161
<v Speaker 1>misses a stabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to get high before I get an </v>

3099
02:16:13.161 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 1>isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isolation tank.</v>

3100
02:16:13.801 --> 02:16:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

3101
02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy marijuana.</v>

3102
02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of my friends.</v>

3103
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:19.370
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3104
02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

3105
02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So also I'd like the fact that I </v>

3106
02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:28.710
<v Speaker 1>represent the opposite of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotype.</v>

3107
02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:30.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing shit.</v>

3108
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>

3109
02:16:32.021 --> 02:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana makes you lazy.</v>

3110
02:16:33.911 --> 02:16:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you're fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could be lazy and,</v>

3111
02:16:37.410 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and eat cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean cheetos make you lazy?</v>

3112
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>You can be lazy and watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean TV makes you lazy?</v>

3113
02:16:42.401 --> 02:16:47.401
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're looking for some reasons </v>

3114
02:16:47.401 --> 02:16:51.031
<v Speaker 1>why people have flaws and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and I don't think you could </v>

3115
02:16:51.031 --> 02:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>say it's marijuana because marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all good aspects to it know,</v>

3116
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>like many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3117
02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it has good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad thing is the memory,</v>

3118
02:16:57.610 --> 02:16:59.170
<v Speaker 1>the memory thing is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

3119
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.480
<v Speaker 1>what were we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's fleeting,</v>

3120
02:17:01.570 --> 02:17:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like longterm memory,</v>

3121
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:07.960
<v Speaker 1>long term memory is fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be because of the UFC.</v>

3122
02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

3123
02:17:09.141 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 1>a bio when I do the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which uh,</v>

3124
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:17.070
<v Speaker 1>will tell me like a fighters record tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>me who they're training with and tell </v>

3125
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:17.070
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3126
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:19.060
<v Speaker 1>But when the matches are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not leafing through papers.</v>

3127
02:17:19.061 --> 02:17:24.061
<v Speaker 1>If I start talking about a fight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened seven years ago in another </v>

3128
02:17:24.061 --> 02:17:24.760
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's in my head,</v>

3129
02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I talked to people and they're </v>

3130
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of preparation do you do?</v>

3131
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing any preparation,</v>

3132
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the preparation that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not the preparation that I'm </v>

3133
02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:34.920
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do anyway.</v>

3134
02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:39.181
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch their fights because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're coming up so I'll wash </v>

3135
02:17:39.181 --> 02:17:40.450
<v Speaker 1>their shit if I need to know about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their training methods,</v>

3136
02:17:40.451 --> 02:17:45.451
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are things that I will do because </v>

3137
02:17:45.451 --> 02:17:45.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

3138
02:17:45.451 --> 02:17:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to broaden my understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what their preparation is that because I</v>

3139
02:17:49.571 --> 02:17:54.571
<v Speaker 1>want to enjoy the fight more and I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight more if I do that and then I </v>

3140
02:17:54.571 --> 02:17:55.450
<v Speaker 1>expressed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that stuff is off memory.</v>

3141
02:17:55.450 --> 02:17:56.260
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3142
02:17:56.261 --> 02:18:01.261
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm doing like how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many notes do you have in front of </v>

3143
02:18:01.261 --> 02:18:03.781
<v Speaker 1>you that I write zero on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you hear me talking about old </v>

3144
02:18:03.781 --> 02:18:07.771
<v Speaker 1>matches and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit is in my head because I </v>

3145
02:18:07.771 --> 02:18:09.130
<v Speaker 1>have to have good memory and if I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that pot was fucking with that,</v>

3146
02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I would stop smoking pot but it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will fuck with like.</v>

3147
02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Well we just talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3148
02:18:13.221 --> 02:18:18.221
<v Speaker 1>I know that it'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think twitter is doing that </v>

3149
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:18.221
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer in that,</v>

3150
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that all of these things and having this</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone constantly,</v>

3151
02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:23.770
<v Speaker 1>that that's framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking really just splitting</v>

3152
02:18:23.771 --> 02:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>and disintegrating people's memory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially short term memory.</v>

3153
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I see on my show all the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone will,</v>

3154
02:18:30.250 --> 02:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>beyond just talking about anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they forget what they're </v>

3155
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3156
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about 70 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3157
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a 30 year old people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3158
02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:41.670
<v Speaker 1>there used to be a time if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to meet a buddy out for are you </v>

3159
02:18:41.670 --> 02:18:41.670
<v Speaker 1>going to meet a girl for a drink or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

3160
02:18:41.670 --> 02:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>You're waiting on a corner and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

3161
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:45.880
<v Speaker 1>She's five minutes late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to stand there and just.</v>

3162
02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wait.</v>

3163
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Think about some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the sky and the people watching </v>

3164
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you immediately,</v>

3165
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you immediately do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can immediately scroll and see an </v>

3166
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.070
<v Speaker 1>approval,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is and all of that.</v>

3170
02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And it goes to what we started with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing about and six second videos </v>

3171
02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>and all of the shit and this bounce back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of why people like this now is because </v>

3172
02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:15.391
<v Speaker 1>all of this I really think is they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done studies where it's actually </v>

3173
02:19:15.391 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 1>rewiring synopsis and all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changing people's brains,</v>

3174
02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:21.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the Internet is actually having</v>

3175
02:19:21.251 --> 02:19:26.251
<v Speaker 1>a physical effect on us that's not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting next or hungover and done neck </v>

3176
02:19:26.251 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>thing is real man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're worried that</v>

3177
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:33.010
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna like older people of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our generation and before or are going </v>

3178
02:19:33.010 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 4>to have real issues with their neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're always looking down.</v>

3179
02:19:35.350 --> 02:19:40.350
<v Speaker 4>And that in looking down like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stretching the ligaments and </v>

3180
02:19:40.350 --> 02:19:41.780
<v Speaker 4>stretching your neck and putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure on your discs.</v>

3181
02:19:43.170 --> 02:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Even when I'm holding my ipad I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've done something to my pinky.</v>

3182
02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Pinky has like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding,</v>

3183
02:19:48.701 --> 02:19:53.701
<v Speaker 3>like I've got like two little </v>
<v Speaker 3>indentations here because I'm holding </v>

3184
02:19:53.701 --> 02:19:53.701
<v Speaker 3>this thing all the time like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3185
02:19:53.701 --> 02:19:56.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean really people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do all kinds of weird shit.</v>

3186
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:57.340
<v Speaker 3>How if you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lefty.</v>

3187
02:19:57.341 --> 02:20:02.341
<v Speaker 3>So like if I'm writing like I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little indentation on my index finger </v>

3188
02:20:02.341 --> 02:20:06.361
<v Speaker 3>because the power is always in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you actually can physically change </v>

3189
02:20:06.361 --> 02:20:06.670
<v Speaker 3>your body by</v>

3190
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:10.300
<v Speaker 4>some of this technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>unquestionable.</v>

3191
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:13.550
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a from writing from </v>
<v Speaker 4>drawing.</v>

3192
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a big callus on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of my fuck.</v>

3193
02:20:15.971 --> 02:20:19.060
<v Speaker 4>You finger on my right a little extra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it was not,</v>

3194
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 4>it was not that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it's just from.</v>

3195
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I drew like hours and hours every day </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was young and I always had these </v>

3196
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:27.170
<v Speaker 4>big calluses all over there and they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>all gone away.</v>

3197
02:20:27.171 --> 02:20:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how that happens.</v>

3198
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:30.230
<v Speaker 4>But to start drawing again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3199
02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:32.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the neck thing is a real,</v>

3200
02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:33.140
<v Speaker 4>real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3201
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:37.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's gotten me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously your eyes degenerate as</v>

3202
02:20:37.161 --> 02:20:39.740
<v Speaker 4>you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about close vision.</v>

3203
02:20:39.741 --> 02:20:44.741
<v Speaker 4>But with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's got to be connected at </v>

3204
02:20:44.741 --> 02:20:47.351
<v Speaker 4>least somewhat to staring at screens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's bad for your focusing on </v>

3205
02:20:47.351 --> 02:20:51.791
<v Speaker 4>any short term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something that's really close to </v>

3206
02:20:51.791 --> 02:20:51.791
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3207
02:20:51.791 --> 02:20:53.630
<v Speaker 4>And who the fuck was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was on the podcast that referred to</v>

3208
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 4>it as like a cast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who it was.</v>

3209
02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:00.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a short term memory.</v>

3210
02:21:00.381 --> 02:21:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is,</v>

3211
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:04.670
<v Speaker 4>who sleeps on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember the chick who,</v>

3212
02:21:04.671 --> 02:21:09.671
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't sleep on beds and she's got </v>

3213
02:21:09.671 --> 02:21:09.710
<v Speaker 4>this interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cathy is her name.</v>

3214
02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Cathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3215
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.490
<v Speaker 4>what Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll find it.</v>

3216
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:18.700
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way she described it as she was </v>

3217
02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:18.700
<v Speaker 4>saying that when you're staring Kathy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bowman.</v>

3218
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:19.850
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3219
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Katy Bowman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

3220
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Katy Bowman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She that she said when you were staring </v>

3221
02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:28.601
<v Speaker 4>at one distance all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just treating your face and your laptop </v>

3222
02:21:28.601 --> 02:21:31.870
<v Speaker 4>or your face in your phone is that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes are supposed to look at clothes,</v>

3223
02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:36.880
<v Speaker 4>things and far things and look at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>broad range of distances and instead </v>

3224
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:42.730
<v Speaker 4>you're only looking at something right </v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of your face and it fucks with </v>

3225
02:21:42.730 --> 02:21:44.620
<v Speaker 4>literally shape of your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's your,</v>

3226
02:21:44.621 --> 02:21:49.621
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body doesn't know what the fuck to </v>

3227
02:21:49.621 --> 02:21:49.621
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

3228
02:21:49.621 --> 02:21:49.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>

3229
02:21:49.621 --> 02:21:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Our grandparents or even our parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3230
02:21:51.811 --> 02:21:54.600
<v Speaker 3>my dad was born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no such thing as television.</v>

3231
02:21:55.170 --> 02:21:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm 39 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane,</v>

3232
02:21:57.111 --> 02:22:02.111
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our grandparents had no screens that </v>

3233
02:22:02.111 --> 02:22:02.111
<v Speaker 3>didn't even have radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3234
02:22:02.111 --> 02:22:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Radio just maybe started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3235
02:22:03.391 --> 02:22:05.040
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a window radio started giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3236
02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3237
02:22:06.841 --> 02:22:10.770
<v Speaker 3>So my grandparents were wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that 19 twenties?</v>

3238
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean really think about that,</v>

3239
02:22:12.931 --> 02:22:16.290
<v Speaker 3>how we've changed 100 years and as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about earlier about how the</v>

3240
02:22:16.291 --> 02:22:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Internet's going to change us and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning so much more faster and all </v>

3241
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:24.411
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's so involved in this </v>

3242
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:24.411
<v Speaker 3>digital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3243
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:27.831
<v Speaker 3>the matrix is becoming real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately we're just the batteries for </v>

3244
02:22:27.831 --> 02:22:30.120
<v Speaker 3>these things to keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3245
02:22:30.121 --> 02:22:35.040
<v Speaker 3>like they were just putting information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're putting whatever our spirit is,</v>

3246
02:22:35.041 --> 02:22:40.041
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call that is just </v>

3247
02:22:40.041 --> 02:22:41.160
<v Speaker 3>the battery for this digital thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

3248
02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you know who Marshall Mcluhan says?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3249
02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an author from the fifties and sixties,</v>

3250
02:22:48.221 --> 02:22:49.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

3251
02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:54.860
<v Speaker 4>he was a part of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a part of the counterculture and </v>

3252
02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:55.000
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways a lot of people quote </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3253
02:22:55.001 --> 02:22:59.260
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things that he said about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is technology before computers,</v>

3254
02:22:59.650 --> 02:23:04.650
<v Speaker 4>he said human beings are the sex organs </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the machine world and the idea that </v>

3255
02:23:04.650 --> 02:23:09.571
<v Speaker 4>we exist to create these machines and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>firmly believe that what we're doing is </v>

3256
02:23:11.411 --> 02:23:16.411
<v Speaker 4>we are some sort of a technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>caterpillar and we're giving birth to a </v>

3257
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:17.140
<v Speaker 4>new life form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

3258
02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:22.200
<v Speaker 4>really believed that and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Elon Musk and what he said about </v>

3259
02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.740
<v Speaker 4>summoning the demon in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence,</v>

3260
02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:27.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's off at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's gonna come a time,</v>

3261
02:23:27.131 --> 02:23:29.110
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 100 years or a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

3262
02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:34.720
<v Speaker 4>human life and this biological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biological limitations of our own </v>

3263
02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:36.820
<v Speaker 4>cellular bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be ridiculous.</v>

3264
02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:37.690
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna.</v>

3265
02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:39.280
<v Speaker 4>We're just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of them.</v>

3266
02:23:39.310 --> 02:23:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3267
02:23:40.151 --> 02:23:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's gonna be that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 or if I forget if that was,</v>

3268
02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:47.990
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be long gone from this </v>

3269
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:49.770
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think people won't be </v>

3270
02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:49.770
<v Speaker 3>around a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3271
02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3272
02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:55.321
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people are probably </v>

3273
02:23:55.321 --> 02:23:55.321
<v Speaker 3>going to die here on our dying planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3274
02:23:55.321 --> 02:23:58.350
<v Speaker 3>rich people mainly are going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to escape with spaceships.</v>

3275
02:23:58.380 --> 02:23:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to.</v>

3276
02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to lie.</v>

3277
02:24:01.901 --> 02:24:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I guess we've given up on the moon right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3278
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:05.200
<v Speaker 3>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to go.</v>

3279
02:24:05.201 --> 02:24:10.201
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find something that has </v>

3280
02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:11.950
<v Speaker 3>some of the basic building blocks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life like earth,</v>

3281
02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:13.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3282
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:14.830
<v Speaker 3>you know Carl Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

3283
02:24:14.831 --> 02:24:19.831
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our son is not spectacular by any </v>

3284
02:24:19.831 --> 02:24:22.831
<v Speaker 3>stretch and we know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions and billions of sons in this </v>

3285
02:24:22.831 --> 02:24:22.831
<v Speaker 3>galaxy and this university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3286
02:24:22.831 --> 02:24:27.481
<v Speaker 3>that whole thing and it endlessly </v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolates and all we are just a tiny </v>

3287
02:24:27.481 --> 02:24:31.861
<v Speaker 3>rock with that had the right distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the sun and the right amount of </v>

3288
02:24:31.861 --> 02:24:35.551
<v Speaker 3>chemicals to make all this shit happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find something that's </v>

3289
02:24:35.551 --> 02:24:35.710
<v Speaker 3>going to be similar to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it'll,</v>

3290
02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:37.720
<v Speaker 3>it'll all be 10 degrees hotter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

3291
02:24:37.721 --> 02:24:40.060
<v Speaker 3>everything will have evolved slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

3292
02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could pick like I love star wars,</v>

3293
02:24:43.061 --> 02:24:44.770
<v Speaker 3>you can pick any of those planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3294
02:24:45.370 --> 02:24:50.370
<v Speaker 3>it just evolved differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be a planet that's know mostly </v>

3295
02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:53.341
<v Speaker 3>water and will have to eventually learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with that unless the guys </v>

3296
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:55.050
<v Speaker 3>get here first and kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but possible to that is possible</v>

3297
02:24:55.070 --> 02:25:00.070
<v Speaker 4>spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that our own biological </v>

3298
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:02.531
<v Speaker 4>limitations are on organisms are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>acutely adapted to this environment,</v>

3299
02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:07.780
<v Speaker 4>the environment of planet earth that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be insanely difficult for us to </v>

3300
02:25:09.051 --> 02:25:14.051
<v Speaker 4>colonize another planet and insanely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insanely problematic when it comes to </v>

3301
02:25:15.201 --> 02:25:20.201
<v Speaker 4>dealing with whatever life has already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're dealing with the environment </v>

3302
02:25:20.201 --> 02:25:21.740
<v Speaker 4>dealing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be better to just fix this spot.</v>

3303
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope we fucking falling apart.</v>

3304
02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Like we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a shitty old car and we're like,</v>

3305
02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:33.360
<v Speaker 4>let's just abandon it and leave it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lawn and move to the neighbor's </v>

3306
02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:33.790
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really the idea,</v>

3307
02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:38.791
<v Speaker 4>but the neighbor's house is on fire all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and it gets pelted with </v>

3308
02:25:38.791 --> 02:25:42.331
<v Speaker 4>asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to put all of our </v>

3309
02:25:42.331 --> 02:25:44.281
<v Speaker 4>effort into flying to some other planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and on the way there their son's going </v>

3310
02:25:44.281 --> 02:25:47.521
<v Speaker 4>to Supernova and then we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>blow up in the middle of space and I'll </v>

3311
02:25:47.521 --> 02:25:51.001
<v Speaker 4>hope will be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think people have been </v>

3312
02:25:51.001 --> 02:25:52.440
<v Speaker 4>inspired by this conversation and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've people back here on earth.</v>

3313
02:25:52.441 --> 02:25:53.860
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to regroup and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3314
02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop trying to go to space and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just clean the ocean.</v>

3315
02:25:57.370 --> 02:25:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3316
02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:01.450
<v Speaker 3>I really think are something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>

3317
02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Something about look right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even if we cut,</v>

3318
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:10.510
<v Speaker 3>and again I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd even when we cut our greenhouse </v>

3319
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.510
<v Speaker 3>gases here in America and we do all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3320
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:12.250
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these developing nations,</v>

3321
02:26:12.251 --> 02:26:17.251
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going through what we went </v>

3322
02:26:17.251 --> 02:26:19.291
<v Speaker 3>through 60 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we have the UN meet and try to </v>

3323
02:26:19.291 --> 02:26:22.621
<v Speaker 3>get everybody to come up with numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to allow to put out </v>

3324
02:26:22.621 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 3>this much smog and this much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this bullshit.</v>

3325
02:26:24.850 --> 02:26:29.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what right do we have to tell them not </v>

3326
02:26:29.850 --> 02:26:32.020
<v Speaker 3>to do everything they can to advance </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way we did 50 years ago.</v>

3327
02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:32.550
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3328
02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:34.150
<v Speaker 3>So it's funny and I live in West </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood.</v>

3329
02:26:34.151 --> 02:26:35.410
<v Speaker 3>There are no plastic bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3330
02:26:35.411 --> 02:26:37.720
<v Speaker 3>And they don't even want to give me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper bag at trader Joe's anymore.</v>

3331
02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:38.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay for it,</v>

3332
02:26:38.941 --> 02:26:40.050
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

3333
02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I mostly just pay for paper bags at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

3334
02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:44.440
<v Speaker 3>They hate me too because I never bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own bag.</v>

3335
02:26:44.441 --> 02:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pay that ten cents for that.</v>

3336
02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:49.030
<v Speaker 4>They hate you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3337
02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:49.960
<v Speaker 4>you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The judge,</v>

3338
02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:52.100
<v Speaker 4>the horrible judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need those paper bags.</v>

3339
02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:55.050
<v Speaker 4>I use the paper bags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recycling in them.</v>

3340
02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:57.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's also how I light the fire.</v>

3341
02:26:57.261 --> 02:27:02.261
<v Speaker 4>When I use my grill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stuffed the paper bag underneath the </v>

3342
02:27:02.261 --> 02:27:02.990
<v Speaker 4>little charcoal chimney I use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3343
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Well they'd hate you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck them.</v>

3344
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Short sided bitches.</v>

3345
02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3346
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:09.950
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think the,</v>

3347
02:27:09.951 --> 02:27:11.810
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

3348
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 100 years they'd be hard for me </v>

3349
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.110
<v Speaker 3>to believe that things could still be </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on around here.</v>

3350
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 years ago,</v>

3351
02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 4>you'd be amazed at what progress has </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken place.</v>

3352
02:27:19.781 --> 02:27:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Socially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be amazed.</v>

3353
02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about that.</v>

3354
02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Think about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>65 was the last time slavery was legal,</v>

3355
02:27:26.501 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of that.</v>

3356
02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I think that's an awful long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long time ago now.</v>

3357
02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:33.520
<v Speaker 4>That's almost 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3358
02:27:33.521 --> 02:27:36.160
<v Speaker 4>From when I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was born in [inaudible] 67,</v>

3359
02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:39.740
<v Speaker 4>so 102 years later I was born after </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep,</v>

3360
02:27:39.741 --> 02:27:42.670
<v Speaker 4>but that's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A 100 years is not that much time.</v>

3361
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I think that a thousand years from now </v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows what kind of </v>

3362
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.170
<v Speaker 4>technological capabilities we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have as far as our ability to not </v>

3363
02:27:52.170 --> 02:27:55.750
<v Speaker 4>just not create waste,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to use up all the waste that we have</v>

3364
02:27:55.751 --> 02:28:00.040
<v Speaker 4>created and use it in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because you burn gasoline,</v>

3365
02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:05.041
<v Speaker 4>it creates pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that's the only way you </v>

3366
02:28:05.041 --> 02:28:05.980
<v Speaker 4>can get energy and just because </v>
<v Speaker 4>pollution is in the air,</v>

3367
02:28:05.981 --> 02:28:09.740
<v Speaker 4>carbon dioxide is hitting record levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that can't be maintained</v>

3368
02:28:09.741 --> 02:28:14.741
<v Speaker 4>and regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's gotta be a way that </v>

3369
02:28:14.741 --> 02:28:17.041
<v Speaker 4>people can figure out how to live </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainably if it's possible to live </v>

3370
02:28:17.041 --> 02:28:21.271
<v Speaker 4>sustainably in a small community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible to live sustainably </v>

3371
02:28:21.271 --> 02:28:21.920
<v Speaker 4>globally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you do it for yourself,</v>

3372
02:28:21.921 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

3373
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:24.280
<v Speaker 3>when you hunt for your meat and you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy,</v>

3374
02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:25.250
<v Speaker 3>have chickens before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you.</v>

3375
02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:30.251
<v Speaker 3>When you do all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you feel that you're doing it for </v>

3376
02:28:30.251 --> 02:28:32.330
<v Speaker 3>yourself or you're doing it for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>community or is it 50 slash 50</v>

3377
02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:36.150
<v Speaker 4>zero and be totally honest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero for my community,</v>

3378
02:28:36.151 --> 02:28:39.060
<v Speaker 4>zero for the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just thinking what's the best way?</v>

3379
02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:41.340
<v Speaker 4>This is just my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my intent going in.</v>

3380
02:28:41.341 --> 02:28:42.840
<v Speaker 4>I understand that it's better for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

3381
02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:48.200
<v Speaker 4>but my intent going in is like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to rely on other people for my </v>

3382
02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:52.521
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to rely on some farmer to </v>

3383
02:28:52.521 --> 02:28:54.540
<v Speaker 4>not shove antibiotics and hormones and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the food.</v>

3384
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I want to be able to eat clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy food.</v>

3385
02:28:56.911 --> 02:28:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethically,</v>

3386
02:28:58.410 --> 02:29:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a part of the factory</v>
<v Speaker 4>farming system.</v>

3387
02:29:01.171 --> 02:29:04.200
<v Speaker 4>I think when I watch these youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>

3388
02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:09.201
<v Speaker 4>he's peta videos on how they raised pigs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cows and it's fucking evil.</v>

3389
02:29:09.391 --> 02:29:11.730
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather shoot a wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather.</v>

3390
02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:13.540
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather eat moose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3391
02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I think it's better for you to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein wise,</v>

3392
02:29:16.021 --> 02:29:21.021
<v Speaker 4>the protein content of elk and Moose is </v>
<v Speaker 4>far higher than the protein content of </v>

3393
02:29:21.021 --> 02:29:21.210
<v Speaker 4>beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better for you.</v>

3394
02:29:21.211 --> 02:29:23.370
<v Speaker 4>You can eat smaller portions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get more out of it.</v>

3395
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

3396
02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:30.120
<v Speaker 4>it gives me a better feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know where everything came from when I</v>

3397
02:29:30.121 --> 02:29:34.050
<v Speaker 4>eat a steak that I cut from an elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

3398
02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:39.440
<v Speaker 4>That is such a different feeling than </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go to the supermarket and you </v>

3399
02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:43.521
<v Speaker 4>get something of ambiguous origins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic wrapped container and just take </v>

3400
02:29:43.521 --> 02:29:45.720
<v Speaker 4>it home and cut open a plastic and slap </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on the grill and.</v>

3401
02:29:45.730 --> 02:29:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Or I'm out here growing locker man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know</v>

3402
02:29:48.310 --> 02:29:52.300
<v Speaker 3>trader Joe's that when you get just </v>
<v Speaker 3>chopped me from trader Joe's,</v>

3403
02:29:52.330 --> 02:29:57.330
<v Speaker 3>it comes from four different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have four countries of origin on </v>

3404
02:29:57.491 --> 02:29:58.270
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For beef,</v>

3405
02:29:58.330 --> 02:30:00.310
<v Speaker 3>for beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go right now.</v>

3406
02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3407
02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:03.220
<v Speaker 3>You could go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can google it,</v>

3408
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:05.290
<v Speaker 3>the that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from,</v>

3409
02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

3410
02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.840
<v Speaker 3>something like the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

3411
02:30:07.841 --> 02:30:12.841
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like something that we're not </v>

3412
02:30:12.841 --> 02:30:13.420
<v Speaker 3>even geographically connected to and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I guess they package it all here.</v>

3413
02:30:13.810 --> 02:30:18.810
<v Speaker 3>But think about that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how we're so disconnected from </v>

3414
02:30:18.810 --> 02:30:22.270
<v Speaker 3>our food that when you eat a freaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>burger from trader Joe's,</v>

3415
02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:24.940
<v Speaker 3>it came from for country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making this up.</v>

3416
02:30:24.941 --> 02:30:25.200
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3417
02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think.</v>

3418
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:31.510
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't think you were making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I shouldn't say I'm surprised </v>

3419
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.850
<v Speaker 4>because if it's cheaper to do it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

3420
02:30:31.851 --> 02:30:36.851
<v Speaker 4>that's how they're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In trader Joe's is known for having </v>

3421
02:30:36.851 --> 02:30:40.590
<v Speaker 4>fairly inexpensive food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't say cheap because it's all </v>

3422
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:41.030
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like whole foods,</v>

3423
02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.400
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that are like about </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole foods,</v>

3424
02:30:42.430 --> 02:30:44.540
<v Speaker 4>people say whole foods is expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is expensive,</v>

3425
02:30:44.650 --> 02:30:47.510
<v Speaker 4>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'll show you like the farm where</v>

3426
02:30:47.511 --> 02:30:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the beef is being grown and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose how you want it.</v>

3427
02:30:50.961 --> 02:30:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Like you can choose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I did a bordain show the other day.</v>

3428
02:30:54.591 --> 02:30:59.591
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're hunting pheasants in Montana for </v>

3429
02:30:59.591 --> 02:31:01.160
<v Speaker 4>an upcoming episode and we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about steak and he was like,</v>

3430
02:31:01.161 --> 02:31:02.690
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody says,</v>

3431
02:31:02.691 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have grass fed,</v>

3432
02:31:03.801 --> 02:31:04.430
<v Speaker 4>grass fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3433
02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I like a fatty steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3434
02:31:06.741 --> 02:31:07.750
<v Speaker 4>I like steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>

3435
02:31:07.770 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 4>That eats corn I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it tastes better and a lot of </v>

3436
02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:13.190
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they give you options.</v>

3437
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:18.550
<v Speaker 4>They give you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That whole tiered system shows you </v>

3438
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.550
<v Speaker 4>exactly where the meat is coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it's.</v>

3439
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 4>There's a fucking photo of the farm,</v>

3440
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:23.310
<v Speaker 2>like they show you the farm where these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are being raised in,</v>

3441
02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:28.320
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more expensive to eat sustainable </v>

3442
02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:28.320
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3443
02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.670
<v Speaker 2>It's more expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These hunts that I go on doesn't cheap.</v>

3444
02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:33.510
<v Speaker 2>The effort is way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I,</v>

3445
02:31:33.511 --> 02:31:38.511
<v Speaker 2>if I shoot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna take me five or six days to </v>

3446
02:31:38.511 --> 02:31:43.011
<v Speaker 2>put it all together to get one and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to process to mean Carey and </v>

3447
02:31:43.011 --> 02:31:43.890
<v Speaker 2>freeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you do all of that or do you have</v>

3448
02:31:43.891 --> 02:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume you have somebody helping you.</v>

3449
02:31:45.271 --> 02:31:48.370
<v Speaker 2>It depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them have done all of it on,</v>

3450
02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other ones.</v>

3451
02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 2>If I'm traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm flying.</v>

3452
02:31:51.481 --> 02:31:55.410
<v Speaker 2>What I can do is do a lot of it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring the remaining pieces,</v>

3453
02:31:55.411 --> 02:32:00.411
<v Speaker 2>a quarter it and bring the quarters to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat processor and ask them to turn it </v>

3454
02:32:00.501 --> 02:32:03.930
<v Speaker 2>into steaks or turning into sausage or </v>
<v Speaker 2>have things like that done.</v>

3455
02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:08.700
<v Speaker 2>But the big cuts like the back straps </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tenderloins and stuff like that.</v>

3456
02:32:08.701 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I do all that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heart and the liver.</v>

3457
02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I cut all that stuff out myself and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring it with me.</v>

3458
02:32:13.261 --> 02:32:18.261
<v Speaker 2>I freeze it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to see how crazy the food </v>

3459
02:32:18.261 --> 02:32:18.261
<v Speaker 2>system is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also you could check,</v>

3460
02:32:18.261 --> 02:32:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many documentaries on this,</v>

3461
02:32:19.231 --> 02:32:24.231
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of laws that we have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect the factory farming from simple </v>

3462
02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:28.830
<v Speaker 2>things like having cameras in where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens are illegal,</v>

3463
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:34.110
<v Speaker 2>things that purdue is getting away with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think purdue to me is like the </v>

3464
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:36.210
<v Speaker 2>worst of the worst because if you watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>their commercials,</v>

3465
02:32:36.211 --> 02:32:37.540
<v Speaker 2>and this goes to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about with the,</v>

3466
02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:42.560
<v Speaker 2>with the drugs and the happy people </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the day and then they're having </v>

3467
02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:42.600
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea and killing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3468
02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:43.510
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3469
02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:44.880
<v Speaker 2>the purdue commercials.</v>

3470
02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:47.730
<v Speaker 2>You've got this guy come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hanging out with chickens,</v>

3471
02:32:47.731 --> 02:32:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking to them.</v>

3472
02:32:48.751 --> 02:32:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh there is Bernadette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did they still have.</v>

3473
02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:53.220
<v Speaker 2>They still do all that stupid shit he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3474
02:32:53.221 --> 02:32:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes it's a cartoon and he walks</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

3475
02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.840
<v Speaker 2>What he doesn't say is that he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's about,</v>

3476
02:32:57.990 --> 02:33:02.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Holocaust is going on in </v>

3477
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:04.701
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killing all the chickens and he's </v>

3478
02:33:04.701 --> 02:33:06.051
<v Speaker 2>going to kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have somehow like that's how </v>

3479
02:33:06.051 --> 02:33:09.471
<v Speaker 2>marketing is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't let cameras in to watch them </v>

3480
02:33:09.471 --> 02:33:13.170
<v Speaker 2>rip the beaks off and not let them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal.</v>

3481
02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:15.510
<v Speaker 2>So think about that and can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>

3482
02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.030
<v Speaker 2>What does that have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the government,</v>

3483
02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 2>why would our government that's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have our best interests at heart?</v>

3484
02:33:22.350 --> 02:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the government supposed </v>

3485
02:33:27.350 --> 02:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>to have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they pass that kind of law?</v>

3486
02:33:27.350 --> 02:33:28.620
<v Speaker 2>A lot of money to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3487
02:33:28.621 --> 02:33:32.640
<v Speaker 2>If you want to go to General Motors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to film them putting together a</v>

3488
02:33:32.641 --> 02:33:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Camaro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course love it.</v>

3489
02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.550
<v Speaker 2>They look at what the tour is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we do it,</v>

3490
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no fucking babies are getting </v>

3491
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:46.221
<v Speaker 2>crushed other making Camaro's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to go to a pig farm and </v>

3492
02:33:46.221 --> 02:33:47.280
<v Speaker 2>film it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to jail.</v>

3493
02:33:47.490 --> 02:33:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Like these are new laws that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed because of whistleblowers and </v>

3494
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:53.910
<v Speaker 2>those laws are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's evil.</v>

3495
02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean that should be transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

3496
02:33:56.011 --> 02:33:58.620
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to know exactly where</v>
<v Speaker 2>your food is coming from.</v>

3497
02:33:58.621 --> 02:34:00.390
<v Speaker 2>There's only one way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3498
02:34:00.450 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've done so many things between</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding these animals,</v>

3499
02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:07.110
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of shit that they shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

3500
02:34:07.350 --> 02:34:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drove up?</v>

3501
02:34:08.491 --> 02:34:13.491
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're driving up towards San </v>

3502
02:34:13.491 --> 02:34:13.491
<v Speaker 2>Francisco.</v>

3503
02:34:13.491 --> 02:34:13.980
<v Speaker 2>He passed Harris ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris ranch.</v>

3504
02:34:13.981 --> 02:34:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the largest.</v>

3505
02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:22.080
<v Speaker 2>A meat producer in the United States are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest meat producing ranch in the </v>

3506
02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:23.320
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you pass it,</v>

3507
02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 2>they call it cow shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3508
02:34:24.791 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 2>that's how there is so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stinks of death.</v>

3509
02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean pure death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3510
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:31.930
<v Speaker 2>You've smelled that for a good mile or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

3511
02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:37.380
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see these dirty animals that can </v>

3512
02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:38.080
<v Speaker 2>barely move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3513
02:34:38.081 --> 02:34:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I love meat on my twitter from last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night I had grass fed steaks cooked on a</v>

3514
02:34:42.461 --> 02:34:45.520
<v Speaker 2>whole Himalayan salt plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love me.</v>

3515
02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after that I was like,</v>

3516
02:34:48.430 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is serious.</v>

3517
02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:53.980
<v Speaker 2>That's when I got on at least doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass fed free range thing.</v>

3518
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

3519
02:34:54.741 --> 02:34:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't be part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's about money.</v>

3520
02:34:57.220 --> 02:34:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about money.</v>

3521
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:03.810
<v Speaker 2>It's about volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you have a community of 20 </v>

3522
02:35:03.810 --> 02:35:05.550
<v Speaker 2>million people across Los Angeles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them are growing their own food.</v>

3523
02:35:05.551 --> 02:35:10.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to need food and where's </v>

3524
02:35:10.551 --> 02:35:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that food going to come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to come from somebody else </v>

3525
02:35:11.970 --> 02:35:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that grows up food and we'll how they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to grow that food.</v>

3526
02:35:11.970 --> 02:35:16.200
<v Speaker 2>They're going to grow that food in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most cost effective and efficient way </v>

3527
02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:16.650
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means stuff.</v>

3528
02:35:16.651 --> 02:35:21.651
<v Speaker 2>These fucking animals into these cages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you demand something different </v>

3529
02:35:21.651 --> 02:35:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do demand something different,</v>

3530
02:35:22.151 --> 02:35:27.151
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a higher price </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then these companies aren't </v>

3531
02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:29.671
<v Speaker 2>going to be making much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to have to charge more </v>

3532
02:35:29.671 --> 02:35:29.671
<v Speaker 2>money for the meat and then people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>afford it and then it becomes a problem.</v>

3533
02:35:29.671 --> 02:35:32.410
<v Speaker 2>But if you wanna be able to go to in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out burger or in and out.</v>

3534
02:35:32.410 --> 02:35:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good example because it takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little time,</v>

3535
02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:36.070
<v Speaker 2>but like Jack in the box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull in,</v>

3536
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:41.430
<v Speaker 2>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground up beef sandwich within 30 </v>

3537
02:35:41.430 --> 02:35:41.430
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3538
02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:43.210
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way to do that.</v>

3539
02:35:43.490 --> 02:35:46.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to do it with a massive factory.</v>

3540
02:35:46.210 --> 02:35:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to be churning these fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

3541
02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:51.180
<v Speaker 2>hanging above their ankles and putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>pest piston,</v>

3542
02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through their brain every 30 seconds.</v>

3543
02:35:54.251 --> 02:35:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be chunk,</v>

3544
02:35:55.690 --> 02:35:56.290
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>

3545
02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:58.660
<v Speaker 2>chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be constantly wiping them out</v>

3546
02:35:58.661 --> 02:36:00.040
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>

3547
02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.200
<v Speaker 2>How do you think we get people to wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on this?</v>

3548
02:36:02.201 --> 02:36:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Because what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we covered.</v>

3549
02:36:03.341 --> 02:36:08.341
<v Speaker 2>We covered on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's one of the things that I </v>

3550
02:36:08.341 --> 02:36:08.500
<v Speaker 2>bring on camera to talk about our food </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources and the way that these,</v>

3551
02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:10.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were eating sick animals and then we</v>

3552
02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:11.710
<v Speaker 2>wonder why we're sick.</v>

3553
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's all connected.</v>

3554
02:36:13.871 --> 02:36:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You open up a thing of meat and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

3555
02:36:15.491 --> 02:36:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Why is it great?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you put that in your.</v>

3556
02:36:18.370 --> 02:36:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Why would you put that in your body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is one of those things.</v>

3557
02:36:21.041 --> 02:36:26.041
<v Speaker 2>It's like our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of our discourse in America </v>

3558
02:36:26.041 --> 02:36:30.001
<v Speaker 2>and the level of the nonsense on cable </v>
<v Speaker 2>news and they can keep us distracted </v>

3559
02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:35.190
<v Speaker 2>with Kim Davis issues and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep us distracted with all of this </v>

3560
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:38.941
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily like some big conspiracy of </v>

3561
02:36:38.941 --> 02:36:43.171
<v Speaker 2>keeping us distracted as much as it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we are as humans is this endless </v>

3562
02:36:44.141 --> 02:36:49.141
<v Speaker 2>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just this endless distraction </v>

3563
02:36:49.141 --> 02:36:49.141
<v Speaker 2>and you got a pill for some truth out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3564
02:36:49.141 --> 02:36:52.630
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa Pill for some way to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that works for you,</v>

3565
02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:54.870
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know that they can ever fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's.</v>

3566
02:36:55.030 --> 02:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>We're just in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if it's an endless </v>

3567
02:37:00.030 --> 02:37:03.271
<v Speaker 2>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that life has too many </v>

3568
02:37:03.271 --> 02:37:06.001
<v Speaker 2>variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to consider all </v>

3569
02:37:06.001 --> 02:37:08.581
<v Speaker 2>the variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to build your own </v>

3570
02:37:08.581 --> 02:37:09.961
<v Speaker 2>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to figure out your own </v>

3571
02:37:09.961 --> 02:37:09.961
<v Speaker 2>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run your own wires.</v>

3572
02:37:09.961 --> 02:37:09.961
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to fix your own washing </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine?</v>

3573
02:37:09.961 --> 02:37:11.440
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna build your own washing </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

3574
02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to get it?</v>

3575
02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:15.160
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get the parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to the metal?</v>

3576
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's so</v>

3577
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:21.310
<v Speaker 4>many things involved with living a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable healthy life in 2015 in the </v>

3578
02:37:21.310 --> 02:37:25.790
<v Speaker 4>city that you're going to be responsible</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all aspects or just is it just going</v>

3579
02:37:25.791 --> 02:37:28.220
<v Speaker 4>to be food sourcing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about sewage?</v>

3580
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:33.370
<v Speaker 4>What about waste disposal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do about all that </v>

3581
02:37:33.370 --> 02:37:33.370
<v Speaker 4>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna,</v>

3582
02:37:33.370 --> 02:37:33.370
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look into that or you just going to like</v>

3583
02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:38.560
<v Speaker 4>flush your shit down the toilet and hope</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy at the other end knows what to </v>

3584
02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:41.231
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's essentially what it boils down </v>

3585
02:37:41.231 --> 02:37:42.830
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This super complicated civilization that</v>

3586
02:37:42.831 --> 02:37:44.930
<v Speaker 4>has been created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can say we've created,</v>

3587
02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.200
<v Speaker 4>but it's we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're riding on the momentum of the </v>

3588
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.871
<v Speaker 4>people that came before us and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that came before is oftentimes </v>

3589
02:37:52.871 --> 02:37:52.871
<v Speaker 4>didn't know what the fuck they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

3590
02:37:52.871 --> 02:37:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Didn't plan for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly didn't think that mean when I </v>

3591
02:37:57.610 --> 02:38:00.851
<v Speaker 4>was a kid in the 19 seventies there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like $100,</v>

3592
02:38:02.061 --> 02:38:04.330
<v Speaker 4>million less people in this country </v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

3593
02:38:04.330 --> 02:38:09.330
<v Speaker 4>Just think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about the numbers between like </v>

3594
02:38:09.330 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 4>1975 and 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more than.</v>

3595
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more than $100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million more people just in this kind of</v>

3596
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 4>baby boomers had all those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

3597
02:38:16.611 --> 02:38:20.400
<v Speaker 4>And then there's India that's exploding </v>
<v Speaker 4>population of China.</v>

3598
02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Massive population to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3599
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:25.070
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to limit the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>babies that people have.</v>

3600
02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we live in a very,</v>

3601
02:38:26.601 --> 02:38:31.601
<v Speaker 4>very strange time in that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>awakening to all the problems that have </v>

3602
02:38:32.301 --> 02:38:37.301
<v Speaker 4>been created by this massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and this incredible need for </v>

3603
02:38:37.301 --> 02:38:42.131
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time you're working </v>

3604
02:38:42.131 --> 02:38:44.831
<v Speaker 4>eight hours a day plus plus commuting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus hobbies plus sexual needs and </v>

3605
02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:52.240
<v Speaker 4>entertainment needs and friendships and </v>
<v Speaker 4>every poll and push and oh well you've </v>

3606
02:38:53.151 --> 02:38:55.580
<v Speaker 4>got to have civic responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guess what,</v>

3607
02:38:55.581 --> 02:38:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need you for jury duty.</v>

3608
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:58.610
<v Speaker 4>You can't catch up.</v>

3609
02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>

3610
02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:05.050
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we operate on this fucking constant </v>

3611
02:39:05.050 --> 02:39:07.571
<v Speaker 4>momentum with very little quiet time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's things that I love to this thing.</v>

3612
02:39:08.490 --> 02:39:13.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what I loved the most about those</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensory deprivation tank because I get </v>

3613
02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:15.500
<v Speaker 4>that quiet time that you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3614
02:39:15.501 --> 02:39:17.340
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get time for reflection.</v>

3615
02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:18.950
<v Speaker 4>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often are you doing it?</v>

3616
02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have it in my house.</v>

3617
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I do it all the time.</v>

3618
02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:23.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is really cool.</v>

3619
02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everyone should do it.</v>

3620
02:39:25.851 --> 02:39:30.851
<v Speaker 4>Just to try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to feel what it's like to just be </v>

3621
02:39:30.851 --> 02:39:31.040
<v Speaker 4>alone with your thoughts because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only time you're actually alone with</v>

3622
02:39:31.041 --> 02:39:33.290
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body isn't even registering.</v>

3623
02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Is there a lock on that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3624
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:37.130
<v Speaker 4>I would be freaking out the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3625
02:39:38.090 --> 02:39:39.410
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't make sense,</v>

3626
02:39:39.411 --> 02:39:42.050
<v Speaker 4>but like would there be some reason that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could lock?</v>

3627
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:43.020
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3628
02:39:43.021 --> 02:39:48.021
<v Speaker 4>I was not even a latch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not even a door handle or </v>

3629
02:39:48.021 --> 02:39:48.220
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just pushes open and push his clothes</v>

3630
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:49.160
<v Speaker 4>got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long do you go in there?</v>

3631
02:39:49.161 --> 02:39:50.090
<v Speaker 4>For?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as I want.</v>

3632
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Usually at least an hour usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes two hours.</v>

3633
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:56.690
<v Speaker 4>I know for the first 20 minutes of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>

3634
02:39:56.691 --> 02:39:57.800
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this thing locked?</v>

3635
02:39:57.860 --> 02:39:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Did I get lost?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it would be a lot.</v>

3636
02:39:59.630 --> 02:40:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Even if I was alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would just be fearing.</v>

3637
02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:04.040
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd get used to it.</v>

3638
02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:05.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not scary at all.</v>

3639
02:40:05.871 --> 02:40:07.550
<v Speaker 4>It's relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is one of those run yet?</v>

3640
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:10.760
<v Speaker 4>It's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A cheap one for like.</v>

3641
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a company called Zen </v>

3642
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:16.410
<v Speaker 4>float that makes a small personal one </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Duncan has in his house.</v>

3643
02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I think that one is still fairly </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive,</v>

3644
02:40:19.261 --> 02:40:23.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's like 1500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the top of the line.</v>

3645
02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Bad Mama Jama float lab version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like 30 grand.</v>

3646
02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really expensive.</v>

3647
02:40:29.161 --> 02:40:34.161
<v Speaker 4>But mine is seven feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine feet wide and it looks like a meat </v>

3648
02:40:34.161 --> 02:40:38.121
<v Speaker 4>locker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it looks like a gigantic </v>

3649
02:40:38.121 --> 02:40:38.121
<v Speaker 4>freezer that you step into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's perfect.</v>

3650
02:40:38.121 --> 02:40:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see the compound that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>live on.</v>

3651
02:40:39.850 --> 02:40:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's a lot of cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the chickens slash and there's </v>

3652
02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:45.540
<v Speaker 2>elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3653
02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before archery range because that's 100 </v>

3654
02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.230
<v Speaker 2>yards in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rubber pigs and rubber elk and I have an</v>

3655
02:40:53.231 --> 02:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>ikea couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3656
02:40:55.970 --> 02:40:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I built it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

3657
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to brag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an l pretty,</v>

3658
02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:01.950
<v Speaker 2>pretty sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this thing that was a.</v>

3659
02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about people they </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience more satisfaction in the </v>

3660
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.851
<v Speaker 2>ownership of things like Ikea because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not like good </v>

3661
02:41:11.851 --> 02:41:13.090
<v Speaker 2>furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the best furniture.</v>

3662
02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:18.270
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they put it together </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves gives them a sense of </v>

3663
02:41:18.270 --> 02:41:20.470
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction that I think we're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing and part of our culture,</v>

3664
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:25.630
<v Speaker 2>like someone who built their own house </v>
<v Speaker 2>and built their own furniture and they </v>

3665
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.690
<v Speaker 2>sit in their own house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own furniture probably gets like a</v>

3666
02:41:25.691 --> 02:41:27.970
<v Speaker 2>deep feeling of satisfaction about that.</v>

3667
02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you as someone that has </v>

3668
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.030
<v Speaker 2>almost all Ikea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3669
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's taken me.</v>

3670
02:41:33.191 --> 02:41:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 39.</v>

3671
02:41:34.841 --> 02:41:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I started standing up and right when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got out of college,</v>

3672
02:41:37.631 --> 02:41:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Ninety eight had radio shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's been a long,</v>

3673
02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:41.800
<v Speaker 2>long journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally,</v>

3674
02:41:41.801 --> 02:41:46.801
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in this past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really in the past six months and </v>

3675
02:41:46.801 --> 02:41:50.491
<v Speaker 2>only in the last couple months that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really feel like I'm sort of on the </v>

3676
02:41:50.491 --> 02:41:52.531
<v Speaker 2>other side for the first time and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that feeling never goes away and I </v>

3677
02:41:52.531 --> 02:41:52.531
<v Speaker 2>probably just jinxed it on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what went well.</v>

3678
02:41:52.531 --> 02:41:54.560
<v Speaker 2>The other side meaning like I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3679
02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm here somewhere like I'm in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

3680
02:41:57.830 --> 02:42:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I really have something and know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying and know what I'm doing.</v>

3681
02:42:01.570 --> 02:42:06.570
<v Speaker 2>And being rewarded for it financially </v>
<v Speaker 2>and personally and by my audience and </v>

3682
02:42:08.171 --> 02:42:08.380
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3683
02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:10.480
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not rolling in dough by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by any stretch.</v>

3684
02:42:10.481 --> 02:42:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make six figures but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing good.</v>

3685
02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not scared.</v>

3686
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:15.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3687
02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:17.050
<v Speaker 2>But the fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always there.</v>

3688
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:19.270
<v Speaker 2>The fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

3689
02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably never leaves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

3690
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who's on a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitcom.</v>

3691
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:27.940
<v Speaker 2>She's making a boat load of money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she talks to me about it all the time.</v>

3692
02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:30.510
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be gone tomorrow and then what?</v>

3693
02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:32.170
<v Speaker 2>And then what am I left it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have some money now,</v>

3694
02:42:32.171 --> 02:42:33.100
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3695
02:42:33.130 --> 02:42:34.840
<v Speaker 2>what am I left with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3696
02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:39.760
<v Speaker 2>but I do aspire my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my house is pretty much 90 percent Ikea.</v>

3697
02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to get to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3698
02:42:42.551 --> 02:42:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to the point when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3699
02:42:44.561 --> 02:42:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like my couch is Ikea.</v>

3700
02:42:48.641 --> 02:42:50.340
<v Speaker 2>My bed is Ikea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my futons,</v>

3701
02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Ikea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Shit in my kitchen is Ikea.</v>

3702
02:42:53.831 --> 02:42:58.831
<v Speaker 2>Like that would be to me success like </v>
<v Speaker 2>designer furniture.</v>

3703
02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:01.870
<v Speaker 2>But because the ikea couch more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is,</v>

3704
02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.610
<v Speaker 2>is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>

3705
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:04.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3706
02:43:04.690 --> 02:43:06.490
<v Speaker 2>That might be what my neck hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because of my.</v>

3707
02:43:06.491 --> 02:43:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I be that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3708
02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:09.160
<v Speaker 2>But that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3709
02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 2>but you know like I'm but also like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

3710
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:15.250
<v Speaker 4>a lot of truth in that like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's sort of started working</v>

3711
02:43:15.251 --> 02:43:16.810
<v Speaker 4>and I was just looking around my place </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day.</v>

3712
02:43:16.811 --> 02:43:21.811
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe the next phase will be like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit more something.</v>

3713
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Well I feel like it's a rabbit hole that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>

3714
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:29.550
<v Speaker 4>You have to be really careful when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>step in because it will suck your time </v>

3715
02:43:29.550 --> 02:43:31.240
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This hunting thing suck my time up.</v>

3716
02:43:31.241 --> 02:43:34.000
<v Speaker 4>If I went into the manufacturing my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>furniture thing,</v>

3717
02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:39.400
<v Speaker 4>like doubting my own wood and milling it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so and unfortunately I have friends </v>

3718
02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.650
<v Speaker 4>that are professional woodworkers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3719
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know like that.</v>

3720
02:43:44.291 --> 02:43:48.580
<v Speaker 4>It is possible to learn all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then build furniture.</v>

3721
02:43:48.581 --> 02:43:50.440
<v Speaker 4>You could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you'd have to say,</v>

3722
02:43:50.441 --> 02:43:52.810
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well am I going to weave my own cloth to</v>

3723
02:43:52.811 --> 02:43:55.090
<v Speaker 4>cover this furniture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You turn it on your own butter.</v>

3724
02:43:55.090 --> 02:43:55.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we talking about?</v>

3725
02:43:55.871 --> 02:44:00.871
<v Speaker 4>Going to use the elk that I killed for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the leather that covers the couch and </v>

3726
02:44:00.871 --> 02:44:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to kill quite a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals to populate my house.</v>

3727
02:44:02.771 --> 02:44:04.510
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing would be a blood bath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuts,</v>

3728
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:06.280
<v Speaker 4>a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of work.</v>

3729
02:44:06.310 --> 02:44:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Or am I going to get one of them crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Indian weaves,</v>

3730
02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:10.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you'd like to have the yarn,</v>

3731
02:44:10.781 --> 02:44:13.690
<v Speaker 4>you pull it through and you push it down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and make your own cloth.</v>

3732
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of fucking words.</v>

3733
02:44:15.310 --> 02:44:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like you're there and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

3734
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:22.801
<v Speaker 4>that place on the other side where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've sort of built what you wanted to </v>

3735
02:44:22.801 --> 02:44:26.011
<v Speaker 4>build and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your life and your work and all of </v>

3736
02:44:26.011 --> 02:44:26.430
<v Speaker 4>the sort of lined up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3737
02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:29.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3738
02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:33.040
<v Speaker 4>I might think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't worry about money.</v>

3739
02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about money.</v>

3740
02:44:34.570 --> 02:44:37.420
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worry about work in,</v>

3741
02:44:37.470 --> 02:44:39.730
<v Speaker 4>in that I want to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything I'm doing is good.</v>

3742
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.000
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's podcasts or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up or whether it's doing my </v>

3743
02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:48.361
<v Speaker 4>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always want to make sure that I'm not </v>

3744
02:44:48.361 --> 02:44:49.900
<v Speaker 4>doing bad stuff and that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I have done something that's not that</v>

3745
02:44:49.901 --> 02:44:54.901
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I make sure that that doesn't happen </v>

3746
02:44:54.901 --> 02:44:54.901
<v Speaker 4>ever again or that if it does happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

3747
02:44:54.901 --> 02:44:55.720
<v Speaker 4>I learned from that one too and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets better even there.</v>

3748
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:57.400
<v Speaker 4>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3749
02:44:57.420 --> 02:45:02.420
<v Speaker 4>it's not like shit I gotta pay my bills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do remember that feeling bad and I</v>

3750
02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:05.830
<v Speaker 4>also remember the moment that that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

3751
02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:09.820
<v Speaker 4>How free it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I got a development deal when I was</v>

3752
02:45:09.821 --> 02:45:12.470
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many years in economy,</v>

3753
02:45:12.490 --> 02:45:17.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's like 93 and I got a big check </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Disney of all people and all of a </v>

3754
02:45:17.741 --> 02:45:21.040
<v Speaker 4>sudden I didn't have to worry about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was paying my rent all of a sudden for</v>

3755
02:45:21.041 --> 02:45:26.041
<v Speaker 4>at least the next year or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a couple of years it was paid and it </v>

3756
02:45:26.041 --> 02:45:30.130
<v Speaker 4>was like this silence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this weight.</v>

3757
02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 4>Just literally a physical weight lifted </v>
<v Speaker 4>off my shoulders.</v>

3758
02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.320
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought about it and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3759
02:45:35.321 --> 02:45:37.690
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people never get to that place.</v>

3760
02:45:37.691 --> 02:45:40.030
<v Speaker 4>They live their life from cradle to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grave,</v>

3761
02:45:40.031 --> 02:45:43.060
<v Speaker 4>constantly under the pressure of bills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check to check,</v>

3762
02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:48.300
<v Speaker 4>and that that freedom of not worrying </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your bills is massive and people </v>

3763
02:45:49.361 --> 02:45:54.361
<v Speaker 4>trip themselves up by putting themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>in debt and by getting in over their </v>

3764
02:45:54.361 --> 02:45:57.871
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving themselves a bunch of shit that </v>

3765
02:45:57.871 --> 02:45:57.970
<v Speaker 4>they don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they have to pay for it or they buy</v>

3766
02:45:57.971 --> 02:46:00.370
<v Speaker 4>it on credit and they have to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

3767
02:46:00.371 --> 02:46:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll figure out a way and that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure is overwhelming for people.</v>

3768
02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:10.440
<v Speaker 4>When that pressure went away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was replaced by the pressure to try </v>

3769
02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:10.440
<v Speaker 4>to do good stuff,</v>

3770
02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:12.620
<v Speaker 2>to try to do things that I can be proud </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3771
02:46:12.621 --> 02:46:14.810
<v Speaker 2>to try to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you doing that already?</v>

3772
02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was trying to do it and I was </v>

3773
02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:21.821
<v Speaker 2>worried about making money at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and as soon as the worry about </v>

3774
02:46:21.821 --> 02:46:23.780
<v Speaker 2>making money kind of goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then your.</v>

3775
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:26.990
<v Speaker 2>You're left with a pure sense of why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

3776
02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:30.050
<v Speaker 2>So isn't that for all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>now we put out there,</v>

3777
02:46:30.051 --> 02:46:30.980
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

3778
02:46:30.981 --> 02:46:32.090
<v Speaker 2>audio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

3779
02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Owning your brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the.</v>

3780
02:46:33.351 --> 02:46:37.560
<v Speaker 2>All the things that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I hate it to a boy on your brand.</v>

3781
02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:41.300
<v Speaker 2>People say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to run from them.</v>

3782
02:46:42.090 --> 02:46:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you manage your brand?</v>

3783
02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Somebody asked me to do a seminar on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really recently.</v>

3784
02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not worried about money,</v>

3785
02:46:48.231 --> 02:46:49.550
<v Speaker 2>so I guess he didn't have to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3786
02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you make much money on </v>
<v Speaker 2>those seminars.</v>

3787
02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay,</v>

3788
02:46:52.410 --> 02:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets money?</v>

3789
02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:56.600
<v Speaker 2>The people that run the seminar to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pimps.</v>

3790
02:46:56.601 --> 02:46:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3791
02:46:57.330 --> 02:46:58.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3792
02:46:58.550 --> 02:47:00.380
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty of all this stuff.</v>

3793
02:47:00.381 --> 02:47:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So you built this whole thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're free.</v>

3794
02:47:03.810 --> 02:47:05.210
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you answered it yourself,</v>

3795
02:47:05.410 --> 02:47:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very unique time for people </v>

3796
02:47:10.410 --> 02:47:13.721
<v Speaker 2>like us because finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this exists so that we can </v>

3797
02:47:13.721 --> 02:47:14.280
<v Speaker 2>control our destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3798
02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:19.400

3799

<v Speaker 2>really good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you said at the beginning.</v>

3800
02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:19.400
<v Speaker 2>They let me do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3801
02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:21.230
<v Speaker 2>literally they sat me down the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the show started,</v>

3802
02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:23.810
<v Speaker 2>an executive who I'd never met in person</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3803
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Said he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one thing to say to you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

3826
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>

3827
02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear better numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>

3828
02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to get better at ovaries do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually this is the first deal that</v>

3829
02:48:22.731 --> 02:48:27.731
<v Speaker 2>I ever had my agent close for me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd always done even my Sirius </v>

3830
02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:29.830
<v Speaker 2>xm deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did myself and my podcast deals.</v>

3831
02:48:29.850 --> 02:48:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd always done everything and when my </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent did this,</v>

3832
02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:38.260
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize how hard it was going </v>

3833
02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:38.720
<v Speaker 2>to be for me to let go and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3834
02:48:38.721 --> 02:48:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to trust you to actually do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deal now.</v>

3835
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:45.110
<v Speaker 2>That was really hard for me to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3836
02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

3837
02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:50.820
<v Speaker 2>But that's how you mature in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotTa have a good agent.</v>

3838
02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I told you my issue that I had with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent when dementia thing went down,</v>

3839
02:48:55.260 --> 02:49:00.260
<v Speaker 2>but I've had the same manager scrub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just a kid in my early twenties to</v>

3840
02:49:00.711 --> 02:49:04.190
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck I was doing that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to since I was an open mic.</v>

3841
02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I got really lucky.</v>

3842
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:11.830
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found me in Boston when I was make </v>

3843
02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:14.571
<v Speaker 2>people laugh and he saw something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought and we worked together ever </v>

3844
02:49:14.571 --> 02:49:16.440
<v Speaker 2>since and we've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of my best friends.</v>

3845
02:49:16.441 --> 02:49:18.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a great friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3846
02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:21.930
<v Speaker 2>but because people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people always confuse her to the</v>

3847
02:49:21.931 --> 02:49:25.560
<v Speaker 2>manage your aging thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A manager really is sorta like it.</v>

3848
02:49:25.561 --> 02:49:29.670
<v Speaker 2>A lot of respects should be your friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your guru and you're sort of helping</v>

3849
02:49:29.671 --> 02:49:31.850
<v Speaker 2>you down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agent is getting you gates,</v>

3850
02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:37.040
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have friends that have just </v>

3851
02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:37.950
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their managers and when you're not doing</v>

3852
02:49:37.951 --> 02:49:40.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manager can be a real hard to get on</v>

3853
02:49:40.711 --> 02:49:42.270
<v Speaker 2>the fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>codependent relationship.</v>

3854
02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:47.510
<v Speaker 2>You're saying the people in this town </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be fair weather friends can't </v>

3855
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:49.680
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're almost out of time,</v>

3856
02:49:49.681 --> 02:49:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but I really.</v>

3857
02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Before we leave a half to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about one thing that you told me that I </v>

3858
02:49:55.220 --> 02:49:55.330
<v Speaker 2>think is when you do start doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your.</v>

3859
02:49:55.350 --> 02:50:00.350
<v Speaker 2>They're your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's an incestuous reared fucking </v>

3860
02:50:00.350 --> 02:50:04.041
<v Speaker 2>very strange codependent relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that people in this town </v>

3861
02:50:04.041 --> 02:50:07.730
<v Speaker 2>can be fair weather friends that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

3862
02:50:07.731 --> 02:50:09.090
<v Speaker 2>we're almost out of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really,</v>

3863
02:50:09.091 --> 02:50:14.091
<v Speaker 2>before we leave a half to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about one thing that you told me that I </v>

3864
02:50:14.091 --> 02:50:17.061
<v Speaker 2>think is incredibly fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You came out literally the to someone </v>

3865
02:50:18.031 --> 02:50:21.960
<v Speaker 2>for the very first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day before September 11th,</v>

3866
02:50:22.170 --> 02:50:26.460
<v Speaker 2>the night it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about midnight of September 11th,</v>

3867
02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:29.670
<v Speaker 2>so meaning September 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just rolled into September 11th.</v>

3868
02:50:29.970 --> 02:50:34.970
<v Speaker 2>The first person ever came out to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant comic who you've never heard </v>

3869
02:50:34.970 --> 02:50:34.970
<v Speaker 2>of and I don't even know what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

3870
02:50:34.970 --> 02:50:35.700
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Singer,</v>

3871
02:50:35.701 --> 02:50:37.380
<v Speaker 2>was one of the best comics that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew.</v>

3872
02:50:37.380 --> 02:50:40.470
<v Speaker 2>We worked for years together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sky was wickedly funny.</v>

3873
02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I think he lives in Columbia now or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3874
02:50:42.371 --> 02:50:43.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3875
02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:46.200
<v Speaker 2>he was gay and he was so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in a way,</v>

3876
02:50:46.201 --> 02:50:51.201
<v Speaker 2>I was ahead of my time in terms of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>out as a comic that doesn't necessarily </v>

3877
02:50:51.391 --> 02:50:56.391
<v Speaker 2>play into every stereotype and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy was really ahead of it because </v>

3878
02:50:56.391 --> 02:50:56.850
<v Speaker 2>he was 15 years older than me and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it already.</v>

3879
02:50:57.390 --> 02:50:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in the time square subway.</v>

3880
02:50:59.101 --> 02:51:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I was going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived on the upper east at the time.</v>

3881
02:51:01.171 --> 02:51:06.171
<v Speaker 2>I was walking to the shuttle thing to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get on the east side and I had.</v>

3882
02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I was just a fucking complete mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3883
02:51:11.170 --> 02:51:16.170
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly hard to live one life to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live one life on this planet is a hard </v>

3884
02:51:16.261 --> 02:51:21.261
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try living too at the same time and </v>

3885
02:51:21.261 --> 02:51:24.231
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was doing because I had my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that everyone knew and then I had </v>

3886
02:51:24.231 --> 02:51:25.740
<v Speaker 2>this secret life where I was out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3887
02:51:25.741 --> 02:51:29.520
<v Speaker 2>hooking up and I was lying to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

3888
02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Even though I never intended to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be somewhere and I bumped into a</v>

3889
02:51:33.511 --> 02:51:35.700
<v Speaker 2>friend and I'd be with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gay person,</v>

3890
02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:36.540
<v Speaker 2>and I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3891
02:51:36.541 --> 02:51:38.610
<v Speaker 2>that's my cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just,</v>

3892
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:41.190
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never really,</v>

3893
02:51:41.191 --> 02:51:46.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean I never intended to lie to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it just became this really horrible </v>

3894
02:51:47.041 --> 02:51:52.041
<v Speaker 2>game of cat and mouse and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and I was smoking pot and all </v>

3895
02:51:52.041 --> 02:51:53.200
<v Speaker 2>this shit anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3896
02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:54.540
<v Speaker 2>and then when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it really,</v>

3897
02:51:54.541 --> 02:51:55.590
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said earlier,</v>

3898
02:51:55.591 --> 02:52:00.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was the fuel for good comedy </v>

3899
02:52:00.591 --> 02:52:03.591
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually it just started </v>

3900
02:52:03.591 --> 02:52:03.591
<v Speaker 2>sputtering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I wasn't happy,</v>

3901
02:52:03.591 --> 02:52:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

3902
02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 2>couldn't bring those things to the stage</v>

3903
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.900
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just my life was a fucking disaster.</v>

3904
02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about midnight,</v>

3905
02:52:11.050 --> 02:52:13.990
<v Speaker 3>just eight hours before the first plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit,</v>

3906
02:52:13.991 --> 02:52:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the time square subway station </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my friend.</v>

3907
02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I told him I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he realized even though </v>

3908
02:52:21.660 --> 02:52:22.660
<v Speaker 3>this guy knew me for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he realized that.</v>

3909
02:52:22.900 --> 02:52:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3910
02:52:23.951 --> 02:52:25.780
<v Speaker 3>you're the first person I'm telling or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3911
02:52:25.781 --> 02:52:30.781
<v Speaker 3>Like I just said it and we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked for two or three minutes and </v>

3912
02:52:30.781 --> 02:52:31.130
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3913
02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to you later this week or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3914
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:38.790
<v Speaker 3>And I go home and I woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I turned on the TV in America is under </v>

3915
02:52:38.951 --> 02:52:42.280
<v Speaker 3>attack and I kid you not like I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking a lot of pot at the time.</v>

3916
02:52:42.281 --> 02:52:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I was not mentally right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wasn't.</v>

3917
02:52:44.621 --> 02:52:49.621
<v Speaker 3>I remember probably a few weeks before </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was walking to the subway and by </v>

3918
02:52:49.751 --> 02:52:53.010
<v Speaker 3>living two lives I felt I felt like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy person.</v>

3919
02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way I can describe it was I </v>

3920
02:52:58.020 --> 02:52:59.821
<v Speaker 3>remember walking down second avenue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like all the buildings were </v>

3921
02:53:00.251 --> 02:53:04.300
<v Speaker 3>shaking like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt centered like I was okay,</v>

3922
02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:07.510
<v Speaker 3>but literally you'd felt like the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>was being ripped apart.</v>

3923
02:53:07.540 --> 02:53:12.540
<v Speaker 3>That was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the level of disconnect I had with </v>

3924
02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:13.990
<v Speaker 3>reality at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3925
02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:19.020
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can't express your love </v>

3926
02:53:19.020 --> 02:53:19.020
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't,</v>

3927
02:53:19.020 --> 02:53:23.040
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we started this whole thing </v>

3928
02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:24.781
<v Speaker 3>talking about all these guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacked and working out all the time and </v>

3929
02:53:24.781 --> 02:53:24.781
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3930
02:53:24.781 --> 02:53:28.680
<v Speaker 3>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very sad to me because these are </v>

3931
02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:29.950
<v Speaker 3>people who could not express a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>human thing in a proper way.</v>

3932
02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:35.160
<v Speaker 3>So they end up acting out at 45 in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they should have acted when they </v>

3933
02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:38.731
<v Speaker 3>were 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partying and having a great Milo </v>

3934
02:53:38.731 --> 02:53:38.731
<v Speaker 3>Yiannopoulos.</v>

3935
02:53:38.731 --> 02:53:41.110
<v Speaker 3>What do you have against a math?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3936
02:53:41.111 --> 02:53:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you had on a couple of weeks ago and</v>

3937
02:53:42.731 --> 02:53:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I had them on the day or two after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we argued about that.</v>

3938
02:53:45.790 --> 02:53:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Me As the liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay married liberal who's for that </v>

3939
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:52.540
<v Speaker 3>traditional thing and him as the off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>

3940
02:53:52.541 --> 02:53:57.541
<v Speaker 3>British gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative who's against gay marriage </v>

3941
02:53:57.541 --> 02:53:58.090
<v Speaker 3>because he wants to talk about drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>partying and sex and whatever.</v>

3942
02:53:58.091 --> 02:54:00.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I love talking to him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all honesty.</v>

3943
02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:04.990
<v Speaker 3>And I really enjoyed talking to Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trolling and so many different ways</v>

3944
02:54:04.991 --> 02:54:07.300
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously winking at you the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3945
02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:10.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the audience is aware of it.</v>

3946
02:54:10.331 --> 02:54:12.310
<v Speaker 3>And if he was sitting right here he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't answer,</v>

3947
02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:13.750
<v Speaker 3>isn't aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

3948
02:54:13.870 --> 02:54:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are idiots.</v>

3949
02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:19.340
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I woke up and I,</v>

3950
02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I kid you not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

3951
02:54:21.101 --> 02:54:26.101
<v Speaker 3>I kid you not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it had something to do with </v>

3952
02:54:26.101 --> 02:54:29.131
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were like the world was </v>

3953
02:54:29.131 --> 02:54:32.400
<v Speaker 3>attacked or we were under attack because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I finally express this thing that I</v>

3954
02:54:32.401 --> 02:54:34.330
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secret that I had had that it was so</v>

3955
02:54:34.331 --> 02:54:38.410
<v Speaker 3>bad that being out caused the world to </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse.</v>

3956
02:54:38.770 --> 02:54:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I know that even saying that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always told this publicly maybe </v>

3957
02:54:43.770 --> 02:54:44.830
<v Speaker 3>twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it sounds completely fucking insane</v>

3958
02:54:44.831 --> 02:54:45.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

3959
02:54:45.971 --> 02:54:50.971
<v Speaker 3>And it is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like that's where my head was at </v>

3960
02:54:50.971 --> 02:54:51.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interestingly after that,</v>

3961
02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:56.670
<v Speaker 3>the way I dealt with coming out was I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would tell someone and then I would get </v>

3962
02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:57.870
<v Speaker 3>this little burst of feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would suddenly [inaudible] you.</v>

3963
02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:01.270
<v Speaker 3>I was like constricting my heart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I would tell someone it would,</v>

3964
02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:03.110
<v Speaker 3>it would open up a little and I'd feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and I could.</v>

3965
02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I really could feel like I could breathe</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

3966
02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:10.360
<v Speaker 3>like really felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would wait until that </v>

3967
02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:11.210
<v Speaker 3>pressure would start building again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I would wait months and then I</v>

3968
02:55:11.211 --> 02:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>would tell someone and then I would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this over the course of like two years.</v>

3969
02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:16.790
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3970
02:55:16.791 --> 02:55:21.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I tell somebody this thing </v>

3971
02:55:21.791 --> 02:55:22.610
<v Speaker 3>that I think is horrible and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much okay and I feel better,</v>

3972
02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta end this,</v>

3973
02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:25.800
<v Speaker 3>it's time to end this now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3974
02:55:25.850 --> 02:55:28.100
<v Speaker 3>that's basically when I told the </v>
<v Speaker 3>remaining people.</v>

3975
02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:33.120
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird secret because the people </v>

3976
02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:36.230
<v Speaker 3>that do care that don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not worth knowing and nobody,</v>

3977
02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:38.630
<v Speaker 3>literally nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody that I told,</v>

3978
02:55:38.810 --> 02:55:40.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad struggled for a little bit or you</v>

3979
02:55:40.791 --> 02:55:41.480
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3980
02:55:41.481 --> 02:55:42.980
<v Speaker 3>This and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My a lot.</v>

3981
02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:46.100
<v Speaker 3>The thing that mostly people got was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nobody believed I was gay.</v>

3982
02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.330
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mate,</v>

3983
02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:50.810
<v Speaker 3>will you play basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You play basketball,</v>

3984
02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3985
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:55.100
<v Speaker 3>So nobody could believe like they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't seem gay.</v>

3986
02:55:55.101 --> 02:55:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't like to dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't dance.</v>

3987
02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I learned my dancing from Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's my move,</v>

3988
02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:05.270
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of that.</v>

3989
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:08.000
<v Speaker 3>So that was the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was just sideswiped.</v>

3990
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:09.740
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of times people will say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3991
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:11.620
<v Speaker 3>you're straight or you're straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting or saying,</v>

3992
02:56:11.621 --> 02:56:13.230
<v Speaker 3>which in the gay community is thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

3993
02:56:13.231 --> 02:56:14.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like this great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3994
02:56:14.661 --> 02:56:16.400
<v Speaker 3>they're a pure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight acting your masculine.</v>

3995
02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:17.960
<v Speaker 3>It's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>

3996
02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't take it that way because every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time someone says it to me,</v>

3997
02:56:21.351 --> 02:56:23.480
<v Speaker 3>it makes me feel like a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3998
02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Like why am I.</v>

3999
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I am who I am.</v>

4000
02:56:26.721 --> 02:56:28.250
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

4001
02:56:28.251 --> 02:56:33.251
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had gay sex last night after I </v>

4002
02:56:33.251 --> 02:56:33.830
<v Speaker 3>had that grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4003
02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:36.630
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm married to a guy there.</v>

4004
02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:41.640
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a gay person that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty gay married to a guy would say </v>

4005
02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:42.710
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I realized.</v>

4006
02:56:42.711 --> 02:56:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4007
02:56:43.021 --> 02:56:44.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm marrying this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess,</v>

4008
02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:48.080
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>

4009
02:56:48.081 --> 02:56:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess,</v>

4010
02:56:49.791 --> 02:56:50.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4011
02:56:50.430 --> 02:56:52.210
<v Speaker 3>turning it back now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4012
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:54.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a phase I was renting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4013
02:56:54.551 --> 02:56:56.190
<v Speaker 3>This is a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really like,</v>

4014
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dragging out this phase thing,</v>

4015
02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:02.950
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that if I felt better </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I told people that,</v>

4016
02:57:03.370 --> 02:57:08.370
<v Speaker 3>that there had to be some value in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that I couldn't understand </v>

4017
02:57:08.370 --> 02:57:08.370
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4018
02:57:08.370 --> 02:57:12.320
<v Speaker 3>but to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the straight acting like it means </v>

4019
02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:14.861
<v Speaker 3>nothing to me when I meet guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely flaming or if I meet guys </v>

4020
02:57:14.861 --> 02:57:15.950
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'd have no idea.</v>

4021
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Like I like people based on their values</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their sense of humor and like shit </v>

4022
02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:25.511
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never asked to all people that matter </v>

4023
02:57:25.511 --> 02:57:25.511
<v Speaker 3>as as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4024
02:57:25.511 --> 02:57:28.900
<v Speaker 3>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way to bring this all </v>

4025
02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:30.971
<v Speaker 3>around because that gets away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>judging people on what you're supposed </v>

4026
02:57:30.971 --> 02:57:34.331
<v Speaker 3>to think about them and all that social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice warrior and regressive bullshit </v>

4027
02:57:34.331 --> 02:57:37.720
<v Speaker 3>versus judging people on the content of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their character and also gets back to </v>

4028
02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:42.071
<v Speaker 3>what we're saying earlier that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just being aware socially being a </v>

4029
02:57:42.071 --> 02:57:45.920
<v Speaker 3>good person to communicate with versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>being socially retarded and just looking</v>

4030
02:57:45.921 --> 02:57:47.980
<v Speaker 3>for those Ben Affleck Brownie moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4031
02:57:48.270 --> 02:57:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Let me toss in one other thing that sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ties into this really nicely,</v>

4032
02:57:51.231 --> 02:57:54.470
<v Speaker 3>so one one time when I was on the young </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turks,</v>

4033
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:59.870
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not gonna mention names here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was on and they were showing a </v>

4034
02:57:59.870 --> 02:58:03.280
<v Speaker 3>clip from Fox News and they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how the host that he was such a </v>

4035
02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:03.480
<v Speaker 3>token black guy.</v>

4036
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:06.640
<v Speaker 3>He was such a token black guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually know the guy.</v>

4037
02:58:06.700 --> 02:58:07.740
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Webb,</v>

4038
02:58:07.741 --> 02:58:10.170
<v Speaker 3>who I used to work with at Sirius Xm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good friends with him.</v>

4039
02:58:10.171 --> 02:58:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I had dinner with him last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is a black conservative.</v>

4040
02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:15.990
<v Speaker 3>He is a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know him.</v>

4041
02:58:15.991 --> 02:58:20.991
<v Speaker 3>I know what this guy believes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He spends hours on the air every day </v>

4042
02:58:20.991 --> 02:58:23.040
<v Speaker 3>professing his beliefs and that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another.</v>

4043
02:58:23.041 --> 02:58:25.080
<v Speaker 3>This happened a little bit after that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole Sam Harris thing,</v>

4044
02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:30.320
<v Speaker 3>but that was another moment when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized how perverse this whole </v>

4045
02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:34.250
<v Speaker 3>progressive thing is that here you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left that are supposed to </v>

4046
02:58:34.250 --> 02:58:38.751
<v Speaker 3>be about ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the color of that guy's skin </v>

4047
02:58:38.751 --> 02:58:38.751
<v Speaker 3>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4048
02:58:38.751 --> 02:58:40.860
<v Speaker 3>because you don't believe what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to believe.</v>

4049
02:58:40.861 --> 02:58:43.710
<v Speaker 3>As a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a token black,</v>

4050
02:58:44.380 --> 02:58:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've all done that,</v>

4051
02:58:45.421 --> 02:58:50.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they showed like a Republican </v>

4052
02:58:50.421 --> 02:58:50.421
<v Speaker 3>convention and there's one black I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

4053
02:58:50.421 --> 02:58:53.100
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that's actually racism </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was.</v>

4054
02:58:53.130 --> 02:58:58.130
<v Speaker 3>That was really a seminal moment for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really changed my thinking because </v>

4055
02:58:58.130 --> 02:58:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

4056
02:58:58.130 --> 02:59:02.631
<v Speaker 3>I know this person personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a friend of mine and I know he </v>

4057
02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:04.050
<v Speaker 3>believes he's not doing this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a token black.</v>

4058
02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:06.930
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what he believes,</v>

4059
02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:10.470
<v Speaker 3>and you as the on the left are pointing </v>
<v Speaker 3>at this guy and saying,</v>

4060
02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:12.990
<v Speaker 3>you're different than what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be black guy,</v>

4061
02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:16.230
<v Speaker 3>so you must be a token or you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle tom or a sell out or something.</v>

4062
02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:19.260
<v Speaker 3>And also all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have the gay stuff,</v>

4063
02:59:19.261 --> 02:59:23.730
<v Speaker 3>the social justice or either the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive stuff like judge people based</v>

4064
02:59:23.731 --> 02:59:26.940
<v Speaker 3>on what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they say and what they believe.</v>

4065
02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

4066
