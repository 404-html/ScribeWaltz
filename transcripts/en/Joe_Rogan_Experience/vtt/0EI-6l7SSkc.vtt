00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew like foreign languages,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>so I can say something like,</v>

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know what that means.</v>

7
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>So I might be saying something stupid.</v>

8
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Hello everybody in English,</v>

10
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>which we were talking about before the podcast even began.</v>

11
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>So we're not bullshitting you when we tell you it's awesome.</v>

12
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.171
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Nick Usif used the Squarespace.</v>

14
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Brian's made at least 20 or 30 websites,</v>

16
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.113
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess.</v>

18
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

20
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

21
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>It's super easy to do.</v>

22
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a huge pain in the ass if you wanted to get a website,</v>

23
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>unless you were super lucky and knew some guy who was awesome and it was easy to</v>

24
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

25
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.541
<v Speaker 1>Like me,</v>

26
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I have found an awesome guy.</v>

27
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

28
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.923
<v Speaker 1>my friend Menthol,</v>

30
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>

31
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>if you don't find that you're fucked,</v>

32
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>you've got to try to learn coding yourself.</v>

34
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

35
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

36
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.311
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>

37
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>

38
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it used to be really difficult to mash things up.</v>

39
00:00:59.161 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Like for,</v>

40
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.171
<v Speaker 1>one browser.</v>

42
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:01.891
<v Speaker 1>It would look great,</v>

43
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>but then you'd see it in safari.</v>

44
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>It would look all wonky or you know,</v>

45
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>it worked good with a windows,</v>

46
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't work with a Mac or whatever it was.</v>

47
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>There was always issues with compatibility,</v>

48
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>like iPhone compatibility.</v>

49
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times that would be squirrelly.</v>

50
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.810

121
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that it's waterproof.</v>

122
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty slick.</v>

123
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.301
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

124
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>And they're all becoming waterproof to make so much more sense.</v>

125
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>He dropped his phone in water,</v>

127
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

128
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like what gets out of the water?</v>

131
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>What bitch water resistant.</v>

132
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are actually waterproof,</v>

133
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's a Sony that's actually waterproof,</v>

134
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty fantastic.</v>

135
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>A ting is a website or things,</v>

136
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>a mobile service company that uses a sprint.</v>

137
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 1>What they do is you buy your phone from them and then they,</v>

138
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.930
<v Speaker 1>they handle all the rest,</v>

139
00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>all goes to a sprint backbone.</v>

140
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>But you do it by their rules and their rules are just a lot fair,</v>

141
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot easier for people to digest.</v>

142
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody enjoys paying for things that are worth it.</v>

144
00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it's nice when you go to a good restaurant and he'd get a nice meal and you pay</v>

146
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:04.381
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

147
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 1>You feel good about it.</v>

148
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:06.420
<v Speaker 1>It was a good experience.</v>

149
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I cut.</v>

150
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

151
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:08.334
<v Speaker 1>You leave there,</v>

152
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever you spent was totally worth it.</v>

153
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>It's always a shitty feeling when you know,</v>

154
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>even if you enjoy something,</v>

155
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like you've got fucked over or you feel like it's too much,</v>

156
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's not fair.</v>

157
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>And for the longest time the weigh cell phone,</v>

158
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>companies have done business has irked a lot of people.</v>

160
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the things being that you pay for your minutes,</v>

161
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

162
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you have like this thing like 120 minutes,</v>

163
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't use that hundred 20 minutes,</v>

164
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't get any money back.</v>

165
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that money's just gone.</v>

166
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Like all the time is out in the ether.</v>

167
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And Ting was like,</v>

168
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>well why do you have to pay for Shit you're not using?</v>

169
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.503
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>

170
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.400
<v Speaker 1>How about we work out a really simple way to do it where most people would save</v>

171
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>money and we just do it by the minute.</v>

172
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever you use,</v>

173
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what you pay for.</v>

174
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't use that much,</v>

175
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you pay less.</v>

176
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to save money,</v>

177
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 1>use your fucking phone less.</v>

178
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.881
<v Speaker 1>And they like,</v>

179
00:04:56.881 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you could really do that and ting figured out how to do it and I think that all</v>

180
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>cell phone companies in the future,</v>

181
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going to follow that model.</v>

182
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be one of those things like remember he used to pay for</v>

183
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.384
<v Speaker 1>roaming,</v>

184
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>he'd get in your phone and you drive 20 minutes,</v>

185
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 1>are you getting your car rather?</v>

186
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And you've had,</v>

187
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you have your phone on you at 20 minutes outside of the city,</v>

188
00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:12.834
<v Speaker 1>you'd be roaming.</v>

189
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So it costs you like some ridiculous amount of money.</v>

190
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Where'd all that go?</v>

191
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.790
<v Speaker 1>All that shit went away.</v>

192
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It had to go away because companies like tin come along and they come up with a</v>

193
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:21.924
<v Speaker 1>better way to do it.</v>

194
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.243
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

195
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what I feel.</v>

196
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the minute,</v>

197
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>the whole minute thing is going to go away soon because I was just thinking,</v>

198
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 2>know how many minutes I,</v>

199
00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 2>a month I use on my cell phone talking,</v>

200
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I barely talk on my phone.</v>

201
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I can take these a minute a month.</v>

202
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I bet 10 minutes a month.</v>

203
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

204
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I Bet I I use 10 minutes a month that they charge for data now the same way they</v>

205
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>used to charge for a minutes.</v>

206
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 2>As minutes or like nothing.</v>

208
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

209
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:45.491
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

210
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:45.701
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

211
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.534
<v Speaker 2>Nothing anymore.</v>

212
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I still don't totally understand.</v>

213
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And why</v>

214
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.950
<v Speaker 1>data is expensive.</v>

215
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's confusing to me.</v>

216
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I get storing it would be expensive and I,</v>

217
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

218
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

219
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

220
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>is it electricity?</v>

221
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

222
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 3>what does being used?</v>

223
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 3>There's bandwidth,</v>

224
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

225
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 3>But what exactly is bandwidth?</v>

227
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Like this is how stupid I am stupid.</v>

228
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I am on something that I rely on on a daily basis.</v>

229
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about how the Internet works.</v>

230
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 3>You're pretty much paying to use computers to transfer data to you.</v>

232
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's using computers.</v>

233
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 3>It's way over priced and it should be definitely,</v>

234
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

235
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 3>the computer,</v>

236
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about all that because imagine if you had to reset it up yourself.</v>

237
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.361
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

238
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.194
<v Speaker 3>you know</v>

239
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.150
<v Speaker 1>they quit,</v>

240
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

241
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Everybody quit time to make a new internet.</v>

242
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>How much would it cost?</v>

244
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.233
<v Speaker 1>How Wa,</v>

245
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>how could you ever come up with four g on your own?</v>

246
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Not We,</v>

247
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we need these fuckers.</v>

248
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno how</v>

249
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Speaker 3>it would be smoke signal.</v>

250
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the next step.</v>

251
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm like there's no internet.</v>

252
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm yelling and starting fires.</v>

253
00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Yelling louder shouldn't be.</v>

254
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 3>We should be so happy.</v>

255
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.670
<v Speaker 1>People out there that are way smarter than us to figure that fucking thing out.</v>

256
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 1>We should be so happy.</v>

257
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You know we would have never figured out the Internet.</v>

258
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.730
<v Speaker 1>There's some like that that just the evidence that the Internet is real.</v>

259
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.780
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the best evidence is that there are people that are just so far</v>

260
00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:12.330
<v Speaker 1>beyond how fucking smart you think smart is.</v>

261
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like remember when you were like five or six years old you had like a lot</v>

262
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>of times you had like this one kid in the neighborhood that maybe it was like a</v>

263
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.021
<v Speaker 1>little bit bigger,</v>

264
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:25.110
<v Speaker 1>a little bit stronger than the other kids and when you would play with them on</v>

265
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:25.651
<v Speaker 1>the field,</v>

266
00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:26.970
<v Speaker 1>like you'd get like bummed out.</v>

267
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:31.971

268
00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 1>that was a strong little kid.</v>

269
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 3>But if you were there right now,</v>

270
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.311
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

284
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.730
<v Speaker 1>like technologically and,</v>

285
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.470
<v Speaker 1>and just the mental capacity of a super genius and comparison to me.</v>

286
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if a,</v>

287
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm that little kid and like if I tried to figure out how the fuck they figured</v>

288
00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:05.551
<v Speaker 1>out the Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just be like,</v>

290

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>brain isn't worked out good.</v>

292
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk to you.</v>

293
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 3>You're freaking me out,</v>

294
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:11.314
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

295
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.711
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

296
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:12.041
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

297
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 3>if you went into one of those dudes offices and they had those crazy like</v>

298
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.570
<v Speaker 3>goodwill hunting shit on the wall and he's doing those equations that fucking</v>

299
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:20.860
<v Speaker 3>nobody understands,</v>

300
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

301
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.080
<v Speaker 3>that they'll work on for years.</v>

302
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

303
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 3>even the professor didn't like,</v>

304
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 3>how did you,</v>

305
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.940
<v Speaker 3>what does fuck yeah.</v>

306
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember like in goodwill hunting,</v>

307
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:30.094
<v Speaker 3>the fucking dumb,</v>

308
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.960
<v Speaker 3>the janitor fixes the problem.</v>

309
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.960
<v Speaker 3>They leave it open to the janitor can work on the problem.</v>

310
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.213
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

311
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:36.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:37.720
<v Speaker 3>What if he just erased it?</v>

313
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 3>What if he's just crazy?</v>

314
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.001
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>

315
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Why you had channeled her bitch,</v>

316
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 3>this is a stupid story.</v>

317
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Here's a super genius janitor.</v>

318
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

319
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 3>The Fuck Outta here.</v>

320
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:48.190
<v Speaker 3>You're smarter than anybody.</v>

321
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You can figure out these equations and nobody else can and you're also</v>

322
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

323
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.163
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

324
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds and charming</v>

325
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

326
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>rogan.ting.com go get a phone.</v>

327
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.233
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>

328
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>They have all the best android phones.</v>

329
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

330
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.751
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

331
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.111
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

332
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>this one I got that's a waterproof is the galaxy s five</v>

333
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.540
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make the drought worse.</v>

334
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.580
<v Speaker 2>The galaxy s five [inaudible] in the shower for like two hours.</v>

335
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think about that.</v>

336
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Not worrying about like the pool and shit.</v>

337
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:20.241 --> 00:09:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember when they were dipping phones,</v>

340
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.230
<v Speaker 1>there was like a company that would dip them,</v>

341
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.710
<v Speaker 1>like dip your iPhone and then they would send it back to you and essentially be</v>

342
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:28.544
<v Speaker 1>waterproof.</v>

343
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they,</v>

344
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.940
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what they did with Das.</v>

345
00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:32.650
<v Speaker 2>They probably just dipped him maybe,</v>

346
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 2>but did that work?</v>

347
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.881
<v Speaker 2>Probably work.</v>

348
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:34.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

349
00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:34.780
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

350
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.613
<v Speaker 2>Did that work?</v>

351
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.010
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

352
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know what that worked?</v>

353
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I think for water resistance,</v>

354
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.850
<v Speaker 2>the it has to work.</v>

355
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not just dipping it.</v>

356
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:41.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

357
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you could drop your phone in a toilet like all of us have and it's still work,</v>

358
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.001
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

359
00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So the dipping it,</v>

360
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean even if it's 99% accurate,</v>

361
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:50.140
<v Speaker 2>it's still probably going to,</v>

362
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.983
<v Speaker 2>work enough.</v>

364
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

366
00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I bet the fine print is like 20 pages long,</v>

367
00:09:55.871 --> 00:09:56.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

368
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.900
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be under four minutes and all these other guys.</v>

369
00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:02.900
<v Speaker 1>It's probably got to be like under 30 meters or something like that.</v>

372
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Probably have like a,</v>

373
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.740
<v Speaker 1>like what's like a good waterproof depth for a watch because they have squirrely</v>

374
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.650
<v Speaker 1>little rules.</v>

375
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.410
<v Speaker 1>So they'll say water resistant up to 30 million.</v>

376
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

377
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:13.580
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

378
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.780
<v Speaker 1>waterproof or not.</v>

379
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like water pressure.</v>

380
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:17.834
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

381
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.993
<v Speaker 1>That shit's legit.</v>

382
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

383
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.621
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

384
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:21.951
<v Speaker 1>it hurts.</v>

385
00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Your ears probably would fuck with your phone too.</v>

386
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.683
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

387
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

388
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.840
<v Speaker 1>rogan.ting.com go there and save 25 bucks off a new tank phone.</v>

389
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.700
<v Speaker 1>He'd dirty savages.</v>

390
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And last but not least,</v>

391
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.180
<v Speaker 1>we're brought to you by on at.com.</v>

392
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:35.601
<v Speaker 1>It's O,</v>

393
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.260
<v Speaker 1>n n,</v>

394
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I t ana is what you would call it,</v>

395
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.310
<v Speaker 1>a human optimization website.</v>

396
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>We sell strength and conditioning equipment.</v>

397
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:48.500
<v Speaker 1>We sell delicious snacks and foods like the warrior bar,</v>

398
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>

399
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.630
<v Speaker 1>somebody actually brought this up.</v>

400
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a,</v>

401
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 1>an important point.</v>

402
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Somebody brought this up to me on Twitter.</v>

403
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no added nitrates in,</v>

404
00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:58.754
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

405
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>in these buffalo bars,</v>

406
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:05.111
<v Speaker 1>but there's naturally occurring nitrates that occur in sea salt and celery.</v>

407
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.761
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

408
00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:07.941
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.560
<v Speaker 1>that's something to consider.</v>

410
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>And also like,</v>

411
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not,</v>

412
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:14.540
<v Speaker 1>like I was saying on this,</v>

413
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:15.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

414
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.180
<v Speaker 1>this ad before when I would read it before,</v>

415
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the points is that it has no nitrates.</v>

416
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know exactly if nitrates are actually bad for you in natural form.</v>

417
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're bad for you and sea salt form or bathroom salary or if</v>

418
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:27.861
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

419
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:28.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

420
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.331
<v Speaker 1>an amount thing.</v>

421
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good question for a doctor,</v>

422
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda,</v>

423
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:33.134
<v Speaker 1>Patrick,</v>

424
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.741
<v Speaker 1>and she's,</v>

425
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

426
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.880
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be coming back.</v>

427
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>We're exchanging email,</v>

428
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.930
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully I can get an answer for from her on this kind of stuff.</v>

429
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to health and anything,</v>

430
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:45.790
<v Speaker 1>like anything that's controversial diets and you know,</v>

431
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and supplementation and things along those lines,</v>

432
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't stress enough.</v>

433
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>If you've got any questions about that kind of shit,</v>

434
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to Google it and you to read both sides.</v>

435
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not comfortable to do.</v>

436
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>

437
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.981
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He got to read.</v>

445

450
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of guessing.</v>

451
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Or if you know someone like Rhonda Patrick,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Vitamin D excellent.</v>

466
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that most people are deficient in apparently according to</v>

467
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 1>numerous studies.</v>

468
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 1>They say that most people,</v>

469
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>like 70% of the population does not get enough vitamin D.</v>

470
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>When I just had,</v>

471
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.891

472
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that was wrong with me.</v>

473
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody do it.</v>

474
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It's super common.</v>

475
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting enough sun.</v>

476
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>People were supposed to be on the sun all the time,</v>

477
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>we're scared.</v>

479
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's scared of camp.</v>

480
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get the kid outside dairy too.</v>

481
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

482
00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You get it a lot from dairy.</v>

483
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't dare give you cancer.</v>

484
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

485
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.551

<v Speaker 1>You get it from milk,</v>

489
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>so I'm probably very deficient and the cows are you really?</v>

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to trick them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which is a lot.</v>

548
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.720
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

549
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good and it's really guilt free.</v>

550
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

551
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>as far as like nitrates,</v>

552
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it's salary and salt.</v>

553
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a v.</v>

554
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.750
<v Speaker 1>All very good question and I'm going to have to look into that.</v>

555
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I had substance use it.</v>

556
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't be a pussy.</v>

557
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about salary and salt.</v>

558
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] worried about salary,</v>

559
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking sea salt and salary.</v>

560
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>If those are the two things that are going to take you out in this game,</v>

561
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.870
<v Speaker 1>how weak is your defense son?</v>

562
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.310
<v Speaker 1>How weak?</v>

563
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

564
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.150
<v Speaker 1>we sell a lot of shit on it that we find,</v>

565
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:55.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

566
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you can find other places.</v>

567
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

568
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but what we tried to do is just get the,</v>

569
00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>the best versions of it available,</v>

570
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:01.971
<v Speaker 1>like hemp force,</v>

571
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 1>protein powders.</v>

572
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

573
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 1>an important one when it comes to that.</v>

574
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You can get hemp protein from other places,</v>

575
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times it's super gritty.</v>

576
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

577
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to digest,</v>

578
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>to assist a different texture.</v>

579
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>It feels different when you drink it.</v>

580
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

581
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>it's just because it's not the highest quality of the stuff that we buy.</v>

582
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.541
<v Speaker 1>Cost more money,</v>

583
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's higher in protein and it's,</v>

584
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.130
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to digest.</v>

585
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's super powdery.</v>

586
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting the difference between the hemp force protein powder</v>

587
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

588
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I've used some powders from some other companies that use the cheaper shits,</v>

590
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>like just more cores,</v>

591
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>more fiber in it.</v>

592
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.931
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

593
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:36.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've tasted in your mouth and you're drinking grit.</v>

595
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.571
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

596
00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like the,</v>

597
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 1>your body's ability to digest it,</v>

598
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the easiest form of protein to digest.</v>

599
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 1>My body has zero problems.</v>

600
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

601
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I can drink a hemp force protein shake with coconut water and work out in like</v>

602
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 1>an hour.</v>

603
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.701
<v Speaker 1>That's never,</v>

604
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:56.534
<v Speaker 1>I can't do,</v>

605
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing else I can eat or I can work out in an hour and it can be</v>

606
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 1>comfortable about it because the stuff just digest so easily.</v>

607
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I love way.</v>

608
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd love like those,</v>

609
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:06.674
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

610
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>muscle milk's,</v>

611
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 1>those are fucking delicious.</v>

612
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.583
<v Speaker 1>Those tastes good.</v>

613
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 1>But my body does not react that well to that stuff.</v>

614
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

615
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 4>what was the difference you notice between muscle milk and the hemp then?</v>

617
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.660
<v Speaker 4>No farts.</v>

618
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

619
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.040
<v Speaker 4>let's be real big.</v>

620
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Will make you sick.</v>

621
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.690
<v Speaker 4>Let's get crazy.</v>

622
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 4>I would fart like crazy when I would drink the way pre,</v>

623
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 4>remember Tate's farts.</v>

624
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 4>There's still legendary.</v>

625
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.840
<v Speaker 4>It's all weight.</v>

626
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.673
<v Speaker 4>They smell.</v>

627
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.390
<v Speaker 4>It's all whey protein men.</v>

628
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:30.840

629
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.471

<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

631
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.231
<v Speaker 1>Whey protein.</v>

632
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's bad,</v>

633
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but as far as digestibility,</v>

634
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

635
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.740

<v Speaker 1>Whether I was selling or not,</v>

637
00:16:40.091 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you that it's fucking fantastic.</v>

638
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.240

<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different world than the rest of America.</v>

680
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

681

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.260
<v Speaker 1>South Florida's wild and all the bad ways.</v>

683
00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Like Florida,</v>

684

<v Speaker 1>You follow that Florida man Twitter account?</v>

686
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's just no denying.</v>

688
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:45.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would,</v>

689
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I would like to have someone like Sam Harris,</v>

690
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 4>some like really rational guy break down</v>

691
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>why Florida actually has no more crime.</v>

692
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just that for whatever reason people focus on Florida.</v>

693
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if that's entirely accurate.</v>

694
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.140
<v Speaker 1>The sheer numbers of idiocy that you get this just a numbers,</v>

695
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 1>a moron to come out of Florida.</v>

696
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's almost hard to believe,</v>

697
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:07.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

698
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Watched almost every single episode of Cops and Florida is always the best</v>

699
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.223
<v Speaker 2>episodes.</v>

700
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.831
<v Speaker 2>That's a great show.</v>

701
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

702
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.040
<v Speaker 2>They should do it as long as they,</v>

703
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

704
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.510
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

705
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>they re edited all the old episodes of cops and like made an HD and edit them</v>

706
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 2>real fast and quick now.</v>

707
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's called cops reloaded.</v>

708
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

709
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.543
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

710
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much they could do just on Florida.</v>

711
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

712

<v Speaker 2>because it picked out from every other,</v>

713
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>if you could just have camera's running 24 hours a day and hire some editors,</v>

714
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>just keep the cameras on.</v>

715
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You would never go wrong.</v>

716
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean Wacky Shit happens in Florida all like if you were a vice cop in Miami</v>

717
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.070

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.310
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>

730
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:02.731
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

731
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be every other day there'd be something amazing,</v>

732
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.593
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

733
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone should just have a GoPro on their head and just be traveling.</v>

734
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.930
<v Speaker 2>And I do</v>

735
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.201
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

736
00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:17.000
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of states they said that's lowered the instances of police harassment</v>

737
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 1>or police brutality substantially.</v>

738
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>

739
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe Los Angeles has some,</v>

740
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.510
<v Speaker 1>some sort of program,</v>

741
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 1>at least on some of the officers where they put these cameras on them.</v>

742
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

743
00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to see so much video of cops beating people up,</v>

744
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:31.101
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

745
00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really disturbed.</v>

746
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.110
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

747
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It's so disturbing.</v>

748
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Like that one cop that beat that lady up on the side of the freeway,</v>

749
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 1>it was seen that one.</v>

750
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.821
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

751
00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

752
00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:45.980
<v Speaker 1>She might've been mentally challenged and she was acting like she was walking in</v>

753
00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:46.820
<v Speaker 1>the on the freeway.</v>

754
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what her deal was.</v>

755
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.031
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

756
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:52.820
<v Speaker 1>But if that is the only way that he can control her,</v>

757
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:54.080
<v Speaker 1>she shouldn't be a cop.</v>

758
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just fucking waylay somebody in the face over and over again</v>

759
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:01.160
<v Speaker 1>while you're holding on to their neck on the side of the highway.</v>

760
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.030
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do that.</v>

761
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.133
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

762
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not defensive.</v>

763
00:20:04.791 --> 00:20:05.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not like,</v>

764
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not saving them from themselves.</v>

765
00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You're not saving anybody from the,</v>

766
00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you're assaulting them.</v>

767
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

768
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.870
<v Speaker 1>like you should be able to contain that woman.</v>

769
00:20:11.871 --> 00:20:13.640
<v Speaker 1>A woman wasn't as striking him at all.</v>

770
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.590
<v Speaker 1>If you had any,</v>

771
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:17.810
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of Jujitsu whatsoever,</v>

773
00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you would just contain her.</v>

774
00:20:18.831 --> 00:20:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It'd be really easy to do.</v>

775
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

776
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you might get hit with some clawing at you and shit,</v>

777
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 1>but you could hold her in place and nobody has to get hurt if you're a cop.</v>

778
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that woman was attacking him.</v>

779
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

780
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:32.180
<v Speaker 1>if that one was attacking him,</v>

781
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 1>like say if that woman had a bat or a knife or something and she's coming at him</v>

782
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.830
<v Speaker 1>and he took her down and punch her in the face,</v>

783
00:20:36.831 --> 00:20:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for that.</v>

784
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a Dane.</v>

785
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>That might as well be an animal.</v>

786
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:41.750
<v Speaker 1>A person that's attacking you with a weapon.</v>

787
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be an animal.</v>

788
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.620
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel like if would you kick a dog that tried to bite you?</v>

789
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

790
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.910
<v Speaker 1>A with a knife that's coming at you.</v>

791
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman.</v>

792
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They're getting punched in their fucking face for real.</v>

793
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

794
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It Ha you have to.</v>

795
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're a dead man Brian.</v>

796
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

797
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Is running an option cause I'd like to just run away.</v>

798
00:20:59.820 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

799
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 2>you could run faster.</v>

800
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:01.991
<v Speaker 2>Definitely do.</v>

801
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:02.201
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

802
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:02.411
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

803
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:03.244
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

804
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Side to side.</v>

805
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.620
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a good Juke,</v>

806
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

807
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a cop,</v>

808
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't just beat somebody up like that.</v>

809
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do that.</v>

810
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:13.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

811
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:16.000
<v Speaker 1>that lady's not hitting you like you,</v>

812
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.481
<v Speaker 1>like she's,</v>

813
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:18.550
<v Speaker 1>which wouldn't listen like what's going on?</v>

814
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way she could've been doing anything that's that justified</v>

815
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 1>getting a fuck beat out of her life.</v>

816
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there like some police force that's now putting Gopros on all the cops?</v>

817
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

818
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.200
<v Speaker 2>their whole forest.</v>

819
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.140
<v Speaker 2>You have to have like a GoPro camera on your person now.</v>

820
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.003
<v Speaker 2>We should probably Google.</v>

821
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.953
<v Speaker 2>He keeps saying,</v>

822
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.721
<v Speaker 2>I just heard it.</v>

823
00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:36.831
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

824
00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:37.470
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great.</v>

825
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

826
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.180
<v Speaker 2>that makes so much more sense.</v>

827
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

828
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.300
<v Speaker 2>And would,</v>

829
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.260
<v Speaker 2>would it would,</v>

830
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.400
<v Speaker 2>it should be something that broadcasts.</v>

831
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

832
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>that'd be cool.</v>

833
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

834
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 2>because subscribed to that would be the best cops by the way.</v>

835
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Ever,</v>

836
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.233
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

837
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.361
<v Speaker 2>You go home.</v>

838
00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what's going on in my hometown cops.</v>

839
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:57.530
<v Speaker 2>You could just stream it Compton really low.</v>

840
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.411
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad.</v>

841
00:21:58.411 --> 00:22:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Cops use go pros to film traffic.</v>

842
00:22:00.481 --> 00:22:00.900
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

843
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

844
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:01.944
<v Speaker 2>this is different.</v>

845
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Florida actually,</v>

846
00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:06.450
<v Speaker 2>that now that I think about it.</v>

847
00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:07.284
<v Speaker 2>That was doing it.</v>

848
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Florida police camera.</v>

849
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

850
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

851
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.630
<v Speaker 1>copies is a Gopro to film a traffic stop of a lieutenant cop.</v>

852
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.081
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

853
00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Miami police officer,</v>

854
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he made a routine traffic stop.</v>

855
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.310
<v Speaker 1>He discovered that it's a man of superior rank,</v>

856
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.740
<v Speaker 1>like a cop that superior ranked him.</v>

857
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.040
<v Speaker 1>They start fighting and he got suspended.</v>

858
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

859
00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

860
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.430
<v Speaker 1>And the lieutenant is merely reassigned,</v>

861
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

862
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

863
00:22:33.001 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>he filmed the whole thing too.</v>

864
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

865
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>

866
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.190
<v Speaker 1>like that's like a weird thing to rank thing for police officers.</v>

867
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Like that's some military shit.</v>

868
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole rank thing like that.</v>

869
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.500
<v Speaker 1>He had to like,</v>

870
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.620
<v Speaker 1>give in to a superior officer.</v>

872
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what the issue is.</v>

873
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.720
<v Speaker 1>A superior rank.</v>

874
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

875
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a guide</v>

876
00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Speaker 2>general or the person ran a red light,</v>

877
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.760
<v Speaker 2>like let's calm down.</v>

878
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:02.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

879
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

880
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 1>cops should be able to get better positions as they get better at their job and</v>

881
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:12.121
<v Speaker 1>they should get more prestige as they get more experience and knowledge officer</v>

882
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>went out to California now required to wear video cameras while on,</v>

883
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.850
<v Speaker 2>see it's right in the middle and it says,</v>

884
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:20.370
<v Speaker 2>just like full on Gopro that just records every time.</v>

885
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.340
<v Speaker 2>One year use</v>

886
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.101
<v Speaker 1>of force of drops,</v>

887
00:23:22.101 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>60% complaints have dropped 88%.</v>

888
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

889
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

890
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

891
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

892
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>That's accountability,</v>

893
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:31.081
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

894
00:23:31.081 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

895
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it's all about accountability.</v>

896
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:34.150
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what that is.</v>

897
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.043
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

898
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not that,</v>

899
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 1>that's being a cop is a tricky decision to be the guy who decides how things get</v>

900
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 1>handled and times of stress.</v>

901
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's your job.</v>

902
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You do that every day.</v>

903
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.181
<v Speaker 1>You come in,</v>

904
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 1>people are screaming,</v>

905
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>wives and husbands,</v>

906
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>are you worried you're going to get shot?</v>

907
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Like they're always worried they're going to get shot.</v>

908
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Like domestic violence cases especially,</v>

909
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.621
<v Speaker 1>he imagined,</v>

910
00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I have anything to do with these crazy people,</v>

911
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but the neighbors' lights are all on,</v>

912
00:23:58.881 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it's five o'clock in the morning,</v>

913
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 1>people are screaming,</v>

914
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 1>they're throwing shit and you know,</v>

915
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:03.131
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

916
00:24:03.131 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 1>you hear the guy say I'm gonna fucking kill you and you're outside and you're a</v>

917
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 1>cop and you're like,</v>

918
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ here.</v>

919
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>We got like that's your job.</v>

920
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

921
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy job.</v>

922
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for anybody,</v>

923
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I think to expect that people that go through that job on a daily basis or</v>

924
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 1>perfect or they should be held to the same standards as everybody else as far as</v>

925
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:26.790
<v Speaker 1>like their ability to tolerate bullshit cause they get,</v>

926
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>they see too much.</v>

927
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

928
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy job.</v>

929
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.971
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy job.</v>

930
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you know when people look at pro police brutality,</v>

931
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at the cops too.</v>

932
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what are these guys being subjected to?</v>

933
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that these cops are lashing out and attacking people.</v>

934
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's making them ramp up their,</v>

935
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 1>their violence.</v>

936
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So they just inherently violent.</v>

937
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a real convenient way to look at it,</v>

938
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 1>to just decide they're just inherently violent and that they're assholes and</v>

939
00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 1>bullies and that's why they became cops in the first place.</v>

940
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 1>And that might be correct for some,</v>

941
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but you also got to take into consideration what they're seeing on a daily</v>

942
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

943
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking job is to deal with the worst situations that people have to see</v>

944
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.990
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>

945
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

946
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.553
<v Speaker 1>Bullets,</v>

947
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.700
<v Speaker 1>car accidents,</v>

948
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle wreck,</v>

949
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

950
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.670
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>

951
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.460
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

952
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:17.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

953
00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:18.990
<v Speaker 3>the worst parts of humanity.</v>

954
00:25:18.991 --> 00:25:20.430
<v Speaker 3>All the worst liars,</v>

955
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:21.061
<v Speaker 3>liars,</v>

956
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:21.781
<v Speaker 3>thieves,</v>

957
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:22.680
<v Speaker 3>rapists,</v>

958
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.873
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>

959
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.860
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be overwhelming.</v>

960
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.960
<v Speaker 3>And then for them to be,</v>

961
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

962
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.530
<v Speaker 3>in a situation with a person and the person is like,</v>

963
00:25:31.531 --> 00:25:32.670
<v Speaker 3>y'all don't have to listen to you.</v>

964
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.361
<v Speaker 3>Oh you don't,</v>

965
00:25:33.361 --> 00:25:34.194
<v Speaker 3>you fucking pitch.</v>

966
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.660
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

967
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.370
<v Speaker 3>they're so wound up,</v>

968
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.260
<v Speaker 3>they're always at like eight.</v>

969
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.131
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

970
00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:46.131
<v Speaker 3>if you live in that world and you're constantly like dodging this and evading</v>

971
00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:51.321
<v Speaker 3>that and capturing this guy and pulling that guy off the street and fuck man,</v>

972
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.171
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

973
00:25:52.171 --> 00:25:55.740
<v Speaker 3>it's why it surprises me when when you see cops that are so young,</v>

974
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.930
<v Speaker 3>when there's like a 21 year old,</v>

975
00:25:57.931 --> 00:25:59.610
<v Speaker 3>22 year old cop and you're like,</v>

976
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.520
<v Speaker 3>that guy is going to be able to handle all this stress.</v>

977
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Like the domestic violence thing.</v>

978
00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Like he'd show up to a house,</v>

979
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 3>husband and wife are arguing and it's like that kids probably had sex twice and</v>

980
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.290
<v Speaker 3>he's supposed to like know what to do during a,</v>

981
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

982
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they have people that they specifically assigned to those kinds of</v>

983
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>cases that are like good at that shit.</v>

984
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:21.411
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

985
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.851
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

987
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>But I would,</v>

988
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.130
<v Speaker 1>that's like an Al Pachino role and heat.</v>

989
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

990
00:26:26.891 --> 00:26:27.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

991
00:26:27.101 --> 00:26:27.934
<v Speaker 3>can I talk to you?</v>

992
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

993
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.050
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

994
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.390
<v Speaker 3>get the guy to the window and put the gun down.</v>

995
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Norman.</v>

996
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.990
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a lot of cops here.</v>

997
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

998
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.460
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like the guy who likes slowly talk to you off the ledge.</v>

999
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I bet in real life cop world though,</v>

1000
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like what is it is a murder.</v>

1001
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 3>There's no specialists.</v>

1002
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.061
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1003

1005
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing robbery.</v>

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:48.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm over here.</v>

1007
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing violent crime.</v>

1008
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Not Nothing petty.</v>

1010
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I know they're cops.</v>

1011
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:53.244
<v Speaker 1>They show up where this,</v>

1012
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:53.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1013
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 1>there's like vice departments,</v>

1014
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:55.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1015
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And they have like different departments,</v>

1016
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part they all deal with bullshit.</v>

1017
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:02.661
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

1018
00:27:02.661 --> 00:27:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Hold closer to the crime,</v>

1019
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.470
<v Speaker 2>just get there and deal with it.</v>

1020
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.630

1021
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.100
<v Speaker 2>deal with the worst of us.</v>

1022
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.570
<v Speaker 2>And every time they talk to people that people are lying.</v>

1023
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Like most of the time,</v>

1024
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.710
<v Speaker 2>most of the time people were talking to cops.</v>

1025
00:27:17.711 --> 00:27:18.544
<v Speaker 2>They're lying.</v>

1026
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:18.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:27:18.911 --> 00:27:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever talked to a cop when it hasn't been like I'm on the end</v>

1028
00:27:23.261 --> 00:27:24.580
<v Speaker 2>of getting in trouble and I'm like,</v>

1029
00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:25.414
<v Speaker 2>how do I get out of it?</v>

1030
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I've never just been like,</v>

1031
00:27:27.791 --> 00:27:28.420

1035
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

1036

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1037

<v Speaker 1>And it's all he was doing and she was saying that she was going to say that he</v>

1052
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 1>sexually assaulted her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>packing it up.</v>

1101
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And then she's done it before obviously.</v>

00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause then that guy came up to her.</v>

1103
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.460
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't surprised,</v>

1110
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1111
00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:23.661
<v Speaker 1>it had been,</v>

1112
00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:24.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a complicated tent.</v>

1113
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:27.850
<v Speaker 1>They got like fucking posts and Shit and they're folded everything up and put it</v>

1114
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:30.670
<v Speaker 1>in bags and stuff and it's all dirty broads.</v>

1115
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Just stealing shit</v>

1116
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 2>probably has gotten away with that for the last 15 years.</v>

1117
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>After you hit a certain age,</v>

1119
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:40.170
<v Speaker 2>no one suspects you right.</v>

1120
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 2>That's an innocent old person's not going</v>

1121
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>to steal anything.</v>

1122
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1123
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 1>people become dose and they don't even know why.</v>

1124
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a girl that I was dating when when I was in high school that had a</v>

1125
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 1>bit of an issue at one point in time.</v>

1126
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 1>And she was a very good person.</v>

1127
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.280
<v Speaker 1>She went a bad person at all.</v>

1128
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 1>She's not like a bad kid from a bad home,</v>

1129
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but she wanted something and she didn't have the money and she just took it,</v>

1130
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1131
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was just this thing where like she did it a couple of times and she got</v>

1132
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.631
<v Speaker 1>in trouble for it.</v>

1133
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get arrested but she got caught.</v>

1134
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>She would give the stuff back.</v>

1135
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1136
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1137
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.830
<v Speaker 1>wasn't anything monumental,</v>

1138
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough where she was trying to understand why she was doing this.</v>

1139
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't,</v>

1140
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I almost can't stop.</v>

1141
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I go in the store and there's something I want and I know no one's looking.</v>

1142
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to get it and I'm like that.</v>

1143
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.463
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1144
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that stealing.</v>

1145
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>But she is,</v>

1146
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.360
<v Speaker 1>it was like when they say Kleptomania like for some folks it really is an issue.</v>

1147
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Like they really can get obsessed with this idea of stealing something and they</v>

1148
00:30:45.131 --> 00:30:45.641
<v Speaker 1>can't help.</v>

1149
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:45.830
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

1150
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:46.370
<v Speaker 2>shall ideas.</v>

1151
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.310
<v Speaker 2>He has to do it all the allegedly all the time at the,</v>

1152
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I like the airport would just be like,</v>

1153
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.730
<v Speaker 2>he would just be stuffing hamburgers in his pockets and you're just like,</v>

1154
00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you worried about this Brian?</v>

1155
00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Or he'll just go and get to one of those little stands where they have like</v>

1156
00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:05.540
<v Speaker 2>drinks and popcorn and stuff and he's just putting stuff in his pockets like</v>

1157
00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:06.351
<v Speaker 2>right in the open,</v>

1158
00:31:06.351 --> 00:31:09.530
<v Speaker 2>like not because it's about the thrill.</v>

1159
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not even like,</v>

1160
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.360
<v Speaker 2>oh I need this thing.</v>

1161
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it like the adrenaline?</v>

1162
00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Can I get away with it?</v>

1163
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's</v>

1164
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:14.581
<v Speaker 1>say this about Joey,</v>

1165
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago and he's a different guy.</v>

1166
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>No role at all anymore,</v>

1167
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1168
00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:19.671
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1169
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:19.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1170
00:31:19.881 --> 00:31:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the girl was 17 at the time.</v>

1171
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1172
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.053
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>

1173
00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.400
<v Speaker 1>she's not a bad person by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1174
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.330
<v Speaker 1>She's very nice.</v>

1175
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.040
<v Speaker 1>She's very smart too.</v>

1176
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.400
<v Speaker 1>She just had a thing and that thing was she wanted to steal shit.</v>

1177
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think,</v>

1178
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1179
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it could be a combination.</v>

1180
00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.253
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1181
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.220
<v Speaker 1>when you're 17,</v>

1182
00:31:37.221 --> 00:31:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially insane,</v>

1183
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1184
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1185
00:31:40.041 --> 00:31:43.280
<v Speaker 1>you really are not sure what's going on for the last couple of years.</v>

1186
00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Your body's been overwhelmed with hormones and you're like,</v>

1187
00:31:46.701 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1188
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:47.991
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1189
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:50.660
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel so different than I did,</v>

1190
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:51.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:31:51.051 --> 00:31:52.340
<v Speaker 1>just two or three years ago.</v>

1192
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And you're obsessed with girls,</v>

1193
00:31:54.711 --> 00:31:55.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1194
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And girls are obsessed with boys and so you've just start fooling around having</v>

1195
00:31:59.841 --> 00:32:04.841
<v Speaker 1>sex and it becomes like your whole life becomes obsessive when you're young and</v>

1196
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.670
<v Speaker 1>you're about to become an adult and you're going to have to take care of</v>

1197
00:32:07.671 --> 00:32:07.970
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1198
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:08.301
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1199
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:08.900
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1200
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Nobody taught me shit.</v>

1201
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I just want to fuck all the dumb 17 I'm almost 18 then I got to fend for myself,</v>

1202
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:17.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and then graduations out and you take your deep breath and you try to figure it</v>

1204
00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:21.831
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1205
00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:22.461
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>

1206
00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:23.294
<v Speaker 1>what next?</v>

1207
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.440
<v Speaker 1>They're all crazy.</v>

1208
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Everyone that age is crazy.</v>

1209
00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:30.590
<v Speaker 1>So some of them steal clothes and some of them sniff paint and some of them,</v>

1210
00:32:30.591 --> 00:32:31.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1211
00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:33.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever become cops that beat people.</v>

1212
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a little harder than you can't be more than 17 how old do you have to be</v>

1213
00:32:37.311 --> 00:32:38.144
<v Speaker 1>to be a cop?</v>

1214
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1215
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1216
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1217
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.890
<v Speaker 3>ACP 14 if you can join the military,</v>

1218
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1219
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 3>she'll be 40 she'll be 40 year old dudes are yoked.</v>

1220
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.170
<v Speaker 3>They're like hiring and Burbank cops right now.</v>

1221
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 3>There's signs everywhere that says now hiring.</v>

1222
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's probably a tough job.</v>

1223
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It's probably tough to get people to do because uh,</v>

1224
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1225
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think most of us have the perspective to understand what they have to go</v>

1226
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1227
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of people also treat cops would like to stains kind of cool to</v>

1228
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:05.750
<v Speaker 3>treat cops with disdain,</v>

1229
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 3>but that's all well and good.</v>

1230
00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 3>But if the shit hit the fan,</v>

1231
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you'd be fucking happy they were cops.</v>

1232
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1233
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1234
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:11.901

1235
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.980

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.251
<v Speaker 3>That are willing.</v>

1302
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it was a hundred of those guys.</v>

1303
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1304
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.921
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1305
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Out in the street.</v>

1306
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.503
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1307
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what you've got to really worry about.</v>

1308
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 3>We got really worried about is people that don't think you need a military or</v>

1309
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 3>don't think you need law enforcement.</v>

1310
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>You're really kind of underestimating the evil that human beings are capable of.</v>

1311
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 3>We've just been in a nice place here in America for a few hundred years.</v>

1312
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:27.681
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sweet.</v>

1313
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 3>As far as world history goes,</v>

1314
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 3>like it's invading violence.</v>

1315
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.911
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sweet.</v>

1316
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the best spots ever.</v>

1317
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Like a solid 200 plus years have nobody coming</v>

1318
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 1>over here and fucking us up like a few little baby attacks,</v>

1319
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 1>but nothing in comparison to anything that any other empire had to go through</v>

1320
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.210
<v Speaker 1>over like you know the course of its,</v>

1321
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it's rain now.</v>

1322
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how many like human beings,</v>

1323
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 1>how many different countries they are in this country and then that we have</v>

1324
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 1>military bases and like a hundred plus of those countries.</v>

1325
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.500
<v Speaker 1>You know those numbers are crazy.</v>

1326
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just stopping and thinking about how many of us there are is nuts,</v>

1327
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but if there wasn't a military and so crazy fucks like those north Hollywood</v>

1328
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 1>guys gathered up together and decided to start taking shit over,</v>

1329
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

1330
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 1>People are capable of that.</v>

1331
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1332
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unfortunate,</v>

1333
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's a realistic aspect I could to realistic subject.</v>

1334
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be breached.</v>

1335
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very unfortunate that people are capable of things like that,</v>

1336
00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:32.121
<v Speaker 1>but they are and to not plan on it and to not be prepared in case it happens.</v>

1337
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of civilizations that don't exist anymore because of that.</v>

1338
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:36:37.281 --> 00:36:37.610
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1340
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you get used to the safety you have.</v>

1341
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to like you know,</v>

1342
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Speaker 2>a third world country and you're like,</v>

1343
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1344
00:36:42.831 --> 00:36:44.390
<v Speaker 2>things aren't as together over there.</v>

1345
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.140
<v Speaker 2>And there's like groups of people who are fighting other groups within like that</v>

1346
00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:52.250
<v Speaker 2>could never happen here unless they got on the phone going at each other</v>

1347
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.500
<v Speaker 1>unless they got over here.</v>

1348
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.270
<v Speaker 1>See anything can happen here.</v>

1349
00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Once it happens here,</v>

1350
00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.211
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1352
00:36:57.211 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1353
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.680
<v Speaker 1>how quickly would they be able to tighten it down?</v>

1354
00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.221
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1355
00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I would hope quickly,</v>

1356
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I would hope quickly.</v>

1357
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:03.310
<v Speaker 1>But like when,</v>

1358
00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.620
<v Speaker 1>when people look at things like</v>

1359
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.781
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1360
00:37:07.781 --> 00:37:11.410
<v Speaker 1>when you look at things like the bad aspects of,</v>

1361
00:37:11.411 --> 00:37:12.244
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1362
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:17.380
<v Speaker 1>of the military or the bad aspects of war and the bad aspects of police</v>

1363
00:37:17.381 --> 00:37:18.011
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>

1364
00:37:18.011 --> 00:37:18.850
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement,</v>

1365
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.080
<v Speaker 1>the bad aspects of,</v>

1366
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:20.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:25.381
<v Speaker 1>people being horrible and police brutality in those situations.</v>

1368
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

1369
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:32.530
<v Speaker 1>people are tending to go in only one direction with the idea.</v>

1370
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Like they're only looking at the violence that these cops are doing to</v>

1371
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:36.670
<v Speaker 1>civilians.</v>

1372
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.900
<v Speaker 1>The not looking at like,</v>

1373
00:37:37.901 --> 00:37:39.940
<v Speaker 1>what are we asking these people to do?</v>

1374
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.800
<v Speaker 1>What are we asking these normal people to do for $40,000 a year and how much of</v>

1375
00:37:44.801 --> 00:37:48.970
<v Speaker 1>an assurance do we have that these people are of sound character or they can get</v>

1376
00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:49.930
<v Speaker 1>through that Gig.</v>

1377
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1378
00:37:50.411 --> 00:37:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some screening processes,</v>

1379
00:37:52.151 --> 00:37:56.830
<v Speaker 1>but how thorough is it really and how much do we really know about the impact of</v>

1380
00:37:56.831 --> 00:37:58.000
<v Speaker 1>day to day violence,</v>

1381
00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:00.460
<v Speaker 1>day to day bullshit that these people have to deal with?</v>

1382
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like the craziest job ever.</v>

1383
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you had to be a vice cop.</v>

1384
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1385
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.640
<v Speaker 2>but I would think that I would want that go pro on me.</v>

1386
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I had all the time,</v>

1387
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:08.900
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

1388
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1389
00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:10.034
<v Speaker 2>I think that would,</v>

1390
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the most important thing for cops nowadays.</v>

1391
00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I think they need that,</v>

1392
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1393
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be a perfect way to police the police and have helped the</v>

1394
00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:20.660
<v Speaker 2>cops at the same time.</v>

1395
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Imagine starting in a bad neighborhood to,</v>

1396
00:38:23.031 --> 00:38:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to start in the suburbs.</v>

1397
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to watts.</v>

1398
00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:27.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1399
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:31.070
<v Speaker 2>just let me do a couple of traffic stops before I'm like involved in a shootout.</v>

1400
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1401
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.120
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy that I used to do taekwondo with.</v>

1402
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>He got</v>

1403
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Speaker 1>reassigned.</v>

1404
00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to get reassigned to a more urban area and I go,</v>

1405
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to do that?</v>

1406
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's more action.</v>

1407
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:43.931
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1408
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 1>more action.</v>

1409
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1410
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1411
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I would want to start off like small town like where there's two cops for the</v>

1412
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>whole city,</v>

1413
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1414
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:51.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:51.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1416
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.090
<v Speaker 1>this dude,</v>

1417
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 1>this dude wanted to be with the shit was going down.</v>

1418
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>He genuinely enjoyed it.</v>

1419
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:57.371
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1420
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:57.721
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

1421
00:38:57.721 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1422
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 1>he's an odd duck.</v>

1423
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.520
<v Speaker 1>He was like a,</v>

1424
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.020
<v Speaker 1>it's weird sorta hard ass cop guy who uh,</v>

1425
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.410
<v Speaker 1>who liked to fight,</v>

1426
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 1>but he was really nice guy.</v>

1427
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:10.271
<v Speaker 1>Like as a cop.</v>

1428
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:11.104
<v Speaker 1>He's really nice.</v>

1429
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Did they have like a good sense for justice?</v>

1430
00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't like a power guy.</v>

1431
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1432
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.963
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

1433
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>He was a sweet guy,</v>

1434
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed like he would like look forward to someone doing something that he</v>

1435
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 1>could correct him on.</v>

1436
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1437
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you didn't,</v>

1438
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:25.930
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't do anything wrong,</v>

1439
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 1>he was like a super nice guy.</v>

1440
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 1>But it was weird being friends with this dude while it was like a young</v>

1441
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:30.641
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>

1442
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause I always like thought of cops.</v>

1443
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:32.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1444
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:32.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1445
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.304
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get arrested.</v>

1446
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1447
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 1>think of all the people that I knew that were dirt bags like,</v>

1448
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:36.821
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1449
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:37.601
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

1450
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:38.434
<v Speaker 1>There's a cop,</v>

1451
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:38.801
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1452
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.120
<v Speaker 1>But he was,</v>

1453
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:40.954
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1454
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>he was older than me,</v>

1455
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1456
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird sort of a relationship because,</v>

1457
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1458
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.101
<v Speaker 1>he was older than me,</v>

1459
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:49.600
<v Speaker 1>but I was better at martial arts in him.</v>

1460
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So I beat his ass.</v>

1461
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But he was a cop and then he'd arrest you.</v>

1462
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Well you didn't arrest me,</v>

1463
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1464
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I would like,</v>

1465
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I would even take it easy on them sometime in sparring because it was a cop</v>

1466
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 1>because I would just think like,</v>

1467
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I do not want this dude like developing a grudge,</v>

1468
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1469
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1470
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause people could develop a grudge,</v>

1471
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.953
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1472
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And especially like the Ma like sparring sessions,</v>

1473
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1474
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.370
<v Speaker 1>there's like sparring sessions for striking and then sparring sessions for</v>

1475
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 1>grappling sparring sessions for grappling are way safer.</v>

1476
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 1>So you can go really,</v>

1477
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>really go at it hard,</v>

1478
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but sparring sessions for,</v>

1479
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 1>for striking,</v>

1480
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 1>they're really dangerous because if people get knocked out all the time,</v>

1481
00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:32.770
<v Speaker 1>so this is like a certain amount of respect that you have to give each other and</v>

1482
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to not hit each other that hard.</v>

1483
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.040
<v Speaker 1>And some guys just don't play by that.</v>

1484
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:36.874
<v Speaker 1>Some guys would just,</v>

1485
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.950
<v Speaker 1>it all goes out the window and start winging shots at you.</v>

1486
00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:39.551
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

1487
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:40.660
<v Speaker 1>you're in a melee.</v>

1488
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it happens all the time.</v>

1489
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 1>We're a sparring session,</v>

1490
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:45.280
<v Speaker 1>turns into an all out fight.</v>

1491
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>

1492
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So he don't want to do that with a cop,</v>

1493
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:49.643
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1494
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's especially a cop that it knows how to fight.</v>

1495
00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good to see the John Jones thing.</v>

1496
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1497
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:55.801
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy,</v>

1498
00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:56.634
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1499
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier had gotten this huge scrap at a press conference.</v>

1500
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:01.663
<v Speaker 1>It was Rick Delaws,</v>

1501
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.591
<v Speaker 1>John Jones,</v>

1502
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:02.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1503
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>gotten dangle crummy aids face,</v>

1504
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 1>put his forehead on Daniel Cormier forehead.</v>

1505
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Daniel called me,</v>

1506
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 1>had grabbed John Jones by the neck and pushed him away and John dropped his</v>

1507
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:11.111
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

1508
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>And then it was just bodies colliding.</v>

1509
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1510
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And John,</v>

1511
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>immediately I cast,</v>

1512
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1513
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:18.971
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1514
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:20.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild scramble,</v>

1515
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.870
<v Speaker 1>but John was on top and John was like,</v>

1516
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I took you down so quick.</v>

1517
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Within seven seconds you were on your back.</v>

1518
00:41:25.871 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1519
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.041
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

1520
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Like the shit talking,</v>

1521
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 1>just escalate it to a totally different level.</v>

1522
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And John Jones put out a video that said,</v>

1523
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1524
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.041
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1525
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:34.671
<v Speaker 1>you suck.</v>

1526
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>You're so weak.</v>

1527
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 1>When I got ahold of you felt so weak.</v>

1528
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:38.991
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really,</v>

1529
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and then he deleted the video,</v>

1530
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>

1531
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:41.861
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1532
00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:42.694
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

1533
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1534
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 1>poor guy in the middle.</v>

1535
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1536
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:47.190
<v Speaker 1>That guy there.</v>

1537
00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 1>This is just a collide.</v>

1538
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1539
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Pile of bodies.</v>

1540
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Dan is on vacation.</v>

1541
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:52.694
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even there.</v>

1542
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 1>This can't happen.</v>

1544
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

1545
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 1>This is real bad for the sport.</v>

1546
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's real bad.</v>

1547
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It's real bad for public perception.</v>

1548
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.531
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1549
00:42:03.531 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 1>a weapon to be used against MMA.</v>

1550
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:07.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1551
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate,</v>

1552
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:13.080
<v Speaker 1>which you've got to have everybody should have is uh,</v>

1553
00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 1>a no contact policy unless guys agree to hug,</v>

1554
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:17.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you agree to shake hands and hug.</v>

1556
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 1>You should have a no contact policy and anybody clearly violates that no contact</v>

1557
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 1>policy gets fined.</v>

1558
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 1>You know that some guys can deal with it that getting in each other's face.</v>

1559
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 1>But when you have a situation like this,</v>

1560
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to have to have a no contact policy with those guys.</v>

1562
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.361
<v Speaker 1>The weigh ins,</v>

1563
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 1>they're always doing the foreheads stuff and I get it in people's face that's</v>

1564
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:39.104
<v Speaker 1>like know man.</v>

1565
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

1566
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.511
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1567
00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And some of it's gamesmanship,</v>

1568
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so bad for the image of the sport.</v>

1569
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that starting to happen more often?</v>

1570
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1571
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.893
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty rare.</v>

1572
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.441
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rare.</v>

1573
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But that's a big high profile fight.</v>

1574
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean like Rhonda Rousey and me should,</v>

1575
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 1>they got head to head and each of those phases and it was,</v>

1576
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.393
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty hot,</v>

1577
00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.053
<v Speaker 1>I saw were there.</v>

1578
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:01.603
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1579
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 1>they were professional about it.</v>

1580
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do anything about it.</v>

1581
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 1>These guys were not professional.</v>

1582
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like immediate.</v>

1583
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1584
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1585
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:10.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1586
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 1>he can't grab each other and fucking slap,</v>

1587
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.251
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1588
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:13.911
<v Speaker 1>And if you say,</v>

1589
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:14.271
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1590
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to head but you man,</v>

1591
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1592
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1593
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to give ground,</v>

1594
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.053
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

1596
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.291
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

1597
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:21.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1598
00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:24.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't want anybody getting any psychological advantage and so they're</v>

1599
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1600
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.110
<v Speaker 1>They have to show each other like they'll fuck,</v>

1601
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking fight you right here.</v>

1602
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.773
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

1603
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 1>that's when shit like this happens.</v>

1604
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like they just have to treat it.</v>

1605
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>

1606
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1607
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:38.360
<v Speaker 1>like the importance of that not happening is huge to huge.</v>

1608
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.243
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1609
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a negative connotation attached to what that is.</v>

1610
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 1>That's just violence.</v>

1611
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 1>The difference between that kind of violence and the violence of a sport is the</v>

1612
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 1>violence of a sport is everyone's agreeing to this scenario.</v>

1613
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You're agreeing to train for x amount of weeks.</v>

1614
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fight for x amount of rounds.</v>

1615
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fight this guy.</v>

1616
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 1>He weighs what you weigh.</v>

1617
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody prepares,</v>

1618
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you meet at this day and you compete.</v>

1619
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very dangerous form of competition.</v>

1620
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:05.691
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

1621
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it is fighting as a competition,</v>

1622
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's not violence the same way that that is.</v>

1623
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a street fight.</v>

1624
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1625
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a world champion.</v>

1626
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Mixed martial arts fighter and an Olympic wrestler and there's street fighting.</v>

1627
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for everybody.</v>

1628
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for wrestling.</v>

1629
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for MMA.</v>

1630
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for sports.</v>

1631
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fun for people to watch,</v>

1632
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1633
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.063
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1634
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1635
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.001
<v Speaker 1>was part of me.</v>

1636
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I have two,</v>

1637
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.500
<v Speaker 1>two ways of looking at it.</v>

1638
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Part of is like that's bad for the sport,</v>

1639
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 1>but pardon me is like how do I feel about it though?</v>

1640
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Does it bum me out?</v>

1641
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1642
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.431
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1643
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me upset.</v>

1644
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not upset.</v>

1645
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to watching this fight even more now.</v>

1646
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:43.441
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1647
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:43.771
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1648
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I have liked it to non happen.</v>

1649
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1650
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.071
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1651
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I wish that they were very professional about this.</v>

1652
00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:49.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to do that.</v>

1653
00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That fight is going to be amazing no matter what happens.</v>

1654
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.830
<v Speaker 1>But since it did happen and I got to see it,</v>

1655
00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:55.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1656
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1657
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pretend that that's not fun.</v>

1658
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1659
00:44:58.341 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pretend that that didn't make everybody way more excited about</v>

1660
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that fight cause it fucking for sure did.</v>

1661
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1662
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>

1663
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to do,</v>

1664
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was fun to watch and more people are going to be excited about the fight.</v>

1665
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1666
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:14.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the catch 22 that's,</v>

1667
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 1>there's no real black or white about this,</v>

1668
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:17.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1669
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 1>as a representative of the sport.</v>

1670
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely wish it didn't happen as a,</v>

1671
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 1>a person who cares a lot about the future of the sport and the public's</v>

1672
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:26.431
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

1673
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 1>which I think is already a little skewed.</v>

1674
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that aren't fans that like to look at the people</v>

1675
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that fight in him MMA.</v>

1676
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just barbarians.</v>

1677
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

1678
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.430
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of Nice guys that fight in the UFC and there are some of the</v>

1679
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 1>nicest athletes you'll ever meet.</v>

1680
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.213
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

1681
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.240
<v Speaker 1>So pardon me.</v>

1682
00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 1>He gets bummed out when I see shit like that,</v>

1683
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but part of me is like,</v>

1684
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:46.621
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1685
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:48.690
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fight eventually anyway.</v>

1686
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.110
<v Speaker 3>A little here.</v>

1687
00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Being passionate,</v>

1688
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:53.544
<v Speaker 3>a little taste,</v>

1689
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>get a little taste.</v>

1690
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1691
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a wild ass fight though.</v>

1692
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.393
<v Speaker 1>When is that fight?</v>

1693
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1694
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1695
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:01.933
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1696
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's September 27th in Vegas.</v>

1697
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that it or is the weekend of the 27th,</v>

1698
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:08.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1699
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>either way it's on like donkey Kong.</v>

1700
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:12.383
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1701
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be exciting,</v>

1702
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's unfortunate man.</v>

1703
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate.</v>

1704
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 3>So as far as now they didn't get in any trouble.</v>

1705
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean I read that that there is that they were going to get in trouble.</v>

1708
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 3>There's some thing in that contract,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know that you can't do that shit.</v>

1710

<v Speaker 3>No</v>

1711
00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.920
<v Speaker 1>thing that says there'll be consequences.</v>

1712
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:37.503
<v Speaker 1>That's the statement.</v>

1713
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 1>The official statement.</v>

1714
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.270
<v Speaker 1>There will be consequences.</v>

1715
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.930
<v Speaker 3>It's almost scary or that was,</v>

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:44.121
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1717

1720
00:46:46.881 --> 00:46:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it'd be consequences to actions.</v>

1721
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't get any of the headphones to wear during the fights.</v>

1722
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Have you been watching the strain?</v>

1723
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.700
<v Speaker 3>You've been watching the strain</v>

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 3>that could totally be a story.</v>

1875
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 3>They could do that creature from the black and to be in Miami,</v>

1876
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking people up in Miami because you need the hot girls to kill.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1884
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.620

1885
00:51:59.621 --> 00:52:01.040
<v Speaker 3>whether being chased by a lizard man.</v>

1886
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.040
<v Speaker 7>That's what you could count on with all those Jason Movies where you're like in</v>

1887
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:09.030
<v Speaker 7>the first scene he's going to be walking through some camp and there's going to</v>

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Shondra is kind of,</v>

1896
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that genre is kind of gone away a bit.</v>

1897
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1898
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.093

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Friday the 13th all those movies.</v>

1903
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Those are big movies man.</v>

1904
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you get fired up Friday 30th Freddy Krueger.</v>

1905
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Even when they were bad,</v>

1906
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:39.130
<v Speaker 3>they were good.</v>

1907
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:39.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1908
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

1909
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:45.130
<v Speaker 3>if you could ensure that a couple of girls would be having a pillow fight and it</v>

1910
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:47.660
<v Speaker 3>tit would pop out and the ax murderer shows up.</v>

1911
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:48.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1912
00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.660
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about that for two months with your friends if you're a teenager.</v>

1913
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1914
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's like Jason Cause he's,</v>

1915
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 3>he's on dead or whatever it is.</v>

1916
00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows what he is.</v>

1917
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1918
00:52:57.051 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 3>He was killed and then came back so they fucking run them over.</v>

1919
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:01.154
<v Speaker 3>They shoot him,</v>

1920
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 3>rises and somehow or another finds a way to get you</v>

1921
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:05.310
<v Speaker 7>and it didn't even matter back.</v>

1922
00:53:05.311 --> 00:53:05.451
<v Speaker 7>Then.</v>

1923
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:05.701
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

1924
00:53:05.701 --> 00:53:05.911
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1925
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:08.970
<v Speaker 7>we have to explain to the viewers how he came back to like,</v>

1926
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:12.870
<v Speaker 7>well that's what does like four pairs of tits or for immediately there forget.</v>

1927
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.750
<v Speaker 7>Then it just goes on a rampage for two hours.</v>

1928
00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.460
<v Speaker 7>It was a different world back then.</v>

1929
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.290
<v Speaker 7>Scream movies were good.</v>

1930
00:53:19.291 --> 00:53:20.370
<v Speaker 7>I thought the scream.</v>

1931
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1932
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.073
<v Speaker 7>those were good.</v>

1933
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.010
<v Speaker 7>Those are fun.</v>

1934
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:24.120
<v Speaker 7>It took a lot from those,</v>

1935
00:53:24.121 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 7>that old school of horror slasher</v>

1936
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.113
<v Speaker 3>film thing.</v>

1937
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 3>What bums me out is the lack of monster movies.</v>

1938
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 3>That's a bums me out.</v>

1939
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever a good monster movie comes out,</v>

1940
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 3>I get like super excited.</v>

1941
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:34.961
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1942
00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be fun,</v>

1943
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 3>but there's so few.</v>

1944

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:42.924
<v Speaker 3>it was fun.</v>

1947
00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1948
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 3>It was really well done.</v>

1949
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Like the gods ill itself is amazing,</v>

1950
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.230

<v Speaker 3>The main dude who survives more close calls,</v>

1953
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 3>this goddamn movie than anybody in the history of monster movies.</v>

1962
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the movie,</v>

1977
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.601
<v Speaker 3>it makes it worth,</v>

1978
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 3>it makes it worth seeing because even if the story is goofy as Shit,</v>

2015
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:14.343
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2016
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.540
<v Speaker 3>I liked that one.</v>

2017
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.940
<v Speaker 3>She really giant robots going at it.</v>

2018
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:21.870
<v Speaker 3>It was like watching a video game.</v>

2019
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 3>It was cool.</v>

2020
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.241
<v Speaker 3>That part was cool.</v>

2021
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:24.551
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2022
00:55:24.551 --> 00:55:24.940
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2023
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:25.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2024
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:30.160
<v Speaker 3>the human parts were portable and it really felt like I was watching someone</v>

2025
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:35.391
<v Speaker 3>like took a comic book and just didn't do any rewrites it all and just slapped</v>

2026
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 3>it together.</v>

2027
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It was very comic book live,</v>

2028
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:38.371
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2029
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2030
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I think in some cases is fine,</v>

2031
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 3>but the comic books that they're doing,</v>

2032
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 3>not comic book movies,</v>

2033
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>they do so well.</v>

2034
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Like captain America,</v>

2035
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:46.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2036
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 3>it's silly story,</v>

2037
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good,</v>

2038
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.940
<v Speaker 3>they do a really good job.</v>

2039
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Like they make these movies are fun to watch.</v>

2040
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>They do a great job.</v>

2041
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 3>So like if you go back to like really clunky sort of like stuff like that,</v>

2042
00:55:59.041 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

2043
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.600
<v Speaker 3>the Pacific thing,</v>

2044
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.011
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

2045
00:56:01.011 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2046
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:02.550
<v Speaker 3>it was too clunky for me.</v>

2047
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:03.623
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

2048
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2049
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Store like storywise yeah.</v>

2050
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:06.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2051
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:07.284
<v Speaker 3>That I didn't even,</v>

2052
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2053
00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to go watch a movie and turned my brain off.</v>

2054
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:10.141
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2055
00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 3>what better thing to watch?</v>

2056
00:56:11.131 --> 00:56:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Like 200 foot tall robots destroy each other.</v>

2057
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 3>But there was a seam in this like guy and a grower in love with each other or</v>

2058
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:17.611
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2059
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:18.001
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2060
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 3>what am I watching here?</v>

2061
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:19.741
<v Speaker 3>What kind of,</v>

2062
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:19.861
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2063
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:20.520
<v Speaker 3>That's where you're like,</v>

2064
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:20.641
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2065
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:22.760
<v Speaker 3>bathroom time or cigarette or something.</v>

2066
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 3>What is this robot</v>

2067
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.323
<v Speaker 1>fight thing?</v>

2068
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.253
<v Speaker 1>What are you guys doing?</v>

2069
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:26.861
<v Speaker 1>What's happening here?</v>

2070
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:27.694
<v Speaker 1>Where's the monsters?</v>

2071
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2072
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:28.661
<v Speaker 1>show me some monsters,</v>

2073
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:29.494
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

2074
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I hated the acting.</v>

2075
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:31.391
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2076
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2077
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even watch it.</v>

2078
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:34.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2079
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:34.931
<v Speaker 1>but seems like they,</v>

2080
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a choice though.</v>

2081
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 1>It seemed very comic book like right.</v>

2082
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Didn't it?</v>

2083
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Almost like they were going for like a certain,</v>

2084
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.383
<v Speaker 1>a certain feel.</v>

2085
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:43.751
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2086
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 7>How did that like comic book video game feel exactly like,</v>

2087
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 7>I don't even remember who was in it.</v>

2088
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 7>Not The human beings that were in it.</v>

2089
00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2090
00:56:52.221 --> 00:56:54.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember I got really mad when I finally watched that movie because everyone</v>

2091
00:56:54.801 --> 00:56:55.670
<v Speaker 1>told me it was good.</v>

2092
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.560
<v Speaker 1>That fucking Tom Cruise movies.</v>

2093
00:56:57.561 --> 00:56:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2094
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:59.450
<v Speaker 1>The the latest one.</v>

2095
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2096
00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.453
<v Speaker 1>the edge of tomorrow.</v>

2097
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:02.743
<v Speaker 1>What's that one about?</v>

2098
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a science fiction movie.</v>

2099
00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:04.761
<v Speaker 1>It's really good,</v>

2100
00:57:04.761 --> 00:57:05.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2101
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.983
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

2102
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean I said it's really good and a bunch of people criticized me online.</v>

2103
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.863
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

2104
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.690
<v Speaker 1>But I think that those people you to movie sucks.</v>

2105
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

2106
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just my taste.</v>

2107
00:57:16.521 --> 00:57:16.971
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2108
00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:18.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it sucks.</v>

2109
00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

2110
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:19.760
<v Speaker 1>we liked different things,</v>

2111
00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.041
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2112
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I understand if you think the movie sucks to you,</v>

2113
00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but to me I thought it was excellent it,</v>

2114
00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.810
<v Speaker 1>and if it wasn't Tom Cruise,</v>

2115
00:57:26.811 --> 00:57:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I think if it was some other dude that didn't carry a lot of baggage,</v>

2116
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd probably been braided a lot higher than it was.</v>

2117
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why people are like,</v>

2118
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2119
00:57:35.391 --> 00:57:36.260
<v Speaker 1>the movie wasn't that good.</v>

2120
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's because it's a Tom cruise movie.</v>

2121
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I think like Tom Cruise is moving movies.</v>

2122
00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:42.770
<v Speaker 1>People think they're good,</v>

2123
00:57:42.771 --> 00:57:43.401
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty good.</v>

2124
00:57:43.401 --> 00:57:44.234
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

2125
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:47.150
<v Speaker 1>But if it was like another actor in the same role,</v>

2126
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:47.871
<v Speaker 1>like they wouldn't,</v>

2127
00:57:47.871 --> 00:57:49.610
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be judged the same way I think.</v>

2128
00:57:49.611 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I think people just think that guy is so wacky.</v>

2129
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2130
00:57:52.011 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 1>It's reputation proceeds.</v>

2131
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Anything else they can do from now on?</v>

2132
00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:55.461
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2133
00:57:55.461 --> 00:57:55.821
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

2134
00:57:55.821 --> 00:57:56.690
<v Speaker 1>he's so,</v>

2135
00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:58.423
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

2136
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's really good actor.</v>

2137
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.480
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking really good in this movie.</v>

2138
00:58:02.481 --> 00:58:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you buy it like a,</v>

2139
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away the plot,</v>

2140
00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:05.801
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

2141
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty ridiculous plot and he sells it.</v>

2142
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea behind it is pretty crazy and he sells it.</v>

2143
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.483
<v Speaker 7>It people moving.</v>

2144
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.420
<v Speaker 7>People forget like there's a reason he became the biggest movie star in the</v>

2145
00:58:17.421 --> 00:58:18.230
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

2146
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2147
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:19.430
<v Speaker 7>It's cute.</v>

2148
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.263
<v Speaker 7>It's got a cute face.</v>

2149
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:20.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2150
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:21.080
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2151
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.010
<v Speaker 7>he's talented.</v>

2152
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:24.410
<v Speaker 7>He's talented as fuck.</v>

2153
00:58:24.411 --> 00:58:25.490
<v Speaker 7>Just happens to be insane.</v>

2154
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:26.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2155
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that everybody who's really good at that Gig is insane.</v>

2156
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an insane person's hobby or insane person's profession.</v>

2157
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2158
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:35.391
<v Speaker 1>they're really good ones.</v>

2159
00:58:35.391 --> 00:58:37.310

2160
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:38.953
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2161
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 7>that's like the difficult trick it seems for celebrities now is to not let it</v>

2162
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.550
<v Speaker 7>out crazy.</v>

2163
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.381
<v Speaker 7>Cause there's so many.</v>

2164
00:58:46.381 --> 00:58:47.380

2170
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:56.621
<v Speaker 7>And it was,</v>

2171
00:58:56.621 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 7>that's all been there.</v>

2172
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:59.260
<v Speaker 7>We just didn't know.</v>

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:48.683
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2205
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Fatty Arbuckle.</v>

2206
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:56.210
<v Speaker 1>His name is Roscoe Roscoe Arbuckle.</v>

2207
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2208
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:58.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2209
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

2210
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2211
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>the woman died four days later.</v>

2212
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>She fallen ill at a party and she died.</v>

2213
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:12.923
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2214
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>He was accused by,</v>

2215
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2216
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>this woman's a acquaintance of accidentally killing the woman and after the</v>

2217
01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>first two trials,</v>

2218
01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>which resulted in hung juries,</v>

2219
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written apology</v>

2220
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:30.404
<v Speaker 1>from the jury.</v>

2221
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Despite Arbuckle's acquittal,</v>

2222
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>the scandal has most overshadow,</v>

2223
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian falling the trials,</v>

2224
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>his films where banned and he was publicly ostracized,</v>

2225
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>although the ban and his films was lifted within a year.</v>

2226
01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Our buckle only works sparingly through the 1920s.</v>

2227
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>He later worked as a film director under the alias William Goodrich.</v>

2228
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>He was finally able to return to acting,</v>

2229
01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>making two short real comedies in 1932 for Warner brothers.</v>

2230
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>He died and they sleep of a heart attack at the age of 46.</v>

2231
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:04.663
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2232
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Reportedly on the same day,</v>

2233
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>sign a contract with Warner brothers to make a feature film.</v>

2234
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.131
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

2235
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2236
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say here what he did,</v>

2237
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't get into graphic detail about it.</v>

2238
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.293
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2239
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Just said she had fallen ill.</v>

2240
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.453
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

2241
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:24.231
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:01:24.231 --> 01:01:25.010
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if they,</v>

2243
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.690
<v Speaker 7>how old is that story?</v>

2244
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.651
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2245
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>it's from 1921.</v>

2246
01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:31.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2247
01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.403
<v Speaker 7>I guess I don't,</v>

2248
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 7>I doubt they printed stuff like that back then.</v>

2249
01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.453
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.680
<v Speaker 7>Like anything that alluded to sexual whatever,</v>

2251
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:39.401
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

2252
01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:39.580
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2253
01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.420
<v Speaker 7>she was ill,</v>

2254
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.550
<v Speaker 7>but they wouldn't even use the word pregnant.</v>

2255
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.350
<v Speaker 7>They'd be like expecting,</v>

2256
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and they're saying that he wasn't that big,</v>

2257
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.261
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

2258
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>what the charge was that he had killed her with his weight while savagely raping</v>

2259
01:01:52.991 --> 01:01:53.171
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

2260
01:01:53.171 --> 01:01:58.171
<v Speaker 1>It says that the newspapers of the day reveled in the glory rumor details.</v>

2261
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Juries found little evidence that Arbuckle wasn't any way connected with her</v>

2262
01:02:03.071 --> 01:02:03.904
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

2263
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.693
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

2264
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:08.651
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:02:08.651 --> 01:02:12.430
<v Speaker 7>Imagine how many more of those stories about those like old legends that were</v>

2266
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:14.890
<v Speaker 7>like considered pristine stars.</v>

2267
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.170
<v Speaker 7>And if there was a TMZ back then.</v>

2268
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2269
01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:18.891
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>

2270
01:02:18.891 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of different versions.</v>

2271
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Like his,</v>

2272
01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2273
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>this one website has,</v>

2274
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2275
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>one person's version and then the fatty Arbuckle vars,</v>

2276
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>they're two different versions of what exactly happened.</v>

2277
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>You know Boyan on my friend.</v>

2278
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:34.643
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked.</v>

2279
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:35.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:02:35.991 --> 01:02:37.490
<v Speaker 3>How did we get on the subject of Fatty Arbuckle?</v>

2281
01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:38.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2282
01:02:38.991 --> 01:02:41.150
<v Speaker 3>it's because Tom Cruise is considered crazy.</v>

2283
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Like they probably were a bunch of crazy.</v>

2284
01:02:43.491 --> 01:02:44.840
<v Speaker 3>There's always been crazy celebrity.</v>

2285
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:47.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why it was crazy.</v>

2286
01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

2287
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:48.890
<v Speaker 3>People are crazy.</v>

2288
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:52.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just that people done a really good job of hiding their crazy until they</v>

2289
01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.330
<v Speaker 3>shut their doors.</v>

2290
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.651
<v Speaker 3>They would get home.</v>

2291
01:02:54.651 --> 01:02:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Can I take care of it by shut that door and</v>

2292
01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.993

2293
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 3>ball gag in place.</v>

2297
01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.613
<v Speaker 1>basement.</v>

2302
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:15.783
<v Speaker 1>It's coming out more.</v>

2303
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.670
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great when people want to go back to privacy,</v>

2304
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:22.160
<v Speaker 3>when they want to cherish their privacy,</v>

2305
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.983
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen.</v>

2306
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.240
<v Speaker 3>He'd have to go somewhere like the big island of Hawaii.</v>

2307
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.583
<v Speaker 3>No Internet.</v>

2308
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.120
<v Speaker 3>There's no internet.</v>

2309
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.391
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2310
01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could,</v>

2311
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you would live there with no internet.</v>

2312
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2313
01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.201
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2314
01:03:32.201 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 3>And there is Internet in the big islands.</v>

2315
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

2316
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.080
<v Speaker 3>But if you really want to,</v>

2317
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.681
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2318
01:03:36.681 --> 01:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>think about the fact that there's Internet on the big,</v>

2319
01:03:38.421 --> 01:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking Hawaii,</v>

2320
01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.950
<v Speaker 3>it takes five hours to get there on a plane.</v>

2321
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.311
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2322
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:48.311
<v Speaker 3>You fly through the air for five hours and someone laid fiber across the ocean</v>

2323
01:03:49.341 --> 01:03:50.090
<v Speaker 3>floor.</v>

2324
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:51.260
<v Speaker 3>That is that length.</v>

2325
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how it works,</v>

2326
01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:53.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2327
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2328
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

2329
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.813
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that how it works?</v>

2330
01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Like there has to be a direct line.</v>

2331
01:03:57.471 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Some under water lines.</v>

2332
01:03:59.091 --> 01:04:00.890
<v Speaker 3>There's underwater line son.</v>

2333
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.300
<v Speaker 3>How exactly,</v>

2334
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 3>how did they do that?</v>

2335
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.120
<v Speaker 3>The Pacific Ocean.</v>

2336
01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:08.810
<v Speaker 3>So they just like were tossing this in there and let's help like a shark doesn't</v>

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:11.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna Google.</v>

2341
01:04:11.421 --> 01:04:13.430
<v Speaker 3>How do they get Internet in Hawaii</v>

2342
01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.900

<v Speaker 3>It's one of the first things that people ask.</v>

2346
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:22.671
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what they say.</v>

2347
01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:23.081
<v Speaker 3>How does it,</v>

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Yahoo Answers.</v>

2351
01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:30.790
<v Speaker 3>The unit is provided via a 10,000 miles sub marine and terrestrial fiber optic</v>

2352
01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:35.150
<v Speaker 3>cable connecting the state.</v>

2353
01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Six major islands,</v>

2354
01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.770
<v Speaker 3>which is owned and operated by Pacific light net.</v>

2355
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.053
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2356
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>10,000 miles,</v>

2357
01:04:42.231 --> 01:04:43.064
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2358
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.050
<v Speaker 3>So there are like cables connecting all the continence.</v>

2359
01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:48.663
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2360
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.533
<v Speaker 3>That's how,</v>

2361
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:50.231
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2362
01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:51.240
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2363
01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:53.350
<v Speaker 3>And if you think about that,</v>

2364
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.600
<v Speaker 3>like what part of that?</v>

2365
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know like that,</v>

2366
01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.690
<v Speaker 3>that part we don't know.</v>

2367
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Like most people aren't like wait a minute.</v>

2368
01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 3>It's all a why there's wires everywhere.</v>

2369
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.420
<v Speaker 3>People don't think of that.</v>

2370
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:05.321
<v Speaker 3>You don't think of that?</v>

2371
01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't think there's like a wire that goes across the ocean to England</v>

2372
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.830
<v Speaker 3>and that's how he's doing the inner signals flying through the air.</v>

2373
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.400
<v Speaker 3>The people building railroads were like this is impressive.</v>

2374
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.020
<v Speaker 3>We link this city,</v>

2375
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.830
<v Speaker 3>that one with all this steel.</v>

2376
01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2377
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And now it's like there's a cable where I can just like pick up a thing and send</v>

2378
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:23.500
<v Speaker 3>a thing.</v>

2379
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:23.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And just type of thing and watch a video.</v>

2381
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:26.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2382
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:26.741
<v Speaker 3>Screw you.</v>

2383
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Train two weeks.</v>

2384
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>That is why he gets really squirrely when people start talking about like,</v>

2385
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:32.464
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2386
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 3>when you start talking about like videos that you can and can't watch and other</v>

2387
01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 3>countries like why can't I watch this in South Africa?</v>

2388
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2389
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 3>why can't how come this is is because the pipe,</v>

2390
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:42.580
<v Speaker 3>like they don't have agreement with various pipes.</v>

2391
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean that must be it.</v>

2393
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2394
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Music licensing also mostly and things like that.</v>

2395
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:48.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Music licensing and I'm sure all</v>

2397
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>so like that there are certain places like they don't want to waste their</v>

2398
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth on a product that's not available in your country.</v>

2399
01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised terrorist is,</v>

2400
01:05:58.161 --> 01:05:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten after these lines.</v>

2401
01:05:59.511 --> 01:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.613
<v Speaker 2>That seems like</v>

2403
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>why are you giving them great ideas,</v>

2412
01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.790
<v Speaker 3>they change it from Isis again.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2415
01:06:18.021 --> 01:06:18.621

2416
01:06:18.621 --> 01:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>they would since I know about it.</v>

2417
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:20.471
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2418
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:21.304
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.010
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer secret.</v>

2421
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.093
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2422

<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

2423
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2424
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake on the last episode I was on when I saw the video of a Israeli,</v>

2425
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:34.751

2428
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's just a lot of videos that they're just saying they're Israelian</v>

2429
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.833
<v Speaker 2>and they're not,</v>

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.490
<v Speaker 3>that was a real video,</v>

2434
01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:46.971
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2435
01:06:46.971 --> 01:06:47.390

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.921
<v Speaker 3>angry juice.</v>

2447
01:07:00.921 --> 01:07:01.754
<v Speaker 3>Sweeties</v>

2448
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:03.123
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2449
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some sort of a cease fire right now.</v>

2450
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2451
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:05.973
<v Speaker 1>It's not the idea</v>

2452
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

2453
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.170
<v Speaker 2>unless it's already ended</v>

2454
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:09.900
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>

2455
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.190
<v Speaker 1>We were going to war with Mexico.</v>

2456
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:12.623
<v Speaker 1>Better not,</v>

2457
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>but think about it like that's essentially what's going on.</v>

2458
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Like if where,</v>

2459
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>where you look at where Israel is and you look at Gaza,</v>

2460
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>if that we were going to war with Mexico,</v>

2461
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that would be what it would be like,</v>

2462
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>like us going back and forth and rockets from Mexico flying into San Antonio and</v>

2463
01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:28.561
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

2464
01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:29.490
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2465
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2466
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.661
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

2467
01:07:30.661 --> 01:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Like that's really what it would be like.</v>

2468
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2469
01:07:32.851 --> 01:07:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they would like destroy a seven 11 and El Paso and then we would just like</v>

2470
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:40.470
<v Speaker 2>bomb all of Mexico City for like three straight days.</v>

2471
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's why the people in Israel,</v>

2472
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about people in Israel is those motherfuckers love to party.</v>

2473
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.093
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend,</v>

2475
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>it was a kickboxing instructor.</v>

2476
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I went over his house once for dinner and a dude is playing the bongos and his</v>

2477
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:54.341
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

2478
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>his dancing,</v>

2479
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>his kids were dancing and they were all cooking.</v>

2480
01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:57.731
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2481
01:07:57.731 --> 01:07:57.851
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2482
01:07:57.851 --> 01:07:58.684
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

2483
01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2484
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:00.701
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>

2485
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:01.181
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2486
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you know how we do it in Israel?</v>

2487
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2488
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>

2489
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 1>One day you die,</v>

2490
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:06.161
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2491
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So today when we lie party,</v>

2492
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:08.321
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

2493
01:08:08.321 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 1>party and it was like playing the Bongo drums and all happy,</v>

2494
01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:12.131
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2495
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2496
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a perspective you only get when you've,</v>

2497
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>you've been involved in that,</v>

2498
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>that sort of hellish existence.</v>

2499
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:20.511
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

2500
01:08:20.511 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was in the military for the Israeli army.</v>

2501
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's mandatory actually for everyone.</v>

2502
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:27.201
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2503
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2504
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2505
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:28.754
<v Speaker 1>and he was a,</v>

2506
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy,</v>

2507
01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>but always like big smile on his face and very happy.</v>

2508
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And that was his explanation.</v>

2509
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.071
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2510
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:37.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2511
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2512
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>how come you guys are always so happy when I meet someone who's that like</v>

2513
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:41.804
<v Speaker 1>exuberant?</v>

2514
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>That was his explanation.</v>

2515
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.443
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

2516
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:44.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2517
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you're over there.</v>

2518
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just like death,</v>

2519
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>like bombings.</v>

2520
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Something always terrible.</v>

2521
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

2522
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:52.183
<v Speaker 1>Everyone could die.</v>

2523
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 7>So she'll see Heidi.</v>

2524
01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 7>Patty had different life with like Israelis and Palestinians are cause it's like</v>

2525
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.170
<v Speaker 7>there's no way the Palestinians are partying like that.</v>

2526
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.731
<v Speaker 7>That's a good point.</v>

2527
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 7>I think they'd party twice as hard.</v>

2528
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.040
<v Speaker 7>Let's look.</v>

2529
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.710
<v Speaker 7>We're really living under like at any moment.</v>

2530
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.753
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2532
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 7>That's a dark situation,</v>

2533
01:09:11.271 --> 01:09:12.000
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2534
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.770
<v Speaker 7>It really is.</v>

2535
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:13.670
<v Speaker 7>It's very dark.</v>

2536
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 7>Like I asked my parents,</v>

2537
01:09:14.931 --> 01:09:15.680
<v Speaker 7>they're from Lebanon,</v>

2538
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.513
<v Speaker 7>my parents,</v>

2539
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.990
<v Speaker 7>it's like they grew up in,</v>

2540
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 7>around all that.</v>

2541
01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2542
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 7>they were like Christian,</v>

2543
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.841
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2544
01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:21.260
<v Speaker 7>so they,</v>

2545
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 7>they just got out of there.</v>

2546
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:22.401
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

2547
01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 7>we need to get out of here.</v>

2548
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 7>But every time I'd ask them about it,</v>

2549
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 7>they would just like,</v>

2550
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:26.421
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2551
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:29.000
<v Speaker 7>what do you think about what's going on in Israel and Gaza now?</v>

2552
01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:29.511
<v Speaker 7>All this stuff.</v>

2553
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 7>And they just look at me like,</v>

2554
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:31.770
<v Speaker 7>what do you mean and mean?</v>

2555
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.690
<v Speaker 7>What do you think's going to happen?</v>

2556
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.523
<v Speaker 7>And they're like,</v>

2557
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:36.440
<v Speaker 7>the same thing that's always going to happen is they're going to keep fighting</v>

2558
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.910
<v Speaker 7>and it's never going to end.</v>

2559
01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 7>But they just look at it like it's not even worth talking about.</v>

2560
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.140
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

2561
01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:44.311
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2562
01:09:44.311 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 7>it's really like dark and you're just like,</v>

2563
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.933
<v Speaker 7>good Lord.</v>

2564
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 7>Like they just got so used to it like growing up that like war is a thing.</v>

2565
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 7>Like I went to Lebanon when I was 13 I took a v like go back to the homeland</v>

2566
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:58.603
<v Speaker 7>kind of thing.</v>

2567
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 7>And like you're in the southern parts of the country and,</v>

2568
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 7>and I'd never seen anything like this growing up in the suburbs of La.</v>

2569
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:08.720
<v Speaker 7>But like you're sitting in a village and then there's like a guy tending like</v>

2570
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:09.231
<v Speaker 7>cattle,</v>

2571
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:10.220
<v Speaker 7>there's like goats.</v>

2572
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:15.610
<v Speaker 7>And then five minutes later a tank just drives through a dirt road in the</v>

2573
01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:16.694
<v Speaker 7>village.</v>

2574
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:18.710
<v Speaker 7>No one bats an eye,</v>

2575
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.670
<v Speaker 7>no one.</v>

2576
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:20.720
<v Speaker 7>But meanwhile I'm like,</v>

2577
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.801
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2578
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:22.551
<v Speaker 7>just pointing.</v>

2579
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm like that's it.</v>

2580
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 7>Tank.</v>

2581
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.101
<v Speaker 7>And they're like,</v>

2582
01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 7>yeah that happens like two,</v>

2583
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:26.954
<v Speaker 7>three times a day.</v>

2584
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 7>Like Israeli tanks and Lebanese tanks and there's soldiers with fully automatic</v>

2585
01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:37.040
<v Speaker 7>weapons walking through towns and that's just like a normal part of life.</v>

2586
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Well have you ever done a gig that's unlike a military town?</v>

2587
01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.363
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2588
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you do a,</v>

2591
01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:49.561
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

2592
01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a gig anywhere nearby,</v>

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see like military trucks,</v>

2595
01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.431
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see,</v>

2599
01:11:02.731 --> 01:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're close to that,</v>

2603
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:06.811
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2604
01:11:06.811 --> 01:11:07.644
<v Speaker 1>If you're not used to it,</v>

2608
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what a tank is.</v>

2609
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.810
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2610

<v Speaker 7>I mean to like find if there is any trouble.</v>

2613
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you saw that tank and then all of a sudden fucking alarms</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well that's getting shot at.</v>

2617
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.710
<v Speaker 7>That happened when we were like,</v>

2618
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.341
<v Speaker 7>we're slow.</v>

2619
01:11:28.341 --> 01:11:30.260
<v Speaker 7>We went to sleep in the village that night.</v>

2620
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:35.510
<v Speaker 7>The night before we went back up to the city in Beirut and like my younger</v>

2624
01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.680
<v Speaker 7>It's nothing to worry about it.</v>

2625
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.480
<v Speaker 7>Then the next day we were like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely true.</v>

2649
01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.200
<v Speaker 1>We're all stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh well how do I get out of this</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:12:59.411 --> 01:13:01.300
<v Speaker 7>That's where that term comes from to get these giant,</v>

<v Speaker 7>they get it and then nothing happens.</v>

2675
01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.493
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2676
01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:28.221
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2677
01:13:28.221 --> 01:13:29.054
<v Speaker 1>Genetics.</v>

2678
01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.710
<v Speaker 1>But you have to be a travel guy,</v>

2679
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:31.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2680
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2681
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.903
<v Speaker 1>we have to.</v>

2682
01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just get a little bit of Ebola every day,</v>

2683
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:36.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2684
01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and develop an immunity to it.</v>

2685
01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2686
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a hemorrhagic virus,</v>

2687
01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:40.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2688
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:41.631
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it one of those?</v>

2689
01:13:41.631 --> 01:13:42.464
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2690
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those ones that makes you bleed.</v>

2691
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2692
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:48.350
<v Speaker 1>is it the same one that like liquefies or insights?</v>

2693
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Something bad like that.</v>

2694
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:50.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

2695
01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Liquified not good and they just sent some,</v>

2696
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:56.180
<v Speaker 1>they just sent someone to America,</v>

2697
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:56.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2698
01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:58.160
<v Speaker 1>To people to Atlanta.</v>

2699
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:13:59.361 --> 01:14:01.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a hemorrhagic fever.</v>

2701
01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a human disease caused by the Ebola virus.</v>

2702
01:14:04.461 --> 01:14:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Symptoms typically start two to three weeks after two days to three weeks after</v>

2703
01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:10.940
<v Speaker 1>contracting the virus with a fever,</v>

2704
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:11.501
<v Speaker 1>throat,</v>

2705
01:14:11.501 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 1>muscle pains and headaches.</v>

2706
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Typically nausea,</v>

2707
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>vomiting and diarrhea.</v>

2708
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Follow along with the decreased functioning of the liver and kidneys.</v>

2709
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.021
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

2710
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>some people begin to have bleeding problems.</v>

2711
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>The virus may be acquired upon contact with blood or bodily fluids of an</v>

2712
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>infected animal,</v>

2713
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 1>commonly monkeys or fruit bats.</v>

2714
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So somebody fucked a bat or a monkey and that's how we got it,</v>

2715
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but most likely so he got super crazy and fucked a monkey or a bat.</v>

2716
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>It's unnaturally transmitted through the air.</v>

2717
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Fruit bats are believed to carry and spread the virus without being effected.</v>

2718
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.033
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2719
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Once human infection occurs,</v>

2720
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the disease may spread between people as well.</v>

2721
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:53.791
<v Speaker 1>Male survivors may be able to transmit the disease via seaman for nearly two</v>

2722
01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:55.174
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

2723
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2724
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.580
<v Speaker 1>In order to make the diagnosis.</v>

2725
01:14:57.581 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Typically other disease with similar symptoms such as malaria,</v>

2726
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:02.403
<v Speaker 1>cholera,</v>

2727
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:06.760
<v Speaker 1>and other viral hemorrhagic fevers are first excluded.</v>

2728
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.493
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2729
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 1>This is deep shit,</v>

2730
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.234
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2731
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 1>No special,</v>

2732
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 1>no specific treatment for the disease.</v>

2733
01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] efforts to help persons who are in fact include giving them either</v>

2734
01:15:17.441 --> 01:15:19.270
<v Speaker 1>oral rehydration therapy,</v>

2735
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 1>slightly sweet and salt,</v>

2736
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.180
<v Speaker 1>slightly water to a slightly salty water to drink or intravenous fluids.</v>

2737
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 1>The disease has a high mortality rate,</v>

2738
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:32.230
<v Speaker 1>often killing between 50 and 90% of those infected whoa,</v>

2739
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.753
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2740
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It was first identified in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,</v>

2741
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.700
<v Speaker 1>the disease typically occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions of the Subsaharan</v>

2742
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.831
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

2743
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's always Africa.</v>

2744
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It's always Africa.</v>

2745
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>That's where whatever gets us is going to get out of Africa.</v>

2746
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2747
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:52.561
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2748
01:15:52.561 --> 01:15:52.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2749
01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I did that Scifi show,</v>

2750
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 1>that was the scariest part was the dealing with the infectious diseases by far</v>

2751
01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:00.190
<v Speaker 1>what asked people about diseases,</v>

2752
01:16:00.191 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 1>like what we really have to worry about.</v>

2753
01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>The scariest thing they were saying wasn't terrorism.</v>

2754
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It was just a disease that morphs just something that becomes like super potent</v>

2755
01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 1>and kills a ton of people.</v>

2756
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Something like they had that Spanish flu that it killed a bunch of people in the</v>

2757
01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>early 19 hundreds.</v>

2758
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 1>The 1920s or whatever.</v>

2760
01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And apparently it started on the military base Q,</v>

2762
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the conspiracy theories.</v>

2763
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:24.423
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2764
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2765
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:25.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2766
01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2767
01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:26.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2768
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was really deadly about it was that it would go after young</v>

2769
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 1>healthy men,</v>

2770
01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:31.751
<v Speaker 1>that it would,</v>

2771
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:33.150
<v Speaker 1>people with strong immune systems.</v>

2772
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It would shut down their immune system.</v>

2773
01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>It would like,</v>

2774
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 1>it would kill them quick,</v>

2775
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 1>which is like really strange.</v>

2776
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You know that it like it was almost designed to take out healthy people.</v>

2777
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.261
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2778
01:16:43.261 --> 01:16:44.430
<v Speaker 7>Cause normally a flu is,</v>

2779
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.860
<v Speaker 7>it's like children and old people.</v>

2780
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2782
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Babies and old people have to worry about it,</v>

2783
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but most young people survive.</v>

2784
01:16:52.071 --> 01:16:52.904
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

2785
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2786
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a creepy thought that at any time something could happen and some virus</v>

2787
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 1>could morph and turn it into some new thing that we don't know how to deal with.</v>

2788
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:04.021
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:17:04.021 --> 01:17:06.300
<v Speaker 7>And someone's sneezing on you at an airport.</v>

2790
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:06.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2791
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:09.060
<v Speaker 7>Wipe out 5% of human civilization</v>

2792
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>about this Ebola,</v>

2793
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>90% of the people die.</v>

2794
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2795
01:17:14.181 --> 01:17:15.200
<v Speaker 1>If that's the high number.</v>

2796
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>What if everyone got Ebola?</v>

2797
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Just think of that.</v>

2798
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 1>If one person get Ebola,</v>

2799
01:17:19.491 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>what's to say that everyone can't get Ebola while,</v>

2800
01:17:21.741 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 1>because there were specific protocols in place.</v>

2801
01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Stop that from yes,</v>

2802
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

2803
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being crazy.</v>

2804
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.893
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

2805
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not going to get Ebola,</v>

2806
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but if they did,</v>

2807
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 1>what we're saying is at least halfway die.</v>

2808
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2809
01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2810
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>that's some catastrophic shit.</v>

2811
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.520
<v Speaker 7>It's like with the way the world is interconnected,</v>

2812
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 7>it's like that could like Tsa doesn't check for Ebola,</v>

2813
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 7>like it could get through an airport and the next thing you know,</v>

2814
01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:49.350
<v Speaker 1>oh well listen to what that just said,</v>

2815
01:17:49.351 --> 01:17:50.184
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't,</v>

2816
01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily,</v>

2817
01:17:51.211 --> 01:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>the symptoms don't show up that quickly.</v>

2818
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Two days to three weeks.</v>

2819
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Three weeks is a long time.</v>

2820
01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 1>You contract a virus and then you,</v>

2821
01:18:00.671 --> 01:18:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you have that virus for three weeks and you don't know if you travel a lot.</v>

2822
01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Travel and licking your hand and touching things everywhere.</v>

2823
01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:09.330
<v Speaker 1>High five and people.</v>

2824
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2825
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.701
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

2826
01:18:11.701 --> 01:18:13.740
<v Speaker 1>You could spread that shit for sure.</v>

2827
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 7>Coughing on a subway,</v>

2828
01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:17.420
<v Speaker 7>like there's so many small,</v>

2829
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.280
<v Speaker 7>you think about it,</v>

2830
01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 7>it's on their hand and gives you a hand job.</v>

2831
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.823
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2832
01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:23.480
<v Speaker 7>That's how you got Ebola.</v>

2833
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:23.781
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

2834
01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 7>God damn,</v>

2835
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:26.420
<v Speaker 7>really the hottest shit.</v>

2836
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 7>Her eyes were really red.</v>

2837
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 7>She was probably just high,</v>

2838
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 7>but now I feel like temperature,</v>

2839
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.541
<v Speaker 7>she was so hot.</v>

2840
01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:36.620
<v Speaker 7>She gave me a temperature.</v>

2841
01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 7>I think she gave me something and I just got to planned parenthood.</v>

2842
01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:40.244
<v Speaker 7>They'll figure it.</v>

2843
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.741
<v Speaker 7>Planned parenthood.</v>

2844
01:18:41.741 --> 01:18:43.160
<v Speaker 7>So what do I have for Ebola?</v>

2845
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 7>And you be getting a and jobs from African Jag,</v>

2848
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 7>we need you to leave immediately.</v>

2849

<v Speaker 7>That's what you have.</v>

2850
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2851
01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.210

2852
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.670

2853
01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:58.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2858
01:19:05.411 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>patient to arrive in the u us soil was wheeled into an Atlanta hospital Tuesday</v>

2859
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:11.680
<v Speaker 1>by workers in biohazard suits.</v>

2866
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.710
<v Speaker 7>There was somebody that they had to a video where they showed him this like news</v>

2867
01:19:27.711 --> 01:19:31.640
<v Speaker 7>guy that was hiding in a Bush taking video or photos of this and he wasn't</v>

2868
01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:32.474
<v Speaker 7>wearing a suit though.</v>

2869
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 7>And it was just like,</v>

2872
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:37.670
<v Speaker 7>This is how it happens.</v>

2873
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 7>This is dumb.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2875
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:44.430

01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to do my job,</v>

2880
01:19:50.981 --> 01:19:51.281

2883
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:56.740

2884
01:19:57.850 --> 01:20:00.610
<v Speaker 1>that Gurney and pushing it in this space suits.</v>

2890
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's like 90% though if it,</v>

2891
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 3>if it happened in developed nations with like hospitals and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

2893

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:26.610
<v Speaker 3>start a fire and like chant to the gods and like hope that it goes away.</v>

2900
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.240
<v Speaker 3>More than 1400 Ebola cases have been confirmed in the worst known outbreak of</v>

2901
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:35.550

2905
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:48.950
<v Speaker 3>experimental drug or anything else about the infections ultimately leads to an a</v>

2906
01:20:48.951 --> 01:20:49.221
<v Speaker 3>bowl,</v>

2907

<v Speaker 3>I mean that's um,</v>

2993
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2994
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing like you think like if someone caught the Zombie disease and</v>

2995
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:13.951
<v Speaker 1>they knew they had the Zama disease but they knew that it didn't show up for a</v>

2996
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.111
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks,</v>

2997
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 1>but they get transmitted to people,</v>

2998
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:17.650
<v Speaker 1>would they still fuck I say they would.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3000
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.943
<v Speaker 1>they probably would</v>

3001
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.860
<v Speaker 7>be on my side.</v>

3002
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:20.690
<v Speaker 7>I want you to be honest.</v>

3003
01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:22.770
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to be the only one with a Zombie disease.</v>

3004
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>A dude was drinking or seedy hotel room when he ordered up a stripper and he</v>

3005
01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>knew he had the Zombie disease.</v>

3006
01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I could totally see the</v>

3007
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:33.160
<v Speaker 1>zombies eaves fucking spread.</v>

3008
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.210
<v Speaker 1>That's all you'd have to do,</v>

3009
01:23:34.211 --> 01:23:34.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3010
01:23:34.391 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3011
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.440
<v Speaker 7>They find a way to rationalize.</v>

3012
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:36.731
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3013
01:23:36.731 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 7>everyone's going to get it anyway.</v>

3014
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3015
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 7>And she asked me if I had chlamydia or gonorrhea.</v>

3016
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.910
<v Speaker 7>I said I didn't lie.</v>

3017
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.361
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

3018
01:23:43.361 --> 01:23:44.194
<v Speaker 7>I didn't have that.</v>

3019
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Have,</v>

3020
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.771
<v Speaker 1>can you get a broad?</v>

3021
01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Speaker 1>The sooner you accept that,</v>

3022
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3023
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.001

3025
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.261
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:23:51.261 --> 01:23:52.094
<v Speaker 7>No one ever asked,</v>

3027
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:53.600
<v Speaker 7>you don't have this Zombie disease.</v>

3028
01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:54.140
<v Speaker 7>Do,</v>

3029
01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:55.840
<v Speaker 7>what are you even talking about?</v>

3030
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:56.810
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

3031
01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.340
<v Speaker 7>So what disease are you fucking see?</v>

3032
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:00.203
<v Speaker 7>Fucking news.</v>

3033
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 7>Why would I have come on.</v>

3034
01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3035
01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:05.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3036
01:24:05.551 --> 01:24:07.020
<v Speaker 1>There could be something dark man.</v>

3037
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.990
<v Speaker 1>There could be some really crazy AVN.</v>

3038
01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Swine monkey flew the comes along,</v>

3039
01:24:12.931 --> 01:24:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but they just don't see common.</v>

3040
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.833
<v Speaker 1>Especially these,</v>

3041
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:17.610
<v Speaker 1>these hammer Rogerick ones.</v>

3042
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3043
01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.560
<v Speaker 1>those are terrified.</v>

3044
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3045
01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.130
<v Speaker 7>We should take these two people that they flew to Atlanta and just like drop</v>

3046
01:24:23.131 --> 01:24:26.730
<v Speaker 7>them off in North Korea and you just watch them walk around and you need to</v>

3047
01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:27.480
<v Speaker 7>study them.</v>

3048
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Find out whether or not the drugs work on them.</v>

3049
01:24:29.171 --> 01:24:30.004
<v Speaker 1>Dummy.</v>

3050
01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like find out like how to fix these people.</v>

3051
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Like when they put a lot of money into these things,</v>

3052
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:37.840
<v Speaker 1>like these kinds of projects,</v>

3053
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 1>like they have a new drugs,</v>

3054
01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:41.980
<v Speaker 1>the trying to test if it works,</v>

3055
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that they can make from it is giant.</v>

3056
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So they're probably working really hard on developing some sort of a cure.</v>

3057
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:50.780
<v Speaker 1>And if they they,</v>

3058
01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 1>they had enough hope in it.</v>

3059
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They injected people with,</v>

3060
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a good sign.</v>

3061
01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:54.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3062
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:56.320
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's going to be effective,</v>

3063
01:24:56.321 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 1>but it means they probably have done a lot of work with it already and they're</v>

3064
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure it does something good.</v>

3065
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:02.770
<v Speaker 1>They're not just taking wild guesses.</v>

3066
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's just inject him with the first thing that comes to mind.</v>

3067
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco.</v>

3068
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3069
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

3070
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.791
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

3071
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:07.624
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco,</v>

3072
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you know there,</v>

3073
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 1>there's must be some sort of a reason drugmakers stock falls after big pop.</v>

3074
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:16.463
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>

3075
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Why is it knowing ball vaccine,</v>

3076
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:21.470
<v Speaker 1>there is no cure for Ebola.</v>

3077
01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Do this is the beginning of Gone Gundam horror movie.</v>

3078
01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.650
<v Speaker 7>Is it people that have it don't have credit cards?</v>

3079
01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.120
<v Speaker 7>Like why would create a vaccine or a or a drug for people I like,</v>

3080
01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 7>we can pay you in goats.</v>

3081
01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.620
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

3082
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.120
<v Speaker 7>Here's this an Adobe hut.</v>

3083
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if we found out,</v>

3084
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.460
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure someone will suggest it's black helicopters,</v>

3085
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:46.100
<v Speaker 1>but someone will suggest that the reason why this Ebola outbreak has happened</v>

3086
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:49.960
<v Speaker 1>was because someone poisoned a bunch of people with a bola.</v>

3087
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown,</v>

3088
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>they injected a bola in the drinking water of this tribe so that they could</v>

3089
01:25:55.581 --> 01:25:56.120
<v Speaker 1>spread,</v>

3090
01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the aid workers would bring it back home with them</v>

3091
01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and then next thing you know this pharmaceutical drug companies making of</v>

3092
01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:04.660
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

3093
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3094
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3095
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to suggest that,</v>

3096
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:09.970
<v Speaker 1>but it could just be a bola motherfucker.</v>

3097
01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3098
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3099
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:11.771
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

3100
01:26:11.771 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>It could just be nature.</v>

3101
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 1>People escaped.</v>

3102
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They weren't supposed to.</v>

3103
01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 1>They quarantine people.</v>

3104
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>People got out.</v>

3105
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It spread.</v>

3106
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people die.</v>

3107
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 1>They could just be that too and it's most likely just that,</v>

3108
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's scary.</v>

3109
01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's scary as fuck.</v>

3110
01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you how easy it is for that shit to actually spread.</v>

3111
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Like everything doesn't have to be a conspiracy to be totally terrifying.</v>

3112
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Just a disease like this is fucking totally terrifying.</v>

3113
01:26:35.511 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be manufactured by the government like everybody has this</v>

3114
01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:39.051
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

3115
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>When one of these things happens,</v>

3116
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:41.980
<v Speaker 1>like one of the first things that you start reading about,</v>

3117
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like these government instituted programs with a design viruses that could</v>

3118
01:26:49.461 --> 01:26:53.120
<v Speaker 1>not be fought off dark smokey room,</v>

3119
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.250
<v Speaker 1>hello world population.</v>

3120
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 1>They want to lower the world population.</v>

3121
01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 1>To 500,000 worldwide.</v>

3122
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.470
<v Speaker 1>How do you think they're going to do that?</v>

3123
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3124
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3125
01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3126
01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3127
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:03.621
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3128
01:27:03.621 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but why to pocket billions of dollars.</v>

3129
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.970
<v Speaker 1>They will own everything.</v>

3130
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.610
<v Speaker 1>500,000 hookers and them</v>

3131
01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:13.323
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

3132
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That's been 500,000 people.</v>

3133
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:16.634
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lot.</v>

3134
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.691
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>

3135
01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:17.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3136
01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.720
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what the Georgia Guidestones doesn't that say something like that?</v>

3137
01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.180
<v Speaker 1>So I was like 500 million worldwide,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3139

<v Speaker 1>the Georgia Guidestones.</v>

3140
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.323
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

3141
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:31.420
<v Speaker 1>the Georgia Guidestones are these really tall pieces of stone that were carved</v>

3142
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:37.181
<v Speaker 1>in several different languages with guides for how to run a civilization.</v>

3143
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3144

3149
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:47.390
<v Speaker 1>The Georgia Guidestones like the guy who made him,</v>

3150
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure who that is,</v>

3151
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

3152

<v Speaker 1>how to manage a civilization.</v>

3157
01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

3158
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:01.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3159
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 1>they're not perfect,</v>

3160
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but they're kind of interesting.</v>

3161
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3162
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>here maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.</v>

3163
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 1>That's one to guide reproduction wisely.</v>

3164
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Improving fitness and diversity guide reproduction.</v>

3165
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.163
<v Speaker 1>Meaning,</v>

3166
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that's like engine engineering,</v>

3167
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.890
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>

3168
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a eugenics.</v>

3169
01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:27.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3170
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is like,</v>

3171
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you could say that this is some sort of an evil plot and it may be,</v>

3172
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but it also might be that they're just trying to look at it in what you would</v>

3173
01:28:35.421 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 1>consider it cold and calculated manner.</v>

3174
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:41.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you looked at it in Nicole and calculating manner,</v>

3175
01:28:41.301 --> 01:28:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you that anybody should do this,</v>

3176
01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:44.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you did,</v>

3177
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you would want to take the smartest females and breed them with the smartest</v>

3178
01:28:49.371 --> 01:28:51.770
<v Speaker 1>males and the ones who had the most good habits,</v>

3179
01:28:51.771 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the months who their most fit.</v>

3180
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:57.350
<v Speaker 1>You would want them to be the ones that would be raising children more often.</v>

3181
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3182
01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just like what you would do if you were raising dogs.</v>

3183
01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:02.150
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting one.</v>

3184
01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3185
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:04.160

<v Speaker 2>So he spray painted it.</v>

3188
01:29:08.331 --> 01:29:09.290
<v Speaker 2>That's so rude.</v>

3189
01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:10.930
<v Speaker 1>What else does it say here?</v>

3190
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:11.350

01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 3>this really complicated screen,</v>

3446
01:36:25.521 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 3>high definition touch screen,</v>

3447
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:28.250
<v Speaker 3>super accurate,</v>

3448
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 3>but you're still like doing this thing with your fucking,</v>

3449
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:32.390
<v Speaker 3>you're putting your mark.</v>

3450
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:34.790
<v Speaker 3>That's how you prove it's you.</v>

3451
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:36.230
<v Speaker 3>That's so goofy,</v>

3452
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:37.210
<v Speaker 3>goofy.</v>

3453
01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird that that's still the way we do it and it doesn't even matter</v>

3454
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:41.511
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3455
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:42.321
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't,</v>

3456
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:43.820
<v Speaker 3>there's no need to go through that.</v>

3457
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I did once.</v>

3458
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I was cause I was looking at one of these signs and things.</v>

3459
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm like this no way it matters.</v>

3460
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:54.370
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote in the signature box matter stolen card and I hit submit and I</v>

3461
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:56.374
<v Speaker 3>totally,</v>

3462
01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:57.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3463
01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.420
<v Speaker 3>it's just they want to get a record of you making a mark on that paper.</v>

3464
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>You're making a mark on that screen.</v>

3465
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:05.630
<v Speaker 3>What do you think will happen?</v>

3466
01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Because there's,</v>

3467
01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 3>they're going to stop teaching cursive in school and they're already starting to</v>

3468
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

3469
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.500
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen with signatures?</v>

3470
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:14.540
<v Speaker 3>That's good question.</v>

3471
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:16.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question.</v>

3472
01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:16.281
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3473
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:16.851
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to,</v>

3474
01:37:16.851 --> 01:37:18.740
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to sign things?</v>

3475
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Like if you never learn cursive,</v>

3476
01:37:22.101 --> 01:37:24.050
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to all have like codes.</v>

3477
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the idea of signing things is ridiculous and isn't it kind of</v>

3478
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:28.490
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous?</v>

3479
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 3>The idea of signing things like you shed</v>

3480
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're bound to an agreement,</v>

3481
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.160
<v Speaker 3>these wavy lines that you put on paper.</v>

3482
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 3>There's certain things that I think like business dealings,</v>

3483
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 3>like say if you and I decided to build a house together,</v>

3484
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 3>like nick and Joe go into construction business and we decided to build and we</v>

3485
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:54.980
<v Speaker 3>have a business and the businesses 50 50 and you,</v>

3486
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 3>we pay for the same amount for this and that and we get the same amount of</v>

3487
01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 3>profit and you got that all worked out.</v>

3488
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 3>That kind of makes sense to do that.</v>

3489
01:38:02.701 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of things that you signed for like cable agreements,</v>

3490
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:08.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3491
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:12.390
<v Speaker 3>or cell phone contracts or there's literally entanglements,</v>

3492
01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 3>business entanglements.</v>

3493
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:16.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a contract to get a cell phone.</v>

3494
01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Have I have to have a contract like what is this?</v>

3495
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:20.190
<v Speaker 3>When I'm,</v>

3496
01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 3>what am I agreeing to?</v>

3497
01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm agreeing to what is,</v>

3498
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:23.520
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

3499
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:25.000
<v Speaker 7>There's a whole documentary,</v>

3500
01:38:25.001 --> 01:38:30.001
<v Speaker 7>I watched a Netflix about terms and conditions and all the things that you sign</v>

3501
01:38:30.761 --> 01:38:32.120
<v Speaker 7>away the second you.</v>

3502
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3503
01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.270
<v Speaker 7>Who fucking reads that shit?</v>

3504
01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:34.811
<v Speaker 7>Nobody.</v>

3505
01:38:34.811 --> 01:38:38.620
<v Speaker 7>And that's why they get away with putting all kinds of insane shit.</v>

3506
01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:39.970
<v Speaker 7>And what's the documentary called?</v>

3507
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 7>It's called like we're fucked or</v>

3508
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:45.070
<v Speaker 7>really terrible.</v>

3509
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.860
<v Speaker 7>I think it's called like terms and conditions,</v>

3510
01:38:47.861 --> 01:38:48.431
<v Speaker 7>terms and sending.</v>

3511
01:38:48.431 --> 01:38:48.731
<v Speaker 7>It's on,</v>

3512
01:38:48.731 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 7>it's on Netflix and it's,</v>

3513
01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:54.160
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty interesting that they go through all the different companies and</v>

3514
01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:54.670
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3515
01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:55.503
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3516
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:56.380
<v Speaker 7>which ones like,</v>

3517
01:38:56.381 --> 01:39:00.490
<v Speaker 7>well we'll sell your personal information because you've agreed that the second</v>

3518
01:39:00.491 --> 01:39:05.170
<v Speaker 7>you hit click yes on iTunes or like you agreed to apples the second you turn on</v>

3519
01:39:05.171 --> 01:39:06.460
<v Speaker 7>your iPhone or something like that,</v>

3520
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:09.130
<v Speaker 7>they can store your information,</v>

3521
01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.620
<v Speaker 7>they can sell it if the government needs it.</v>

3522
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:13.120
<v Speaker 7>They used to be like,</v>

3523
01:39:13.121 --> 01:39:14.710
<v Speaker 7>we will not give out your information.</v>

3524
01:39:14.711 --> 01:39:16.780
<v Speaker 7>And then they've changed the clause to like,</v>

3525
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:17.320
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3526
01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.560
<v Speaker 7>unless like it,</v>

3527
01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:19.420
<v Speaker 7>it'll be words like,</v>

3528
01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:24.630
<v Speaker 7>unless certain things come up the fuck does that mean he just be anything less</v>

3529
01:39:25.241 --> 01:39:26.074
<v Speaker 7>certain things.</v>

3530
01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:30.310
<v Speaker 7>They're so vague about it unless like shit goes down,</v>

3531
01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:30.611
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

3532
01:39:30.611 --> 01:39:31.600
<v Speaker 7>you can't say that.</v>

3533
01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.260
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>

3534
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:32.740
<v Speaker 7>what is that?</v>

3535
01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.090
<v Speaker 7>That South Park Episode,</v>

3536
01:39:34.091 --> 01:39:37.930
<v Speaker 7>Human Sin and pad where it's all about Apple's terminus and conditions ends up</v>

3537
01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:41.050
<v Speaker 7>having like you signed this guy's ass</v>

3538
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.460
<v Speaker 7>south park's the best.</v>

3539
01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.140
<v Speaker 7>That's so great.</v>

3540
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3541
01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:51.860
<v Speaker 3>and nobody reads it.</v>

3542
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:52.883
<v Speaker 3>I would like,</v>

3543
01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:56.000
<v Speaker 3>I would love to know what the actual numbers of people who read the terms and</v>

3544
01:39:56.001 --> 01:39:57.350
<v Speaker 3>conditions before they click on it.</v>

3545
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:01.220
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be half a percent if that.</v>

3546
01:40:01.221 --> 01:40:02.054
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3547
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:03.740
<v Speaker 3>That means so much.</v>

3548
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:08.660
<v Speaker 3>That means half a percent is one person out of 200 right?</v>

3549
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:09.583
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what it means?</v>

3550
01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3551
01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3552
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:11.241
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3553
01:40:11.241 --> 01:40:11.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3554
01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3555
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3556
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3557
01:40:12.771 --> 01:40:17.200
<v Speaker 3>1% would be one out of 100 so half a percent is 1% of 200 does that make sense?</v>

3558
01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:18.930
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>

3559
01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that.</v>

3560
01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Does he think it's even less?</v>

3561
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3562
01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably</v>

3563
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:27.500
<v Speaker 3>not even,</v>

3564
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:32.500
<v Speaker 3>not 1% but like one 10th of 1% I bet it's one out of a thousand that's what I</v>

3565
01:40:33.651 --> 01:40:34.484
<v Speaker 3>bet.</v>

3566
01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:34.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3567
01:40:34.911 --> 01:40:35.840
<v Speaker 3>that makes more sense.</v>

3568
01:40:36.650 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 3>One out of a thousand actually reads the whole thing and he goes,</v>

3569
01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:40.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3570
01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I want to click on this.</v>

3571
01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:42.463
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

3572
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3573
01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:46.840
<v Speaker 3>it sounds reading glasses as fucking God damn liberal president we have here and</v>

3574
01:40:46.841 --> 01:40:48.310
<v Speaker 3>trying to calm me and asmark countries.</v>

3575
01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3576
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3577
01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.030
<v Speaker 3>That guy will read it</v>

3578
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 7>and they tell that</v>

3579
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 7>they tell you in</v>

3580
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.270
<v Speaker 2>the documentary if you spent all the time reading every time like a new terms</v>

3581
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:01.730
<v Speaker 2>and conditions comes up for all the different things that make you sign when it</v>

3582
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it would take like years of your life you have to take like days off</v>

3583
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 2>of work to be like dude I just sign up for Netflix,</v>

3584
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Spotify and I got a new iPhone.</v>

3585
01:41:10.271 --> 01:41:14.770
<v Speaker 2>So like I can't come into work today because I have to read like 860 pages of</v>

3586
01:41:14.771 --> 01:41:15.670
<v Speaker 2>legal jargon.</v>

3587
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:16.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3588
01:41:16.441 --> 01:41:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It should be at a certain point in time.</v>

3589
01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It should be that your method of delivery is so woefully ineffective that it's</v>

3590
01:41:21.871 --> 01:41:22.620
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

3591
01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Like a terms and conditions on that scale.</v>

3592
01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:29.511
<v Speaker 1>If I could prove that my theory was correct and then it's like one half of 1% or</v>

3593
01:41:29.701 --> 01:41:33.180
<v Speaker 1>one 10th of 1% rather that that actually read that thing,</v>

3594
01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.313
<v Speaker 1>they'll should be illegal.</v>

3595
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3596
01:41:34.670 --> 01:41:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're making people sign things and they're just not reading,</v>

3597
01:41:36.811 --> 01:41:37.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3598
01:41:37.111 --> 01:41:37.921
<v Speaker 2>they're not reading it.</v>

3599
01:41:37.921 --> 01:41:38.754
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3600
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:39.720
<v Speaker 2>You're like misleading.</v>

3601
01:41:39.721 --> 01:41:41.730
<v Speaker 2>You're intentionally making it more difficult.</v>

3602
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:46.940
<v Speaker 1>They make everything so rock solid in their favor and even things that like just</v>

3603
01:41:47.581 --> 01:41:48.810
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be that way.</v>

3604
01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:54.140
<v Speaker 1>There's certain agreements like when you find out that anytime you cancel,</v>

3605
01:41:55.051 --> 01:41:55.884
<v Speaker 1>anytime you,</v>

3606
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3607
01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you want to change this,</v>

3608
01:41:57.541 --> 01:41:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you're subject to fees,</v>

3609
01:41:58.771 --> 01:42:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you're subject to that and you'll let you find out things about your</v>

3610
01:42:01.801 --> 01:42:02.431
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

3611
01:42:02.431 --> 01:42:03.120
<v Speaker 1>your history,</v>

3612
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.160
<v Speaker 1>they're selling your phone number or your email.</v>

3613
01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:09.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many things that happen to people when you sign those little</v>

3614
01:42:09.481 --> 01:42:10.314
<v Speaker 1>things away.</v>

3615
01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.810
<v Speaker 1>But we do it recklessly.</v>

3616
01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3617
01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever think about it.</v>

3618
01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.341
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had a,</v>

3619
01:42:16.341 --> 01:42:17.970
<v Speaker 1>an app that you click the yes.</v>

3620
01:42:17.971 --> 01:42:19.410
<v Speaker 1>On then it started making tweaks for you?</v>

3621
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3622
01:42:19.991 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 2>there's there,</v>

3623
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 2>especially on Android,</v>

3624
01:42:21.731 --> 01:42:26.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of sketchy things that like a year installing so they can also</v>

3625
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:27.440
<v Speaker 2>track you like any,</v>

3626
01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:27.670
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3627
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:29.410
<v Speaker 2>whoever made this app and track you.</v>

3628
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:30.130
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

3629
01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3630
01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy,</v>

3631
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3632
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.610
<v Speaker 1>he made some app,</v>

3633
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3634
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:39.490
<v Speaker 1>that tweeted for me something about like a how do a prize for an Ipad,</v>

3635
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3636
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

3637
01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:41.741
<v Speaker 1>and someone said,</v>

3638
01:42:41.741 --> 01:42:41.990
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3639
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you hawk an iPad.</v>

3640
01:42:43.031 --> 01:42:43.331
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3641
01:42:43.331 --> 01:42:43.880
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

3642
01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.681
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to my thing,</v>

3643
01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:44.891
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3644
01:42:44.891 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3645
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out where it was from this guy,</v>

3646
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess I had like retweeted something from a website.</v>

3647
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes when you retweet something,</v>

3648
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:59.350
<v Speaker 1>like if you go to a website and you click on it a story or something that you</v>

3649
01:42:59.351 --> 01:43:00.880
<v Speaker 1>think is interesting and you,</v>

3650
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:04.750
<v Speaker 1>there's like a tweet button but if you tweet it like sometimes you were agreeing</v>

3651
01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 1>to allow them to have access to your Twitter account or at least used to be that</v>

3652
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:09.450
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3653
01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:09.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3654
01:43:09.661 --> 01:43:10.441
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those websites,</v>

3655
01:43:10.441 --> 01:43:11.040
<v Speaker 2>that's how you,</v>

3656
01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.370
<v Speaker 2>they steal your credit or your a password asa because you go in and order to</v>

3657
01:43:14.371 --> 01:43:18.060
<v Speaker 2>complete like tweet this story and this is like you need to log in and what it's</v>

3658
01:43:18.061 --> 01:43:18.331
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

3659
01:43:18.331 --> 01:43:22.500
<v Speaker 2>it's actually stealing your password and logging you in at the same time.</v>

3660
01:43:22.501 --> 01:43:24.240
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like everything's going right.</v>

3661
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And then that's how a lot of people will get fished for there.</v>

3662
01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3663
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine,</v>

3664
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:31.323
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3665
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.390
<v Speaker 1>there's dude's somehow or another,</v>

3666
01:43:32.391 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it had like an APP installed on my Twitter.</v>

3667
01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3668
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know those,</v>

3669
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 1>those things that are attached to your Twitter,</v>

3670
01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:38.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3671
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 1>there's like Evernote and you can tweet with Evernote and there's a bunch of</v>

3672
01:43:40.841 --> 01:43:41.674
<v Speaker 1>different ones.</v>

3673
01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:43.970
<v Speaker 1>This guy had like this installed on my computer.</v>

3674
01:43:43.971 --> 01:43:44.171
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3675
01:43:44.171 --> 01:43:45.004
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3676
01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So I go to his website,</v>

3677
01:43:46.121 --> 01:43:46.781
<v Speaker 1>his website is like,</v>

3678
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:47.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3679
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you know it his Twitter page or like a hundred thousand fucking friends or</v>

3680
01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:52.581
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

3681
01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:53.414
<v Speaker 1>Followers.</v>

3682
01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Like how's he doing that?</v>

3683
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.590

3684
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:59.700
<v Speaker 1>You automatically add them?</v>

3685
01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>

3686
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3687
01:44:00.670 --> 01:44:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I do a search to find out what like what kind of traffic is websites getting</v>

3688
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous traffic cause this is all this weasel work going on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3691
01:44:11.631 --> 01:44:12.370
<v Speaker 1>clicking on things,</v>

3692

<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out that that's legal.</v>

3697
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:20.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3702

<v Speaker 7>Do I need that?</v>

3707
01:44:36.181 --> 01:44:38.010
<v Speaker 7>Because I'm not going to read the terms and conditions.</v>

3708
01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I had him on my podcast and we had a very contentious discussion I sad to hear.</v>

3716
01:44:56.710 --> 01:44:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And He um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>

3718
01:45:00.311 --> 01:45:01.144
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3719
01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:02.740
<v Speaker 1>an issue with,</v>

3720
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:04.150
<v Speaker 1>believe it was Amazon,</v>

3721

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:45:06.450 --> 01:45:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And he had created some sort of an APP.</v>

3725
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And if you use the APP it,</v>

3726
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.240
<v Speaker 1>it puts a cookie on your,</v>

3727
01:45:13.241 --> 01:45:14.074
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3728
01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:15.180
<v Speaker 1>on your,</v>

3729
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:15.791
<v Speaker 1>on your computer.</v>

3730
01:45:15.791 --> 01:45:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you use it,</v>

3731
01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.550
<v Speaker 1>it puts a cookie on your computer.</v>

3732
01:45:18.551 --> 01:45:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And then anytime you go to Ebay and make a purchase or do business,</v>

3733
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.340
<v Speaker 1>he would get like a kickback.</v>

3734
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And the way he described the way described it is very different.</v>

3735
01:45:29.021 --> 01:45:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know who's right or who's wrong,</v>

3736
01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:35.610
<v Speaker 1>but what they're accusing him of is you plant something on,</v>

3737
01:45:35.801 --> 01:45:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you're like a plant,</v>

3738
01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:37.150
<v Speaker 1>a cookie.</v>

3739
01:45:37.150 --> 01:45:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And then even if you don't go to Ebay through his website,</v>

3740
01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it appears that you did.</v>

3741
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So they have like these ebay affiliates where say like if nick use of.com if I</v>

3742
01:45:46.301 --> 01:45:48.970
<v Speaker 1>went through that and then went to Ebay and purchase something,</v>

3743
01:45:49.090 --> 01:45:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you would get like a little tiny piece of the action.</v>

3744
01:45:51.071 --> 01:45:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And over time that counts.</v>

3745
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:53.380
<v Speaker 1>That counts for a lot.</v>

3746
01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And because these apps were popular account for a lot,</v>

3747
01:45:56.111 --> 01:45:57.010
<v Speaker 1>and he made a lot of money,</v>

3748
01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.330
<v Speaker 1>5 million.</v>

3749
01:45:58.540 --> 01:45:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3750
01:45:59.130 --> 01:45:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3751
01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.570
<v Speaker 1>He made $5 million off the APP and then they,</v>

3752
01:46:01.571 --> 01:46:02.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3753
01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they shut it down and arrested him.</v>

3754
01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And when we had them on the podcast,</v>

3755
01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I do not think he's a bad guy,</v>

3756
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but there's something wrong with the way he thinks.</v>

3757
01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And what would I say that I say that with all,</v>

3758
01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:17.590
<v Speaker 1>all respect and dignity,</v>

3759
01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3760
01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.670
<v Speaker 1>communicating about a fellow human being,</v>

3761
01:46:21.671 --> 01:46:22.750
<v Speaker 1>like I don't hate that guy.</v>

3762
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.771
<v Speaker 1>He's silly.</v>

3763
01:46:23.771 --> 01:46:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And he said a bunch of crazy shit about me.</v>

3764
01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3765
01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's,</v>

3766
01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something wrong with the way he thinks I'm thinking.</v>

3767
01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And I even communicated with him about that in private.</v>

3768
01:46:33.581 --> 01:46:37.000
<v Speaker 1>We had like a little email conversation and he actually asked me about</v>

3769
01:46:37.001 --> 01:46:41.320
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs and he's curious about the mind expanding aspects.</v>

3770
01:46:41.321 --> 01:46:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And we had a,</v>

3771
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:44.920
<v Speaker 1>we had a pretty intense conversation about it.</v>

3772
01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3773
01:46:46.090 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>

3774
01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3775
01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:48.701
<v Speaker 1>and I told him that,</v>

3776
01:46:48.701 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I said with due respect,</v>

3777
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something wrong with the way you think.</v>

3778
01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3779
01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

3780
01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's like a mental illness.</v>

3781
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:54.661
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

3782
01:46:54.661 --> 01:46:58.200
<v Speaker 1>his versions of reality and reality itself are so twisted.</v>

3783
01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a video that we watched of tower seven from September 11th</v>

3784
01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:08.391
<v Speaker 1>falling and he was trying to convince us that it doesn't collapse into its base.</v>

3785
01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to convince us that only three quarters of the tower,</v>

3786
01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 1>the three quarters of the tower is still standing.</v>

3787
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It was only the top quarter or whatever it was.</v>

3788
01:47:16.351 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>He had some weird numbers in his head and I'm like,</v>

3789
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about that that thing gives out and falls into a pile.</v>

3790
01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Like the reason why it's so high is because that's how much shit there is.</v>

3791
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:27.830
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing's gone.</v>

3792
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Like the building disintegrate.</v>

3793
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cartoon.</v>

3794
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll just vanishes.</v>

3795
01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3796
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it's all on top.</v>

3797
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3798
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:33.301
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3799
01:47:33.301 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's on for rent signs,</v>

3800
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:35.580
<v Speaker 1>stack of Shit.</v>

3801
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 1>The reason why the stack is so high is because there was a lot of shit above it.</v>

3802
01:47:38.551 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It felt like this is retarded like this,</v>

3803
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.400
<v Speaker 1>but he wouldn't let it go and what I was looking at him when he wouldn't let it</v>

3804
01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:44.551
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

3805
01:47:44.551 --> 01:47:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3806
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:44.971
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3807
01:47:44.971 --> 01:47:46.410
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong in there.</v>

3808
01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>

3809
01:47:47.370 --> 01:47:48.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a missing thing.</v>

3810
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And then when he started talking about his life,</v>

3811
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 1>it made way more sense because he was raised a very,</v>

3812
01:47:53.611 --> 01:47:55.770
<v Speaker 1>very conservative Mormon,</v>

3813
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 1>like his whole life.</v>

3814
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 1>He was very religious and he's,</v>

3815
01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:05.210
<v Speaker 1>he's developed his mind developed under this fundamentalist thinking that is</v>

3816
01:48:05.821 --> 01:48:07.470
<v Speaker 1>super damaging to people.</v>

3817
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds like an ignorant bigot and an anti religious thing for me to</v>

3818
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:12.660
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

3819
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But just listen to this for a second.</v>

3820
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that grew up Mormon and they to this day tell me that they're</v>

3821
01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:21.680
<v Speaker 1>really gullible.</v>

3822
01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They worry about it.</v>

3823
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:23.873
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

3824
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't know whether or not someone is trying to pull a fast one on them.</v>

3825
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:34.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't know whether or not like a yoga guru or a cult member could rope them</v>

3826
01:48:35.731 --> 01:48:38.850
<v Speaker 1>in and suck them into things by telling them that they found a seat.</v>

3827
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Like they have this weird need to believe irrational things.</v>

3828
01:48:41.911 --> 01:48:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is when this woman who tells me herself,</v>

3829
01:48:43.471 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 1>it disturbs her.</v>

3830
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:45.211
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3831
01:48:45.211 --> 01:48:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

3832
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but I have this weird like I'm,</v>

3833
01:48:48.951 --> 01:48:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm susceptible to trickery.</v>

3834
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:51.571
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3835
01:48:51.571 --> 01:48:52.261
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3836
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a weird admission and she was just talking.</v>

3837
01:48:54.941 --> 01:48:55.291
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

3838
01:48:55.291 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 1>as I've gotten older and she's not dumb,</v>

3839
01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:58.531
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

3840
01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.810
<v Speaker 1>as I've gotten older and I've talked to my other friends,</v>

3841
01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:01.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3842
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.940
<v Speaker 1>well what is it about me and she's like,</v>

3843
01:49:02.941 --> 01:49:07.941
<v Speaker 1>because all my life I thought that God had my back all my life.</v>

3844
01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought that God has everything covered in.</v>

3845
01:49:10.471 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going to be fine until over and over again.</v>

3846
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:13.441
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

3847
01:49:13.441 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Things would happen to her and she was forced to go wait,</v>

3848
01:49:15.241 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

3849
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:19.510
<v Speaker 1>And then she would see the ridiculous hypocrisy of the church.</v>

3850
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:23.010
<v Speaker 1>She looked into the religion deeper than got to be like your forties and is</v>

3851
01:49:23.011 --> 01:49:24.030
<v Speaker 1>looking at her life going,</v>

3852
01:49:24.031 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

3853
01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.930
<v Speaker 1>like what is this and why am I,</v>

3854
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.793
<v Speaker 1>why am I,</v>

3855
01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>that guy is like that.</v>

3856
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 1>He grew up super religious when you grew up super religious like that,</v>

3857
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't have open minded parents,</v>

3858
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:40.860
<v Speaker 1>like there's a way I think that you could grow up with a sense of spirituality</v>

3859
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 1>and still be very open minded and maybe scientifically inclined.</v>

3860
01:49:45.031 --> 01:49:47.000
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why this guy is like such a,</v>

3861
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>these like going after things like debunking things showing,</v>

3862
01:49:51.881 --> 01:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

3863
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.770
<v Speaker 1>this is all nonsense.</v>

3864
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3865
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I give you ever seen his video on fracking?</v>

3866
01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3867
01:49:58.450 --> 01:49:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3868
01:49:59.350 --> 01:50:04.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the perfect example of there's like a no nonsense voice that people use</v>

3869
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:06.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's like there's a tone.</v>

3870
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 1>This is like a very condescending way of communicating their ideas.</v>

3871
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the no nonsense guy.</v>

3872
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of things that are misunderstood about hydraulic fracturing,</v>

3873
01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:20.560
<v Speaker 1>otherwise known as fracking.</v>

3874
01:50:21.090 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen him pull that video up?</v>

3875
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause this was back in the day when I first saw it.</v>

3876
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:27.400
<v Speaker 1>What did you believe that fracking was?</v>

3877
01:50:27.401 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Real?</v>

3878
01:50:28.210 --> 01:50:28.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3879
01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3880
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:29.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm tracking,</v>

3881
01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3882
01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:30.803
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>

3883
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe they wouldn't though.</v>

3884
01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Fracking is totally real.</v>

3885
01:50:33.701 --> 01:50:35.110
<v Speaker 1>They make a lot of money off of fracking.</v>

3886
01:50:35.111 --> 01:50:35.944
<v Speaker 1>Son,</v>

3887
01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:36.731
<v Speaker 1>what did you,</v>

3888
01:50:36.731 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3889
01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 1>what were you talking about?</v>

3890
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 1>This little things in the cameras?</v>

3891
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of that things in the Cam.</v>

3892
01:50:43.001 --> 01:50:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember like the lines,</v>

3893
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.090
<v Speaker 1>oh you talking about like the,</v>

3894
01:50:46.150 --> 01:50:46.983
<v Speaker 1>the rods.</v>

3895
01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3896
01:50:48.431 --> 01:50:48.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3897
01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:49.750
<v Speaker 1>No that's totally different.</v>

3898
01:50:49.751 --> 01:50:50.584
<v Speaker 1>That guy's mad at me.</v>

3899
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 1>That rod guy,</v>

3900
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:53.043
<v Speaker 1>the right guy.</v>

3901
01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.390
<v Speaker 1>They've clowned him on that.</v>

3902
01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 1>A monster quest show.</v>

3903
01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:57.781
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

3904
01:50:57.781 --> 01:50:57.881
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3905
01:50:57.881 --> 01:50:59.330
<v Speaker 1>with the rods are there the,</v>

3906
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:04.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a visual artifact that comes when bugs fly across the screen,</v>

3907
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but bugs move really fast.</v>

3908
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have a super high speed camera,</v>

3909
01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't capture the bug.</v>

3910
01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.480
<v Speaker 1>So it elongates the shape of the bug because it's this little tiny thing moving</v>

3911
01:51:13.481 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 1>quickly and it looks like a translucent tube that's moving through the air and</v>

3912
01:51:17.831 --> 01:51:21.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just a video artifact of video cameras trying to capture high speed bugs.</v>

3913
01:51:21.710 --> 01:51:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And this guy made all these documentaries about this,</v>

3914
01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.210
<v Speaker 1>these things flying in the air man.</v>

3915
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And you could only see him on camera.</v>

3916
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:28.000
<v Speaker 1>They moved too fast with the human eye,</v>

3917
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't make any sense.</v>

3918
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I can see them on the camera,</v>

3919
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:31.833
<v Speaker 1>like the video,</v>

3920
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:33.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not too fast for the human eye.</v>

3921
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3922
01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3923
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing the video of it.</v>

3924
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:39.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is actually slower than the human eye can perceive you.</v>

3925
01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 1>The human eye sees shit.</v>

3926
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:41.141
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3927
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:41.381
<v Speaker 1>Like Hey,</v>

3928
01:51:41.381 --> 01:51:42.214
<v Speaker 1>what does that fucking him?</v>

3929
01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.073
<v Speaker 1>Some shit flying flat.</v>

3930
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 1>You would see it.</v>

3931
01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.460
<v Speaker 1>This is so stupid.</v>

3932
01:51:45.461 --> 01:51:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could see to the video,</v>

3933
01:51:46.511 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you would see it in real life.</v>

3934
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

3935
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.150
<v Speaker 1>And he tried to run with a conspiracy that he made documentary.</v>

3936
01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Me and Eddie Bravo got stoned.</v>

3937
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking watched it and were like,</v>

3938
01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.081
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3939
01:51:56.081 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3940
01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.700
<v Speaker 1>what do you think these rods are?</v>

3941
01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.170
<v Speaker 1>We're so high were so ridiculous.</v>

3942
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.680
<v Speaker 1>We're go,</v>

3943
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 1>we're using the arm man.</v>

3944
01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that you can't see them.</v>

3945
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:05.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3946
01:52:05.861 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even make any sense,</v>

3947
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:07.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3948
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>

3949
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 1>So you think they're everywhere.</v>

3950
01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:10.691
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>

3951
01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:11.590
<v Speaker 1>They're just moving so fast.</v>

3952
01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.424
<v Speaker 1>We can't see them.</v>

3953
01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:13.751
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3954
01:52:13.751 --> 01:52:14.561
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>

3955
01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should put up a new us.</v>

3956
01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 1>We should put up a net and try to catch him.</v>

3957
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3958
01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.341
<v Speaker 1>there's so fast.</v>

3959
01:52:18.341 --> 01:52:18.971
<v Speaker 1>They see the net,</v>

3960
01:52:18.971 --> 01:52:19.804
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>

3961
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.471
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

3962
01:52:20.471 --> 01:52:20.831
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3963
01:52:20.831 --> 01:52:21.664
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3964
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:22.331
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

3965
01:52:22.331 --> 01:52:24.340
<v Speaker 1>like they would slam into planes and shit.</v>

3966
01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:25.630
<v Speaker 1>They get killing them off of planes.</v>

3967
01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:26.141
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

3968
01:52:26.141 --> 01:52:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Listen to Brian talk about hydraulic fracturing.</v>

3969
01:52:29.690 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 10>Then sand is mixed with the water and gets distributed throughout the cracks to</v>

3970
01:52:34.011 --> 01:52:34.850
<v Speaker 10>prop them open.</v>

3971
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:39.650
<v Speaker 10>The water is then pumped back out and now the gas can freely float to the</v>

3972
01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.493
<v Speaker 10>borehole.</v>

3973
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.500
<v Speaker 10>The controversy comes mainly from the fact that about one half of one of the</v>

3974
01:52:45.501 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 10>fluid</v>

3975
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.620
<v Speaker 1>consists of lubricants and surfactants.</v>

3976
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>We needed to get the controversy comes to the fact that people can't drink their</v>

3977
01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:53.961
<v Speaker 1>water anymore.</v>

3978
01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:54.794
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3979
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:57.310
<v Speaker 1>This hydraulic fracturing like this,</v>

3980
01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those things that you bring up in a conversation on podcasts and</v>

3981
01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:02.900
<v Speaker 1>people go fucking bananas.</v>

3982
01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a global warming type issue.</v>

3983
01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3984
01:53:05.110 --> 01:53:05.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3985
01:53:05.201 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3986
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:06.710
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>

3987
01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.470
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in global warming or if you don't believe in global warming,</v>

3988
01:53:09.471 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna piss somebody off and then getting get heated tweets about it.</v>

3989
01:53:12.651 --> 01:53:14.720
<v Speaker 1>People get fucking furious because it's an,</v>

3990
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an ideology argument and people that abortion support,</v>

3991
01:53:20.690 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3992
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 1>People that support hydraulic fracturing support business.</v>

3993
01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3994
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand nick use if you fucking Hippie,</v>

3995
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you understand business.</v>

3996
01:53:28.670 --> 01:53:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3997
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 1>The way business gets done is it's cheaper to get that oil out than it is to</v>

3998
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:36.620
<v Speaker 1>rely on foreign oil and endanger Americans.</v>

3999
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Like it's that sort of attitude.</v>

4000
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4001
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the people that are like environmentally conscious.</v>

4002
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:41.511
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

4003
01:53:41.511 --> 01:53:41.601
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4004
01:53:41.601 --> 01:53:41.721
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4005
01:53:41.721 --> 01:53:41.931
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4006
01:53:41.931 --> 01:53:42.081
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4007
01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:42.291
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

4008
01:53:42.291 --> 01:53:43.124
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>

4009
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Like how much water is getting polluted?</v>

4010
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Like how many wells are there?</v>

4011
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:47.640
<v Speaker 1>There's millions who,</v>

4012
01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

4013
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

4014
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you guys have a million fracking wells?</v>

4015
01:53:50.691 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a million and it's causing earthquakes too.</v>

4016
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4017
01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:53.901
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4018
01:53:53.901 --> 01:53:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4019
01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:54.381
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4020
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:54.621
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4021
01:53:54.621 --> 01:53:54.861
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4022
01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:55.071
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

4023
01:53:55.071 --> 01:53:55.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

4024
01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:55.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4025
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:56.990
<v Speaker 1>what we need now,</v>

4026
01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not hippies.</v>

4027
01:53:58.101 --> 01:54:00.080
<v Speaker 1>What we need now now oil,</v>

4028
01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 1>patriotism,</v>

4029
01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:03.523
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

4030
01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pro or con fracking,</v>

4031
01:54:05.841 --> 01:54:06.560
<v Speaker 1>these gentlemen.</v>

4032
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not opposed to putting a fence around a certain area of like South Dakota</v>

4033
01:54:10.941 --> 01:54:15.350
<v Speaker 1>where nobody goes and fracking the shit out of that bitch and not having to go</v>

4034
01:54:15.351 --> 01:54:17.030
<v Speaker 1>to war for fall foreign oil.</v>

4035
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally opposed to that.</v>

4036
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:21.860
<v Speaker 1>My problem is I don't think it's controlled.</v>

4037
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4038
01:54:22.450 --> 01:54:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and when you talk about like,</v>

4039
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.930
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4040
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:26.120
<v Speaker 1>let's guess how many fracking wells are there?</v>

4041
01:54:26.121 --> 01:54:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's take it.</v>

4042
01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Take a wild guess.</v>

4043
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:30.260
<v Speaker 1>They've been fracking in Ohio lately and now we have all these earthquakes.</v>

4044
01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4045
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Proven.</v>

4046
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Proven.</v>

4047
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That's so scary.</v>

4048
01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:34.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4049
01:54:34.911 --> 01:54:38.660
<v Speaker 1>How many fracking wells in the u s a thousand.</v>

4050
01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:39.740
<v Speaker 1>That's so cute.</v>

4051
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:41.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a really low number.</v>

4052
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:41.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4053
01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:43.000
<v Speaker 1>that's so close.</v>

4054
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Low to look.</v>

4055
01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You're handsome bastard,</v>

4056
01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:47.001
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

4057
01:54:47.001 --> 01:54:47.331
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4058
01:54:47.331 --> 01:54:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's so low.</v>

4059
01:54:48.411 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

4060
01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's more than a billion,</v>

4061
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:51.943
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

4062
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4063
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.153
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

4064
01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I would say yeah,</v>

4065
01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>5,000 to 10,000 that's it.</v>

4066
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.111
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4067
01:55:00.111 --> 01:55:03.950
<v Speaker 1>You guys say in the thousands would you say I said I said around a thousand you</v>

4068
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 1>said five thousand ten thousand I said a million.</v>

4069
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:08.623
<v Speaker 1>I bet you guys were right.</v>

4070
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4071
01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.860
<v Speaker 1>2013 to two two,</v>

4072
01:55:12.861 --> 01:55:13.041
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

4073
01:55:13.041 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

4074
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:14.983
<v Speaker 1>What's the numbers?</v>

4075
01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:20.040
<v Speaker 1>So numbers over 1.1 million active oil and gas wells in the u s whoa.</v>

4076
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4077
01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:23.511
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4078
01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:24.500
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are fractured?</v>

4079
01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Many people ask us how many wells have been hydraulically fracture?</v>

4080
01:55:29.401 --> 01:55:30.234
<v Speaker 1>The United States?</v>

4081
01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.850
<v Speaker 1>It's an excellent question,</v>

4082
01:55:31.851 --> 01:55:33.470
<v Speaker 1>but not one that's easily answered.</v>

4083
01:55:33.471 --> 01:55:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Most states don't release the data on well stimulation activities.</v>

4084
01:55:39.021 --> 01:55:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

4085
01:55:39.471 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 1>since the data are released by state regulatory agencies,</v>

4086
01:55:42.891 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>it is necessary to obtain data from each state that has oil and gas data to even</v>

4087
01:55:47.881 --> 01:55:49.170
<v Speaker 1>begin the conversation.</v>

4088
01:55:49.171 --> 01:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>We finally had a chance to complete the task and have able to be,</v>

4089
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4090
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:56.340
<v Speaker 1>able to aggregate the following totals.</v>

4091
01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:56.731
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4092
01:55:56.731 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty nuts,</v>

4093
01:55:57.571 --> 01:55:58.404
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4094
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking Wellsboro.</v>

4095
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:02.310
<v Speaker 1>There's over a million.</v>

4096
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4097
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.453
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

4098
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

4099
01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:06.810
<v Speaker 1>that's scary,</v>

4100
01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:08.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4101
01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:13.140
<v Speaker 1>How is that a better idea than investing in like solar paneling and like</v>

4102
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>alternate sources?</v>

4103
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4104
01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different kinds of wells though.</v>

4105
01:56:17.251 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So let me just clarify that.</v>

4106
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:20.731
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4107
01:56:20.731 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4108
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:22.380
<v Speaker 1>directional.</v>

4109
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different types,</v>

4110
01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:24.121
<v Speaker 1>directional,</v>

4111
01:56:24.121 --> 01:56:24.954
<v Speaker 1>horizontal,</v>

4112
01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 1>either direction or horizontal.</v>

4113
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:27.683
<v Speaker 1>Vertical,</v>

4114
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.220
<v Speaker 1>hydraulically fractured,</v>

4115
01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:30.240
<v Speaker 1>not fractured,</v>

4116
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:33.030
<v Speaker 1>unknown or shale formation.</v>

4117
01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So all of these,</v>

4118
01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:36.810
<v Speaker 1>all of these,</v>

4119
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a million,</v>

4120
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:40.830
<v Speaker 1>but it says hydraulically fractured.</v>

4121
01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It says one 30.</v>

4122
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 1>But does that mean is only 130 fracking wells as east state releases data</v>

4123
01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:48.811
<v Speaker 1>differently?</v>

4124
01:56:48.811 --> 01:56:52.680
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't always possible to get consistent data on fracking wells.</v>

4125
01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 1>These wells are known to be hydraulically flat fractured,</v>

4126
01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:58.620
<v Speaker 1>but the slant of the well is unknown.</v>

4127
01:56:59.070 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4128
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:00.383
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

4129
01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4130
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.140
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of different ways that they get the wall,</v>

4131
01:57:04.170 --> 01:57:04.921
<v Speaker 1>the water out,</v>

4132
01:57:04.921 --> 01:57:07.020
<v Speaker 1>or get the oil out.</v>

4133
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating shit,</v>

4134
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:09.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4135
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 1>They go down,</v>

4136
01:57:10.321 --> 01:57:11.430
<v Speaker 1>then they take turns.</v>

4137
01:57:11.850 --> 01:57:12.211
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4138
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll go down and then take left turns or they'll go like horizontally or the</v>

4139
01:57:15.991 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 1>good and angle into the earth,</v>

4140
01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:18.390
<v Speaker 1>depending on where the,</v>

4141
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:20.580
<v Speaker 1>where the rock is and where the oil is.</v>

4142
01:57:20.581 --> 01:57:21.630
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to suck out.</v>

4143
01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4144
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:24.990
<v Speaker 1>That's how crazy fucking thing man.</v>

4145
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Hydraulically fractured.</v>

4146
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.001
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4147
01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:27.834
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

4148
01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:31.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] wells that have been hydraulically fractured might appear in any of</v>

4149
01:57:31.921 --> 01:57:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the eight categories with the obvious exception of not fractured.</v>

4150
01:57:35.851 --> 01:57:40.851
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only one that doesn't have a hydraulically fractured wells</v>

4151
01:57:41.490 --> 01:57:42.360
<v Speaker 1>included in it.</v>

4152
01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:48.150
<v Speaker 1>So a categories that are very likely to be fractured include horizontal,</v>

4153
01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:52.170
<v Speaker 1>hydraulically fractured and unknown shale formation.</v>

4154
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.440
<v Speaker 1>The total of which is 32,000 wells.</v>

4155
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 1>That's most likely to be fractured.</v>

4156
01:57:57.931 --> 01:57:58.764
<v Speaker 1>So they don't know,</v>

4157
01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but at least 32,000 however,</v>

4158
01:58:00.931 --> 01:58:05.931
<v Speaker 1>the number doesn't include any wells from Texas or Colorado where we know</v>

4159
01:58:06.361 --> 01:58:10.170
<v Speaker 1>thousands of wells have been drilled into major shell formation,</v>

4160
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 1>shale formations.</v>

4161
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:15.540
<v Speaker 1>But the data for which had to be placed into categories that were more vague.</v>

4162
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So there's different states have different like regulatory bodies,</v>

4163
01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess the states that are better to to fucking rape the earth and</v>

4164
01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.990
<v Speaker 1>they probably are better off hiding the information to,</v>

4165
01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:29.520
<v Speaker 1>so it seems like,</v>

4166
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:30.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4167
01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying is like 32,000 plus hydraulically fractured ones that they</v>

4168
01:58:35.251 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 1>could locate that they'd know are most likely hydraulically fractured.</v>

4169
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a bunch of the other ones that could,</v>

4170
01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>and the ones that aren't fractured,</v>

4171
01:58:44.441 --> 01:58:49.360
<v Speaker 1>there's only 7,477 of them out of the 1,136,000.</v>

4172
01:58:50.190 --> 01:58:52.500
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy is that they create earthquakes.</v>

4173
01:58:53.670 --> 01:58:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4174
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.961
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked.</v>

4175
01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And then it's still like,</v>

4176
01:58:55.801 --> 01:58:56.071
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

4177
01:58:56.071 --> 01:58:56.904
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it.</v>

4178
01:58:57.090 --> 01:58:57.923
<v Speaker 3>It's worth it.</v>

4179
01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.240
<v Speaker 3>It's worth it if you keep your family warm.</v>

4180
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4181
01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:02.730
<v Speaker 3>It's for American America.</v>

4182
01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Save America.</v>

4183
01:59:04.801 --> 01:59:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Save America's going to be a puddle of Goo Stinky puddle of Goo and dead elk</v>

4184
01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.660
<v Speaker 3>choking bison with their fucking lego though.</v>

4185
01:59:12.661 --> 01:59:15.020
<v Speaker 3>When hair gagging blood out,</v>

4186
01:59:15.021 --> 01:59:17.270
<v Speaker 3>they have a new Ebola that comes only from oil.</v>

4187
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:18.163
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4188
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4189
01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

4190
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I just wish there's a better way to power shit.</v>

4191
01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there would,</v>

4192
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:27.080
<v Speaker 1>like if there was no oil,</v>

4193
01:59:27.110 --> 01:59:28.790
<v Speaker 1>let's say the oil didn't exist,</v>

4194
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:30.800
<v Speaker 1>how far do you think civilization would have gone?</v>

4195
01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no doubt that the combustion engine and making machines and the</v>

4196
01:59:35.511 --> 01:59:39.530
<v Speaker 1>trucks and engines and that's the reason why we became what we are today.</v>

4197
01:59:39.531 --> 01:59:44.531
<v Speaker 1>There's this fucking chaotic mass super organism that we are right.</v>

4198
01:59:45.170 --> 01:59:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So if there was no oil,</v>

4199
01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.330
<v Speaker 1>if that wasn't an an element on earth and the only kid to have like plant based</v>

4200
01:59:50.331 --> 01:59:51.164
<v Speaker 1>oils like</v>

4201
01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:54.620
<v Speaker 1>sunflower oil or some shit.</v>

4202
01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4203
01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:55.970
<v Speaker 1>hemp oil,</v>

4204
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:56.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4205
01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:57.860
<v Speaker 1>which they used for lamps and stuff.</v>

4206
01:59:57.861 --> 02:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>They use like different kinds of oils for lamps but no oil in the ground.</v>

4207
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:02.180
<v Speaker 1>How far would things have gotten?</v>

4208
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno cause how long would it have taken?</v>

4209
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.300
<v Speaker 3>This is the part of the conversation with Brian checks out.</v>

4210
02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:10.893
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4211
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:16.630
<v Speaker 3>who knows like cause how long would it have been before you'd found an alternate</v>

4212
02:00:16.631 --> 02:00:16.841
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

4213
02:00:16.841 --> 02:00:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Like the electric car,</v>

4214
02:00:18.011 --> 02:00:19.180
<v Speaker 3>like how long did that take?</v>

4215
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:19.691
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>

4216
02:00:19.691 --> 02:00:20.350
<v Speaker 3>But you need it.</v>

4217
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:22.840
<v Speaker 3>You need combustion engines to make all those things.</v>

4218
02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 3>See what making an electric car,</v>

4219
02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:25.300
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4220
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:30.300
<v Speaker 3>you need an engine to take the parts to get the parts to the car manufacturer to</v>

4221
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:31.420
<v Speaker 3>deliver the stuff.</v>

4222
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:33.370
<v Speaker 3>Like those are all being delivered with trucks,</v>

4223
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4224
02:00:34.210 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Like this idea that like you get electric car and your Karma free.</v>

4225
02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:38.740
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>

4226
02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:39.281
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

4227
02:00:39.281 --> 02:00:40.300
<v Speaker 3>that technology would,</v>

4228
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:42.750
<v Speaker 3>it had been created for the manufacturing.</v>

4229
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Everything would had to been run electrically.</v>

4230
02:00:44.650 --> 02:00:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4231
02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.390
<v Speaker 3>But how long would it have taken?</v>

4232
02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Forever to discover.</v>

4233
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4234
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:48.820
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

4235
02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:49.431
<v Speaker 3>Without the,</v>

4236
02:00:49.431 --> 02:00:53.200
<v Speaker 3>the motor to take the parts to put it together.</v>

4237
02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you had to pick up the tire somewhere and driving.</v>

4238
02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Those aren't electric trucks,</v>

4239
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4240
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:00.370
<v Speaker 3>it would have been like wagons.</v>

4241
02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:01.840
<v Speaker 3>That was so many years.</v>

4242
02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Oxen would have had oxen pulling your fucking tires.</v>

4243
02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And then how are they going to figure out a way to power up these machines?</v>

4244
02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>What's the going to fire up the electricity?</v>

4245
02:01:12.141 --> 02:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna use that dam and the dam fires up the electricity for these</v>

4246
02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>machines and these machines build this engine and,</v>

4247
02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and is there enough electricity to charge batteries and where are you guys</v>

4248
02:01:22.161 --> 02:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>getting the batteries?</v>

4249
02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Where are you getting the minerals that go into batteries?</v>

4250
02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:26.000
<v Speaker 3>You've got to go to Afghanistan,</v>

4251
02:01:26.001 --> 02:01:26.241
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4252
02:01:26.241 --> 02:01:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4253
02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:27.680
<v Speaker 3>you got a drill for them.</v>

4254
02:01:27.710 --> 02:01:29.000
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to get to Afghanistan?</v>

4255
02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.150
<v Speaker 3>The oxen can't swim.</v>

4256
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:33.560
<v Speaker 3>You gotta take a fucking raft,</v>

4257
02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:36.080
<v Speaker 3>fill it up with minerals from Afghanistan.</v>

4258
02:01:36.081 --> 02:01:37.700
<v Speaker 3>If floaty back to America,</v>

4259
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.170
<v Speaker 3>build your stupid electric.</v>

4260
02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:45.140
<v Speaker 3>The battery would have been invented in like 1973 it would have taken that long.</v>

4261
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 3>This is what Obama meant when he was like,</v>

4262
02:01:46.701 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 3>when you started a smart built small business,</v>

4263
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:50.143
<v Speaker 3>you didn't build that.</v>

4264
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:51.643
<v Speaker 3>That's what he meant.</v>

4265
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:53.060
<v Speaker 3>The infrastructure.</v>

4266
02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.700
<v Speaker 3>You cannot have an electric car without the infrastructure.</v>

4267
02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4268
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:59.420
<v Speaker 3>They created batteries back in the Egyptian days though.</v>

4269
02:01:59.600 --> 02:01:59.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4270
02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:00.531
<v Speaker 3>So they might,</v>

4271
02:02:00.531 --> 02:02:01.364
<v Speaker 3>might have been,</v>

4272
02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I think they could have probably done something.</v>

4273
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:04.400
<v Speaker 3>It would have been,</v>

4274
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:05.930
<v Speaker 3>well those batteries were dog shit.</v>

4275
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:06.793
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

4276
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>

4277
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:09.620
<v Speaker 3>iPhone batteries are amazing.</v>

4278
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:10.820
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even iPhone one.</v>

4279
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even close.</v>

4280
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:12.621
<v Speaker 3>They were stupid.</v>

4281
02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't even Duracell.</v>

4282
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Those bitches could even power a light.</v>

4283
02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you couldn't like I have like the,</v>

4284
02:02:18.450 --> 02:02:18.951
<v Speaker 3>the light,</v>

4285
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 3>the power is your cell phone.</v>

4286
02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:20.841
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

4287
02:02:20.841 --> 02:02:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I went out to close my chicken coop last night and uh,</v>

4288
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:25.100
<v Speaker 3>when I use my phone as a flashlight,</v>

4289
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:26.390
<v Speaker 3>the new iPhone has a,</v>

4290
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.140
<v Speaker 3>an uh,</v>

4291
02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.960
<v Speaker 3>like builtin flashlight thing.</v>

4292
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4293
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.910
<v Speaker 3>You slide this thing up and he hit that and boom,</v>

4294
02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:32.744
<v Speaker 3>you've got a flashlight.</v>

4295
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 3>It takes two seconds.</v>

4296
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:34.530
<v Speaker 3>It's built in.</v>

4297
02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:35.810
<v Speaker 3>It's such a slick thing.</v>

4298
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.333
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4299
02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:38.841
<v Speaker 3>God's side.</v>

4300
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:39.561
<v Speaker 3>That wouldn't work.</v>

4301
02:02:39.561 --> 02:02:40.161
<v Speaker 3>That it's stupid.</v>

4302
02:02:40.161 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian battery,</v>

4303
02:02:41.001 --> 02:02:42.270
<v Speaker 3>big goof ass thing.</v>

4304
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Got a carrier on this pot.</v>

4305
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Copper core.</v>

4306
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.781
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4307
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:48.620
<v Speaker 3>He made a big one.</v>

4308
02:02:48.621 --> 02:02:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Like the size of a,</v>

4309
02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:50.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4310
02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.673
<v Speaker 3>like a pyramid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You stepped pyramid was all battery the whole time.</v>

4312
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:55.191
<v Speaker 3>Do you imagine that?</v>

4313
02:02:55.191 --> 02:02:57.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was soothing to our battery.</v>

4314
02:02:57.831 --> 02:02:59.800
<v Speaker 3>We'll be up for her whole pyramids.</v>

4315
02:02:59.810 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 3>A post that was like one of the crazy conspiracy theory hypothesis.</v>

4316
02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 3>The pyramid was a giant,</v>

4317
02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:06.140
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a power plant.</v>

4318
02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4319
02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:06.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4320
02:03:06.951 --> 02:03:07.131
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4321
02:03:07.131 --> 02:03:08.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah of course.</v>

4322
02:03:08.190 --> 02:03:09.023
<v Speaker 3>Believe it.</v>

4323
02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:10.730
<v Speaker 3>If you can think it up,</v>

4324
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:15.790
<v Speaker 3>somebody has like probably written blog entries about it doesn't matter how</v>

4325
02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 3>cookie the idea is.</v>

4326
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 3>If you could think up a Kooky idea,</v>

4327
02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:21.350
<v Speaker 3>somebody has written some shit about it.</v>

4328
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:25.310
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of bugs the other day because there was a praying mantis that was</v>

4329
02:03:25.311 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>on my porch that just hung out the whole whole day and he has these huge</v>

4330
02:03:29.601 --> 02:03:30.530
<v Speaker 3>antennas and I was like,</v>

4331
02:03:30.531 --> 02:03:34.400
<v Speaker 3>isn't it weird that we don't really focus like these bugs have like antennas on</v>

4332
02:03:34.401 --> 02:03:36.020
<v Speaker 3>them like in the future,</v>

4333
02:03:36.021 --> 02:03:39.410
<v Speaker 3>like we're going to find out that these are like aliens that are communicating</v>

4334
02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 3>with each other through some,</v>

4335
02:03:40.791 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 3>well they might as well be aliens.</v>

4336
02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.510
<v Speaker 3>We just don't give a shit about him cause they're a little,</v>

4337
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:45.403
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4338
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:46.840
<v Speaker 3>we can just kick them out of the way.</v>

4339
02:03:46.890 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Little drones,</v>

4340
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you know their drones for aliens.</v>

4341
02:03:49.401 --> 02:03:51.440
<v Speaker 3>There's like these little what they are.</v>

4342
02:03:51.441 --> 02:03:54.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird little life form that shares the world with us that has no morals,</v>

4343
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.843
<v Speaker 3>no ethics.</v>

4344
02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.820
<v Speaker 3>So ruthless coldhearted emotionless killers.</v>

4345
02:03:59.090 --> 02:04:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And they have a hard skeleton.</v>

4346
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:01.820
<v Speaker 3>They don't need each other's touch.</v>

4347
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4348
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>They have this very bizarre military organization as far as they have a queen,</v>

4349
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4350
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:08.840
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

4351
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:09.420
<v Speaker 3>they have a,</v>

4352
02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:10.720
<v Speaker 3>the worker bees and they're,</v>

4353
02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:13.310
<v Speaker 3>they're building shelter and protecting the hive.</v>

4354
02:04:13.311 --> 02:04:14.870
<v Speaker 3>And they're weird man.</v>

4355
02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:17.300
<v Speaker 3>We just don't think of him as being so weird cause they're little.</v>

4356
02:04:17.301 --> 02:04:18.950
<v Speaker 3>And we could just wait for him like that.</v>

4357
02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:20.600
<v Speaker 3>But if a bear this big,</v>

4358
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:21.853
<v Speaker 3>oh I know.</v>

4359
02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4360
02:04:23.150 --> 02:04:24.080
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of them it's like,</v>

4361
02:04:24.081 --> 02:04:24.320
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

4362
02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Like if they all of a sudden became big,</v>

4363
02:04:25.881 --> 02:04:26.750
<v Speaker 3>we're like fuck.</v>

4364
02:04:26.751 --> 02:04:27.200
<v Speaker 3>And then we're like,</v>

4365
02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:27.651
<v Speaker 3>oh cool.</v>

4366
02:04:27.651 --> 02:04:28.730
<v Speaker 3>They only live for four days.</v>

4367
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:29.803
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

4368
02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Neutralized soon.</v>

4369
02:04:31.670 --> 02:04:31.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4370
02:04:31.851 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 3>But there's so many of them.</v>

4371
02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4372
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Before we start killing them off with cell phones,</v>

4373
02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>cell and pesticides.</v>

4374
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the third one that's whacked them out.</v>

4375
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you were a kid,</v>

4376
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>bees were everywhere.</v>

4377
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How often do you see being,</v>

4378
02:04:44.070 --> 02:04:46.140
<v Speaker 1>have you seen bees every day at my house?</v>

4379
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4380
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>but do you see bees like you saw on beans when you were a kid?</v>

4381
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4382
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tended be like bees nests everywhere.</v>

4383
02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.190
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>

4384
02:04:52.190 --> 02:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4385
02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4386
02:04:52.810 --> 02:04:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4387
02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Sucks.</v>

4388
02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you got a sweet spot for bees and wasps.</v>

4389
02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

4390
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Populations are pretty down though aren't thing.</v>

4391
02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:01.201
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like a,</v>

4392
02:05:01.201 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a major concern.</v>

4393
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's say dropping bee populations.</v>

4394
02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's play another game.</v>

4395
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I say bee populations are down by 40%.</v>

4396
02:05:09.690 --> 02:05:10.231
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

4397
02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:11.064
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4398
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I would say 25,</v>

4399
02:05:14.971 --> 02:05:16.860
<v Speaker 1>20% to 25%.</v>

4400
02:05:16.861 --> 02:05:17.191
<v Speaker 1>What'd He say,</v>

4401
02:05:17.191 --> 02:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Ryan?</v>

4402
02:05:17.650 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4403
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I say it's up.</v>

4404
02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:19.651
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

4405
02:05:19.651 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big conspiracy.</v>

4406
02:05:21.061 --> 02:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I think these are more ever because it all around Brian's house.</v>

4407
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>We have a bee problem lead to stop these bees.</v>

4408
02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4409
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>30%.</v>

4410
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4411
02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>it's even crazier.</v>

4412
02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4413
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:37.910
<v Speaker 1>30% in the U s beekeepers experience losses of 40 or 50% or more.</v>

4414
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:39.023
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4415
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4416
02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:39.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4417
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:44.400
<v Speaker 1>just says commercial B operations prepared to transport their hives to the</v>

4418
02:05:44.401 --> 02:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>country's largest pollinator event.</v>

4419
02:05:46.141 --> 02:05:49.710
<v Speaker 1>The fertile is fertilizing of California's almond trees.</v>

4420
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:50.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4421
02:05:50.101 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

4422
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

4423
02:05:52.201 --> 02:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4424
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess they hire people to go do that.</v>

4425
02:05:54.570 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>They bring bees and the bees a populate or,</v>

4426
02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:58.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4427
02:05:58.410 --> 02:06:00.390
<v Speaker 1>bees pollinate these plants.</v>

4428
02:06:00.391 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

4429
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4430
02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Spread out across 800,000 acres.</v>

4431
02:06:05.251 --> 02:06:10.251
<v Speaker 1>California's almond orchards typically require 1.6 million domesticated bee</v>

4432
02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:15.060
<v Speaker 1>colonies to pollinate the flowering trees and produce what has become the</v>

4433
02:06:15.061 --> 02:06:17.760
<v Speaker 1>state's largest overseas agricultural export.</v>

4434
02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that almonds are largest overseas export.</v>

4435
02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:23.513
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

4436
02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Because weeds illegal bitch,</v>

4437
02:06:27.110 --> 02:06:30.870
<v Speaker 1>if we was legal t you don't think that people in like Portugal would be dying to</v>

4438
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:33.270
<v Speaker 1>get ahold of some Goddamn California weed.</v>

4439
02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4440
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>but given widespread be losses to so called colony collapse disorder.</v>

4441
02:06:38.821 --> 02:06:39.301
<v Speaker 1>This winter,</v>

4442
02:06:39.301 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>California's almond growers were able to pollinate their crop only through an</v>

4443
02:06:43.171 --> 02:06:48.030
<v Speaker 1>intense nationwide push to cobble together the necessary number of healthy bee</v>

4444
02:06:48.031 --> 02:06:48.864
<v Speaker 1>colonies.</v>

4445
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:49.891
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4446
02:06:49.891 --> 02:06:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Nationwide push.</v>

4447
02:06:51.091 --> 02:06:52.020
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

4448
02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That's how they grow almonds at the top saying it's amazing.</v>

4449
02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:58.500
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

4450
02:06:58.830 --> 02:07:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I love when I find out something like this where I had no idea that they,</v>

4451
02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that I thought bees,</v>

4452
02:07:03.781 --> 02:07:04.061
<v Speaker 1>they may,</v>

4453
02:07:04.061 --> 02:07:05.310
<v Speaker 1>they just made honey and you know,</v>

4454
02:07:05.311 --> 02:07:06.121
<v Speaker 1>they're pollinated shit,</v>

4455
02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know that they needed him to grow almonds.</v>

4456
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4457
02:07:08.850 --> 02:07:10.500
<v Speaker 1>they're domesticated.</v>

4458
02:07:10.530 --> 02:07:11.370
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>

4459
02:07:11.371 --> 02:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4460
02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought they only did one thing.</v>

4461
02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They make two delicious items.</v>

4462
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Almonds.</v>

4463
02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:17.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4464
02:07:17.041 --> 02:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't around,</v>

4465
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.530
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

4466
02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But that these colonies were down and that in order to pollinate all of their</v>

4467
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:25.681
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>

4468
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:26.280
<v Speaker 1>they need to,</v>

4469
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.810
<v Speaker 1>they needed to bring in other bees.</v>

4470
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>There's not like another possibility.</v>

4471
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:30.631
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4472
02:07:30.631 --> 02:07:30.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4473
02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:30.871

02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:31.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4476
02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:31.351
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4477
02:07:31.351 --> 02:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>We need bees.</v>

4478
02:07:32.490 --> 02:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there another method?</v>

4479
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

4480

4493
02:07:39.701 --> 02:07:43.210
<v Speaker 1>That really puts into light how important bees are.</v>

4494
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Something like that that really makes you realize like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this beekeeper's outfit and he's like handling these bees and moving them around</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's got a fucking crazy suit as well,</v>

4522
02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and that is fully suited up for an invasion of attacking monsters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He is</v>

4526
02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:35.810
<v Speaker 7>the greatest movie of all time.</v>

4527
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 7>What's,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Anything positive you fuck up?</v>

4530
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:42.623
<v Speaker 7>Bees?</v>

4531
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:46.940
<v Speaker 7>WASPS would say the ones that can keep stinging you as where it'd be like,</v>

4532
02:08:46.941 --> 02:08:47.300
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

4533
02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:47.780
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

4534
02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:48.920
<v Speaker 7>It's like a kamikaze mission.</v>

4535
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:49.880
<v Speaker 7>It's like one and done</v>

4536
02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:51.400
<v Speaker 1>wasps.</v>

4537
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:51.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4538
02:08:51.731 --> 02:08:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that video?</v>

4539
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese Hornets killing the beehive?</v>

4540
02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4541
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:56.771
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

4542
02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 1>it's the weirdest video ever,</v>

4543
02:08:58.241 --> 02:08:58.571
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4544
02:08:58.571 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Because it's this.</v>

4545
02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.000
<v Speaker 1>If we put it on,</v>

4546
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably get us kicked off of Youtube.</v>

4547
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:03.071
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4548
02:09:03.071 --> 02:09:03.904
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it works?</v>

4549
02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one really.</v>

4550
02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those ones,</v>

4551
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:07.270
<v Speaker 1>these nature documentaries,</v>

4552
02:09:07.271 --> 02:09:07.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4553
02:09:07.631 --> 02:09:10.360
<v Speaker 1>they'd go after you and have you pulled from youtube what?</v>

4554
02:09:10.450 --> 02:09:10.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4555
02:09:10.721 --> 02:09:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Nature documentaries.</v>

4556
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:12.663
<v Speaker 1>People own them.</v>

4557
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4558
02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that probably cost a grip of money to film high speed video footage of some</v>

4559
02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Japanese Hornets.</v>

4560
02:09:18.491 --> 02:09:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Fucking up some honey bees.</v>

4561
02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:21.610
<v Speaker 1>But just do me a favor.</v>

4562
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Go just Google Japanese Hornets.</v>

4563
02:09:24.061 --> 02:09:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up honeybees and check it out because it's amazing.</v>

4564
02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.760
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>

4565
02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They're the cut their heads off.</v>

4566
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>They just cut the honeybees heads off and like,</v>

4567
02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 30 bees killed 30,000 bees or 30 hornets killed 30,000 bees,</v>

4568
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:39.730
<v Speaker 1>something nutty like that.</v>

4569
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like darn near 11 war,</v>

4570
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:42.611
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a war.</v>

4571
02:09:42.611 --> 02:09:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like you with a hatchet and a room full of babies.</v>

4572
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no,</v>

4573
02:09:47.851 --> 02:09:48.910
<v Speaker 1>no one's fighting back.</v>

4574
02:09:48.911 --> 02:09:49.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4575
02:09:49.151 --> 02:09:49.984
<v Speaker 1>they can't do anything.</v>

4576
02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:51.490
<v Speaker 1>They just chopped their heads off</v>

4577
02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>or something along those lines.</v>

4578
02:09:55.151 --> 02:09:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4579
02:09:55.570 --> 02:09:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way they can kill them is they have to overheat them.</v>

4580
02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:01.300
<v Speaker 1>So they do is they all swarm on top on the hold the,</v>

4581
02:10:01.301 --> 02:10:02.820
<v Speaker 1>the Hornet down and they,</v>

4582
02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 1>they keep buzzing.</v>

4583
02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 1>They buzz on them and raise his internal temperature until he dies.</v>

4584
02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4585
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4586
02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way they can kill him.</v>

4587
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:11.561
<v Speaker 1>They can't kill him.</v>

4588
02:10:11.561 --> 02:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I stadium doesn't work.</v>

4589
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't get through their fucking armor.</v>

4590
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So they just turn the heat up until they die.</v>

4591
02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.300
<v Speaker 1>They smother him,</v>

4592
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they fucking torture them.</v>

4593
02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:21.933
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way to do it.</v>

4594
02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:22.773
<v Speaker 1>What else would you do?</v>

4595
02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to eat your babies.</v>

4596
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:25.203
<v Speaker 1>Chop their heads off.</v>

4597
02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:26.413
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

4598
02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

4599
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:28.250
<v Speaker 7>crazy that he's like,</v>

4600
02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.330
<v Speaker 7>invasions are happening with living a such a small level.</v>

4601
02:10:32.331 --> 02:10:35.630
<v Speaker 7>You think bees are dumb be just flying around making honey and meanwhile they're</v>

4602
02:10:35.631 --> 02:10:35.751
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4603
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:36.584
<v Speaker 7>here's the plan.</v>

4604
02:10:36.670 --> 02:10:37.400
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>

4605
02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.060
<v Speaker 7>we're going in and we're going to heat the fucking place up until everyone dies.</v>

4606
02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:41.691
<v Speaker 7>Well the the,</v>

4607
02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:41.931
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

4608
02:10:41.931 --> 02:10:42.141
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4609
02:10:42.141 --> 02:10:43.670
<v Speaker 7>the bees do that to the hornets,</v>

4610
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.440
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

4611
02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the do,</v>

4612
02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:46.540
<v Speaker 1>what they do is say one horn,</v>

4613
02:10:46.541 --> 02:10:49.900
<v Speaker 1>it will be a scout Hornet and the scout Horner will show up and when the scout</v>

4614
02:10:49.901 --> 02:10:50.591
<v Speaker 1>horn it shows up.</v>

4615
02:10:50.591 --> 02:10:51.970
<v Speaker 1>That's when the bee swarm it,</v>

4616
02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:55.510
<v Speaker 1>the bee swarm it and hold it down and try to kill it because if they don't kill</v>

4617
02:10:55.511 --> 02:10:55.631
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4618
02:10:55.631 --> 02:10:56.620
<v Speaker 1>if it gets back to the horn,</v>

4619
02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:57.191
<v Speaker 1>snazzy goes,</v>

4620
02:10:57.191 --> 02:10:57.911
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

4621
02:10:57.911 --> 02:10:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I found Sam B.</v>

4622
02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:01.120
<v Speaker 1>That's when shit gets crazy.</v>

4623
02:11:01.150 --> 02:11:03.340
<v Speaker 1>That's when they fly back and fuck everybody up.</v>

4624
02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

4625
02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:04.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4626
02:11:04.841 --> 02:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>That world,</v>

4627
02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the Hornet B,</v>

4628
02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:07.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4629
02:11:07.811 --> 02:11:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I think of them as sort of the same sort of category.</v>

4630
02:11:09.791 --> 02:11:10.900
<v Speaker 1>These flying bugs.</v>

4631
02:11:10.901 --> 02:11:14.290
<v Speaker 1>It's staying like that world is unbelievably ruthless.</v>

4632
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:15.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4633
02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.080
<v Speaker 1>The fact that first of all,</v>

4634
02:11:17.081 --> 02:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's their stingers kill them too,</v>

4635
02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:20.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4636
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Like when they extinct a person or something,</v>

4637
02:11:22.481 --> 02:11:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it pulls out of their body.</v>

4638
02:11:23.771 --> 02:11:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Like it's this giant sword that pulls out their body and they die.</v>

4639
02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.580
<v Speaker 1>That happens when they have sex that happens when they sting.</v>

4640
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4641
02:11:31.361 --> 02:11:33.580
<v Speaker 1>They only live to be like a week old.</v>

4642
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're lucky and if they sting you,</v>

4643
02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:37.354
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

4644
02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.950
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

4645
02:11:38.951 --> 02:11:41.290
<v Speaker 1>like the female can stink all the time.</v>

4646
02:11:41.291 --> 02:11:42.124
<v Speaker 1>Like the Queen,</v>

4647
02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.260
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have to worry about her Barb coming out.</v>

4648
02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:46.060
<v Speaker 1>She can just staying all day long.</v>

4649
02:11:46.061 --> 02:11:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4650
02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but all she does is seek out other females.</v>

4651
02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:55.080
<v Speaker 1>So she walks around the hive and smells each individual little honeycomb in</v>

4652
02:11:56.261 --> 02:11:59.590
<v Speaker 1>those little combs where the bees grow up in whatever that's on a honeycomb.</v>

4653
02:11:59.591 --> 02:11:59.891
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

4654
02:11:59.891 --> 02:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4655
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:01.143
<v Speaker 1>one of those things,</v>

4656
02:12:01.650 --> 02:12:02.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a comb.</v>

4657
02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

4658
02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever those little pods larva are growing.</v>

4659
02:12:07.330 --> 02:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>If she finds that it's a female,</v>

4660
02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:10.173
<v Speaker 1>she uses her,</v>

4661
02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>her fucking Stinger and stabs the baby.</v>

4662
02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4663
02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4664
02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:14.913
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>

4665
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.980
<v Speaker 1>No other women,</v>

4666
02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:18.843
<v Speaker 1>no other women.</v>

4667
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.511
<v Speaker 1>Other women.</v>

4668
02:12:19.511 --> 02:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>There can be only one.</v>

4669
02:12:20.351 --> 02:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>She's Highlander.</v>

4670
02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4671
02:12:22.090 --> 02:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4672
02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>She walks around and stabs all the females because it fucks all the dudes to</v>

4673
02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

4674
02:12:27.490 --> 02:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4675
02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Fucks him to death.</v>

4676
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>She's as as gangster as fuck.</v>

4677
02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a gangster pitch.</v>

4678
02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4679
02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>That might be the most gangster bitch of the animal kingdom.</v>

4680
02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4681
02:12:38.610 --> 02:12:43.610
<v Speaker 7>I mean powerful sword on her pussy because how many other like praying mantis or</v>

4682
02:12:44.070 --> 02:12:45.150
<v Speaker 7>black widows I guess.</v>

4683
02:12:45.151 --> 02:12:45.390
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4684
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.020
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4685
02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:46.853
<v Speaker 7>Here's the mail.</v>

4686
02:12:47.130 --> 02:12:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Who would win in a fight?</v>

4687
02:12:48.121 --> 02:12:50.520
<v Speaker 1>A praying mantis or a wasp praying mantis.</v>

4688
02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4689
02:12:51.450 --> 02:12:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4690
02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with the wasp wasp versus praying man.</v>

4691
02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 7>I'd say praying man.</v>

4692
02:12:55.641 --> 02:12:59.920
<v Speaker 7>A female praying man has decapitates her like fucks the dude and then yeah,</v>

4693
02:13:00.070 --> 02:13:01.250
<v Speaker 7>those guys are bitches.</v>

4694
02:13:01.730 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the man is versus wasp.</v>

4695
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:04.160
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4696
02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.900
<v Speaker 7>There's probably reach a rent.</v>

4697
02:13:05.901 --> 02:13:07.070
<v Speaker 7>Like if the wasp was like,</v>

4698
02:13:07.071 --> 02:13:08.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to stab you in the back.</v>

4699
02:13:08.361 --> 02:13:09.111
<v Speaker 7>That praying man,</v>

4700
02:13:09.111 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 7>that's probably couldn't get it.</v>

4701
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4702
02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.510
<v Speaker 7>but maybe the,</v>

4703
02:13:11.511 --> 02:13:16.511
<v Speaker 7>they have like hard skeletons that they can't be pierced by bees.</v>

4704
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:18.070
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to go praying mantis.</v>

4705
02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:19.473
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

4706
02:13:20.010 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 7>Is that your bird?</v>

4707
02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:21.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4708
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:22.590
<v Speaker 7>I'm watching this pregnant.</v>

4709
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:24.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4710
02:13:24.091 --> 02:13:27.960
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is if only the wasp knew how vulnerable the plane praying</v>

4711
02:13:27.961 --> 02:13:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Mantis is,</v>

4712
02:13:29.650 --> 02:13:31.770
<v Speaker 1>could in numbers easily sting at to death,</v>

4713
02:13:31.771 --> 02:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

4714
02:13:32.431 --> 02:13:35.220
<v Speaker 1>The answer lies in the camouflage strategy of the Mantis.</v>

4715
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And now the wasp usually visualizes the mantis among the foliage.</v>

4716
02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:42.000
<v Speaker 1>The mantis is not seen as a threat to the wasp.</v>

4717
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Large female praying mantis almost ready to produce her egg case needs one last</v>

4718
02:13:47.731 --> 02:13:48.564
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>

4719
02:13:49.170 --> 02:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a European wasp.</v>

4720
02:13:50.551 --> 02:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It says the bullies of the insect world insect mimicry.</v>

4721
02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:55.080
<v Speaker 1>They oh,</v>

4722
02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:55.913
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4723
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:56.780
<v Speaker 1>So guests,</v>

4724
02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:56.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4725
02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:57.571
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer.</v>

4726
02:13:57.571 --> 02:13:59.670
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking praying names.</v>

4727
02:13:59.671 --> 02:14:01.490
<v Speaker 1>That giant Hornet versus a praying man.</v>

4728
02:14:01.491 --> 02:14:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the whoa dude.</v>

4729
02:14:02.921 --> 02:14:06.330
<v Speaker 1>This praying Mantis fucked this wasp up quick.</v>

4730
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:08.220
<v Speaker 1>The Wasp is walking around.</v>

4731
02:14:08.221 --> 02:14:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

4732
02:14:08.610 --> 02:14:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty dope.</v>

4733
02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish we could show it and not get pulled off of youtube.</v>

4734
02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Whatever happens to those when we get pulled over those.</v>

4735
02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:14.400

02:14:16.170 --> 02:14:17.003
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no?</v>

4738
02:14:17.250 --> 02:14:17.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

4739
02:14:17.881 --> 02:14:18.960
<v Speaker 1>This is worth watching,</v>

4740
02:14:18.961 --> 02:14:19.794
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4741

02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4743
02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:22.914
<v Speaker 1>that's the one I'm watching.</v>

4744
02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:23.953
<v Speaker 1>Praying masters.</v>

4745
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I think we could make,</v>

4746
02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 1>well I'm praying mantises are gangster.</v>

4747
02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:32.310
<v Speaker 1>They fuck wasps.</v>

4748
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:34.320
<v Speaker 1>The wasp don't have a chance.</v>

4749
02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:36.150
<v Speaker 1>He just holds them and starts eating them.</v>

4750
02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:36.541
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4751
02:14:36.541 --> 02:14:37.261
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>

4752
02:14:37.261 --> 02:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>They're so strong.</v>

4753
02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 1>They just eat the wasps back.</v>

4754
02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Just hang on and them.</v>

4755
02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:43.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4756
02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking vicious,</v>

4757
02:14:44.521 --> 02:14:45.360
<v Speaker 1>vicious animal.</v>

4758
02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:47.550
<v Speaker 1>The world of those,</v>

4759
02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:50.580
<v Speaker 1>those creatures is just so evil and alien.</v>

4760
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:53.190
<v Speaker 1>We just don't think about it cause they're so small.</v>

4761
02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4762
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:54.581
<v Speaker 3>Their level.</v>

4763
02:14:54.581 --> 02:14:56.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like ruthless people.</v>

4764
02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:57.131
<v Speaker 3>Like not people,</v>

4765
02:14:57.131 --> 02:14:58.210
<v Speaker 3>but the other animals are like,</v>

4766
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:59.920
<v Speaker 3>they run scared.</v>

4767
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:04.750
<v Speaker 3>But for us it's like a pair of vans can just take them both out at once.</v>

4768
02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:05.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4769
02:15:05.531 --> 02:15:09.550
<v Speaker 1>They're these other bees or swimming or a flying round.</v>

4770
02:15:09.551 --> 02:15:10.161
<v Speaker 1>This praying man.</v>

4771
02:15:10.161 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not sure how to save their friend,</v>

4772
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:16.120
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what to do while this wasp is getting eaten alive,</v>

4773
02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:17.800
<v Speaker 1>eating the back of his head.</v>

4774
02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:19.060
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific,</v>

4775
02:15:19.061 --> 02:15:19.894
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4776
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:21.820
<v Speaker 1>He's just holding onto it and just eating it.</v>

4777
02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

4778
02:15:23.530 --> 02:15:23.951
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

4779
02:15:23.951 --> 02:15:27.640
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at it in this tiny scale so it doesn't seem that horrific.</v>

4780
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:31.180
<v Speaker 1>But if a praying mantis is a size of a Giraffe,</v>

4781
02:15:32.530 --> 02:15:33.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4782
02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>and we saw it chase after a hippo and jacket and it was fucking up this hippo in</v>

4783
02:15:39.191 --> 02:15:42.040
<v Speaker 1>front of all the other hippos and there wasn't a God damn thing they could do</v>

4784
02:15:42.041 --> 02:15:42.371
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

4785
02:15:42.371 --> 02:15:46.510
<v Speaker 1>They just had to sit there and just deal with the fact had this huge mechanized</v>

4786
02:15:46.511 --> 02:15:47.440
<v Speaker 1>looking beach</v>

4787
02:15:50.050 --> 02:15:51.710
<v Speaker 1>taking chunks out of the hippos head</v>

4788
02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:54.240
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

4789
02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:54.841
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

4790
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Do we go over there and save him?</v>

4791
02:15:56.431 --> 02:15:57.480
<v Speaker 3>What do we do?</v>

4792
02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like size is in the animal kingdom is so relevant because when you</v>

4793
02:16:03.081 --> 02:16:04.040
<v Speaker 1>get really low,</v>

4794
02:16:04.041 --> 02:16:04.521
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4795
02:16:04.521 --> 02:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a pre masters Jack that be,</v>

4796
02:16:08.150 --> 02:16:08.600
<v Speaker 1>they don't</v>

4797
02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:09.530
<v Speaker 3>play games,</v>

4798
02:16:09.531 --> 02:16:09.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4799
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:10.970
<v Speaker 3>They don't play games.</v>

4800
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:12.350
<v Speaker 3>They're so strong.</v>

4801
02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:14.900
<v Speaker 3>They just hold onto the beach and start eating them.</v>

4802
02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Is that his death rattle?</v>

4803
02:16:17.090 --> 02:16:17.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4804
02:16:17.241 --> 02:16:18.500
<v Speaker 3>He's just trying to fly away.</v>

4805
02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:20.600
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to fly away.</v>

4806
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Look how much stronger those things are.</v>

4807
02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:24.740
<v Speaker 3>That's like he plants his leg,</v>

4808
02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:26.570
<v Speaker 3>John Jones versus Bobby Lee.</v>

4809
02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:28.033
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

4810
02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 3>that's what that's like.</v>

4811
02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4812
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 4>that's what kind of a battle that is.</v>

4813
02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:32.711
<v Speaker 4>Just holds them.</v>

4814
02:16:32.711 --> 02:16:33.431
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what he does.</v>

4815
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:34.330
<v Speaker 4>You're not going anywhere.</v>

4816
02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:35.893
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

4817
02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:38.940
<v Speaker 4>And this a praying mantis is a mother fucker,</v>

4818
02:16:38.941 --> 02:16:39.774
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4819
02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Just hold on home and starts eating the,</v>

4820
02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:44.761
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4821
02:16:44.761 --> 02:16:45.720
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird world.</v>

4822
02:16:45.721 --> 02:16:46.381
<v Speaker 4>It's just tiny,</v>

4823
02:16:46.381 --> 02:16:46.651
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>

4824
02:16:46.651 --> 02:16:47.031
<v Speaker 4>tiny seed.</v>

4825
02:16:47.031 --> 02:16:47.864
<v Speaker 4>We don't freak,</v>

4826
02:16:48.330 --> 02:16:49.170
<v Speaker 4>but if it was big,</v>

4827
02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:51.090
<v Speaker 4>it would be way more ruthless than what we're seeing.</v>

4828
02:16:51.091 --> 02:16:52.620
<v Speaker 4>Like even amongst mammals,</v>

4829
02:16:52.650 --> 02:16:53.880
<v Speaker 4>like Predator mammals,</v>

4830
02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.430
<v Speaker 4>when we see like a lion take out a gazelle,</v>

4831
02:16:56.431 --> 02:17:00.420
<v Speaker 4>like I guess that's not as creepy to me because they're mammals.</v>

4832
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:02.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4833
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:06.680
<v Speaker 4>If I saw a giant praying mantis take out a gazelle,</v>

4834
02:17:06.681 --> 02:17:07.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd be way more freaked out.</v>

4835
02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:11.540
<v Speaker 4>The way they look at it looks more alien.</v>

4836
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4837
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:14.063
<v Speaker 4>they're weird.</v>

4838
02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Bugged out eyes and they're crazy arms and their antenna that gets some kind of</v>

4839
02:17:18.291 --> 02:17:19.640
<v Speaker 4>weird internet.</v>

4840
02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:20.241
<v Speaker 4>All of it,</v>

4841
02:17:20.241 --> 02:17:21.074
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4842
02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:24.910
<v Speaker 4>If a praying mantis didn't exist and you got to see this,</v>

4843
02:17:24.911 --> 02:17:25.281
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

4844
02:17:25.281 --> 02:17:25.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4845
02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:28.700
<v Speaker 4>what if this was a character in a movie?</v>

4846
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Like what planet is this on?</v>

4847
02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4848
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:32.840
<v Speaker 4>That easily could be.</v>

4849
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:33.740
<v Speaker 4>If it was large,</v>

4850
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:37.160
<v Speaker 4>it could be an alien in a movie like the movie alien.</v>

4851
02:17:37.161 --> 02:17:38.260
<v Speaker 4>If that thing was chasing you,</v>

4852
02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:39.410
<v Speaker 4>that'd be just as scary.</v>

4853
02:17:39.470 --> 02:17:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4854
02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:42.050
<v Speaker 4>Big giant ass fucking crab arms.</v>

4855
02:17:42.051 --> 02:17:46.190
<v Speaker 4>It's going to clamp a hold their pride designed after the praying mantis.</v>

4856
02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:47.750
<v Speaker 4>I've some animal like that.</v>

4857
02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:48.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4858
02:17:48.201 --> 02:17:52.250
<v Speaker 4>I bet there's probably definitely some influence those cause if you think about</v>

4859
02:17:52.251 --> 02:17:53.120
<v Speaker 4>like bugs,</v>

4860
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:56.450
<v Speaker 4>bugs are just like what those aliens were like the alien.</v>

4861
02:17:56.450 --> 02:17:58.400
<v Speaker 4>They were like this emotionless,</v>

4862
02:17:58.401 --> 02:17:59.960
<v Speaker 4>ruthless thing.</v>

4863
02:17:59.961 --> 02:18:03.050
<v Speaker 4>They just like started of popped out of the darkness and clamped a hold of you</v>

4864

<v Speaker 4>That's it going like now what bitch?</v>

5301
02:29:01.581 --> 02:29:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Like the something on the ground.</v>

5302
02:29:03.350 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Fucking mouse.</v>

5303
02:29:04.430 --> 02:29:06.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you imagine the physical strength to one of those things?</v>

5304
02:29:06.501 --> 02:29:07.670
<v Speaker 4>It was like the size of a horse.</v>

5305
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

5306
02:29:08.450 --> 02:29:09.283
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

5307
02:29:09.610 --> 02:29:09.801
<v Speaker 4>It would,</v>

5308
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:12.510
<v Speaker 4>they'd be tearing apart cars when I was like,</v>

5309
02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hide my car.</v>

5310
02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:14.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5311
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:15.530
<v Speaker 4>they just rent the car open.</v>

5312
02:29:15.531 --> 02:29:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>

5313
02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:16.820
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that was yours.</v>

5314
02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:18.253
<v Speaker 4>Look at a man.</v>

5315
02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Evil.</v>

5316
02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy.</v>

5317
02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:22.610
<v Speaker 4>We're just so lucky that they're little.</v>

5318
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:24.860
<v Speaker 4>They're like the bugs from starship troopers,</v>

5319
02:29:24.861 --> 02:29:25.694
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5320
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5321
02:29:26.001 --> 02:29:26.520
<v Speaker 4>kind of.</v>

5322
02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:31.110
<v Speaker 4>That's like the best analogy or the best look like him.</v>

5323
02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:33.200
<v Speaker 4>They had it in model like directly after.</v>

5324
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.831
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

5325
02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:34.371
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

5326
02:29:34.371 --> 02:29:35.204
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5327
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:37.580
<v Speaker 4>The starship trooper bugs are fucking awesome.</v>

5328
02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:39.500
<v Speaker 4>That was a silly movie.</v>

5329
02:29:39.501 --> 02:29:43.940
<v Speaker 4>But what are you doing Brando before and after he role in Godfather.</v>

5330
02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Before makeup and after makeup.</v>

5331
02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:46.273
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

5332
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.863
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5333
02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

5334
02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:49.341
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5335
02:29:49.341 --> 02:29:50.360
<v Speaker 4>so they made him look older.</v>

5336
02:29:50.361 --> 02:29:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know they did that.</v>

5337
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:52.071
<v Speaker 4>He almost looked like it.</v>

5338
02:29:52.071 --> 02:29:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Like a George Clooney.</v>

5339
02:29:53.001 --> 02:29:54.470
<v Speaker 4>Brad Pitt Combo right here.</v>

5340
02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:54.591
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5341
02:29:54.591 --> 02:29:56.060
<v Speaker 4>he was a handsome man when he was young.</v>

5342
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.350
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

5343
02:29:57.350 --> 02:30:00.350
<v Speaker 4>What does that have anything to do with what we were talking about?</v>

5344
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:02.331
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

5345
02:30:02.331 --> 02:30:03.680
<v Speaker 4>Conversation killing.</v>

5346
02:30:04.970 --> 02:30:09.650
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about a green bug that destroyed that starship troopers movie</v>

5347
02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:12.080
<v Speaker 4>was a what that would,</v>

5348
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:16.730
<v Speaker 4>that's very realistic in terms of like if there was an invasion by bugs,</v>

5349
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:18.050
<v Speaker 4>we would be getting killed.</v>

5350
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:18.973
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5351
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:20.240
<v Speaker 4>If there was bugs like that.</v>

5352
02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:24.380
<v Speaker 4>Do we even have like what kind of guns would it take to shoot down at giant</v>

5353
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:25.041
<v Speaker 4>praying mantis?</v>

5354
02:30:25.041 --> 02:30:27.440
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to have some fucking serious fire power,</v>

5355
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.970
<v Speaker 4>like a regular rifle.</v>

5356
02:30:28.971 --> 02:30:29.870
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to do it.</v>

5357
02:30:30.350 --> 02:30:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you shot a shotgun and a praying mantis.</v>

5358
02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:34.570
<v Speaker 4>The shit would probably work a sheriff,</v>

5359
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but probably I wonder if they were like,</v>

5360
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:38.240
<v Speaker 4>they're armors and like paneling.</v>

5361
02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:40.453
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's like a,</v>

5362
02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:42.740
<v Speaker 4>like an Armadillo is just like straight through,</v>

5363
02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:44.140
<v Speaker 4>but they seem like they have like,</v>

5364
02:30:44.141 --> 02:30:46.790
<v Speaker 4>like Batman has like panels and move around.</v>

5365
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:50.870
<v Speaker 4>It seems like that's what they are like why bet they grow shit back to,</v>

5366
02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I bet they're like lobsters and a lot of other bugs when they snap off a wing or</v>

5367
02:30:55.551 --> 02:30:56.121
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

5368
02:30:56.121 --> 02:30:57.170
<v Speaker 4>They just grow it back.</v>

5369
02:30:57.980 --> 02:30:58.813
<v Speaker 4>You took this photo?</v>

5370
02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:00.081
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5371
02:31:00.081 --> 02:31:02.390
<v Speaker 4>That was the praying mantises in my yard.</v>

5372
02:31:02.391 --> 02:31:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Here's is like Brown.</v>

5373
02:31:03.620 --> 02:31:05.060
<v Speaker 4>That one was like on vacation.</v>

5374
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:05.940
<v Speaker 4>Well I think he was.</v>

5375
02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I think he was being camouflage or they can change color?</v>

5376
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:12.583
<v Speaker 4>I'd think so.</v>

5377
02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

5378
02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:14.091
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

5379
02:31:14.091 --> 02:31:14.661
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

5380
02:31:14.661 --> 02:31:14.991
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5381
02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:16.160
<v Speaker 4>Can mantas camouflage.</v>

5382
02:31:16.161 --> 02:31:16.994
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

5383
02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:20.273
<v Speaker 4>That'd be cool.</v>

5384
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:21.330
<v Speaker 12>Yup,</v>

5385
02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:22.163
<v Speaker 12>they can.</v>

5386
02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5387
02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:24.050
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

5388
02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5389
02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Defense and camouflage.</v>

5390
02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:26.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5391
02:31:26.721 --> 02:31:27.980
<v Speaker 1>so that's what that thing was doing.</v>

5392
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:31.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what the thing was doing in my yard.</v>

5393
02:31:31.161 --> 02:31:31.821
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it,</v>

5394
02:31:31.821 --> 02:31:33.050
<v Speaker 1>it's on that stone ball,</v>

5395
02:31:33.051 --> 02:31:37.100
<v Speaker 1>which is the top of a fountain and it's it blended in to the exact same color.</v>

5396
02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:37.751
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5397
02:31:37.751 --> 02:31:38.920
<v Speaker 4>That is so cool.</v>

5398
02:31:39.130 --> 02:31:39.963
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5399
02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:41.633
<v Speaker 12>Pretty Weird.</v>

5400
02:31:42.210 --> 02:31:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Praying mantis can camouflage perfectly into environment of sticks,</v>

5401
02:31:45.451 --> 02:31:45.901
<v Speaker 1>barks,</v>

5402
02:31:45.901 --> 02:31:47.070
<v Speaker 1>leaves and flowers.</v>

5403
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:49.320
<v Speaker 1>The mantas is almost four inches long,</v>

5404
02:31:49.370 --> 02:31:49.580
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5405
02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:49.771
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5406
02:31:49.771 --> 02:31:50.041
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5407
02:31:50.041 --> 02:31:50.221
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5408
02:31:50.221 --> 02:31:50.461
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5409
02:31:50.461 --> 02:31:50.611
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5410
02:31:50.611 --> 02:31:51.321
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

5411
02:31:51.321 --> 02:31:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Mom,</v>

5412
02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:56.620
<v Speaker 4>the most evil looking one would be a red one if it camouflage on the like,</v>

5413
02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:57.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5414
02:31:57.291 --> 02:31:58.124
<v Speaker 4>something red.</v>

5415
02:31:58.690 --> 02:32:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It can be crazy eyes.</v>

5416
02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>They can be green,</v>

5417
02:32:01.211 --> 02:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>

5418
02:32:01.810 --> 02:32:04.450
<v Speaker 1>or a combination of colors to match their environment.</v>

5419
02:32:05.050 --> 02:32:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It will mold every few weeks and then can take on the colors of its natural</v>

5420
02:32:10.001 --> 02:32:10.840
<v Speaker 1>surroundings.</v>

5421
02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:11.733
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5422
02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:16.120
<v Speaker 1>A praying mantis might even mimic the charred remains of sticks.</v>

5423
02:32:16.121 --> 02:32:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Weeds or grass after a fire.</v>

5424
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:19.663
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5425
02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5426
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:21.451
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

5427
02:32:21.451 --> 02:32:22.284
<v Speaker 4>Started</v>

5428
02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:28.400
<v Speaker 4>swaying repetitively from side to side as a common California</v>

5429
02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:28.910
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

5430
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:32.720
<v Speaker 1>The praying mantis might be used to mimic the swing movement of vegetation in</v>

5431
02:32:32.721 --> 02:32:33.554
<v Speaker 1>the wind.</v>

5432
02:32:33.780 --> 02:32:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5433
02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:36.480
<v Speaker 4>Where was that?</v>

5434
02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:37.950
<v Speaker 4>This is a video you posted about.</v>

5435
02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5436
02:32:39.561 --> 02:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>That was his gangster praying mantis at the comments.</v>

5437
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:48.271
<v Speaker 13>Wait a minute.</v>

5438
02:32:48.271 --> 02:32:48.830
<v Speaker 13>What's this?</v>

5439
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.910
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

5440
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:49.743
<v Speaker 13>this is that.</v>

5441
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:53.100
<v Speaker 13>The parasite Geicos a Zombie praying man.</v>

5442
02:32:53.101 --> 02:32:55.980
<v Speaker 13>It's revealing a huge parasite living inside of it was,</v>

5504
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:32.170
<v Speaker 13>it actually takes over the mind to the grasshopper and gets the grasshopper to</v>

<v Speaker 4>A lot of pictures of frogs and them being friends.</v>

5596
02:36:54.350 --> 02:36:58.580
<v Speaker 4>That is a gangster bug but I kind of liked it to translate jacked it cause that</v>

5597
02:36:58.581 --> 02:37:03.581
<v Speaker 4>was a battle to the death and torrential one tranche will reverse position and</v>

5598
02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:05.970
<v Speaker 4>sunk those teeth in it.</v>

5599
02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if in nature though who would have won cause it's camouflaged.</v>

5600
02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:19.820
<v Speaker 4>They broke one of the man as his legs.</v>

5610
02:37:20.991 --> 02:37:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if the praying mantis would go after something as big as a trench a lot</v>

5611
02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:25.880
<v Speaker 4>in the wild.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5613
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:29.510
<v Speaker 4>It seems like they're just so evil to go after anything that's in front of them.</v>

5614
02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:31.520
<v Speaker 4>The fucking things are attacking birds.</v>

5619
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:42.770
<v Speaker 4>They go off to cats like every animal has an another animal they run from.</v>

5642
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:17.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like you fighting like a giant elephant,</v>

5643
02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:20.120
<v Speaker 4>like a semi truck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

5878
02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

5879
02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:37.391
<v Speaker 4>It's a lobster.</v>

5880
02:44:37.391 --> 02:44:41.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like a land lobster that's bigger obviously.</v>

5881
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5882
02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:43.330
<v Speaker 4>So that's must be the biggest,</v>

5883
02:44:43.470 --> 02:44:46.860
<v Speaker 7>but that that has like more than isn't eight legs are more considered like an</v>

5884
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:49.800
<v Speaker 7>insect is six.</v>

5885
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5886
02:44:50.601 --> 02:44:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

5887
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Is that how it works in sac?</v>

5888
02:44:52.461 --> 02:44:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Sac being six.</v>

5889
02:44:53.391 --> 02:44:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5890
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.823
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

5891
02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5892
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Like Arachnid is spider</v>

5893
02:44:59.590 --> 02:45:00.260
<v Speaker 4>right away?</v>

5894
02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:01.610
<v Speaker 4>This is Nikki stuff's new CD.</v>

02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:07.830

5912
02:45:24.191 --> 02:45:25.410
<v Speaker 1>You probably met you in</v>

5913
02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:30.050
<v Speaker 7>parking lot of the comedy store in 2002,</v>

5914
02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:30.960
<v Speaker 4>three and you were a,</v>

5915
02:45:30.961 --> 02:45:31.910
<v Speaker 4>you wish to work there.</v>

5916
02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5917
02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:34.040
<v Speaker 4>He did the whole stint like Ari,</v>

5918
02:45:34.041 --> 02:45:34.780
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of guys.</v>

5919
02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:35.210
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

5920
02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:37.070
<v Speaker 7>that's how I met Ari Dunkin.</v>

5921
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:38.001
<v Speaker 7>I worked the phones.</v>

5922
02:45:38.001 --> 02:45:38.990
<v Speaker 7>He was the talent coordinator.</v>

5923
02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin did the full stint.</v>

5924
02:45:41.450 --> 02:45:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a good stint for comics.</v>

5925
02:45:43.850 --> 02:45:46.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the one place where comic can get a job.</v>

5926
02:45:46.430 --> 02:45:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Like doing comedy,</v>

5927
02:45:47.271 --> 02:45:50.510
<v Speaker 1>being surrounded by degenerates on a constant basis and eventually become a</v>

5928
02:45:50.511 --> 02:45:53.240
<v Speaker 1>professional comedian to have his own comedy CD.</v>

5929
02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:53.961
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5930
02:45:53.961 --> 02:45:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5931
02:45:54.470 --> 02:45:55.580

02:45:55.581 --> 02:45:56.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5933
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I love watching guys come up in,</v>

5934
02:45:58.310 --> 02:45:59.180
<v Speaker 1>in La.</v>

5935
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5936
02:45:59.750 --> 02:46:02.270
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the few places where you'd see guys come up.</v>

5937
02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is starting to do the comedy store again.</v>

5938
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:05.383
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

5939
02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:08.020
<v Speaker 1>That's strange dilemma that,</v>

5940
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5941
02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:10.130
<v Speaker 1>since Tommy has</v>

5942
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:15.130
<v Speaker 2>decided to part ways with the comedy serve on to the next stage of a existence.</v>

5943
02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Suicide did a great ice house chronicles Friday,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hannibal Buress.</v>

5947
02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody came in because everyone wanted to talk about it.</v>

5948
02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5949
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wanted to talk about how ridiculous Tommy was.</v>

5950
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5951
02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:32.710

5954
02:46:35.290 --> 02:46:35.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5955
02:46:35.591 --> 02:46:40.090
<v Speaker 2>everyone kind of had somewhat defended him as being,</v>

5956
02:46:40.091 --> 02:46:40.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5957
02:46:40.391 --> 02:46:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like this mysterious person and it's probably going to be the end of that part</v>

5958
02:46:43.931 --> 02:46:45.340
<v Speaker 2>of the grocery store where it's like,</v>

5959
02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:45.911
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5960
02:46:45.911 --> 02:46:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it's haunted and Oh,</v>

5961
02:46:47.141 --> 02:46:47.974
<v Speaker 2>Mitzi.</v>

5962
02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:48.371
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5968
02:46:50.770 --> 02:46:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I showed a couple of the videos that I've made and I think that kind of silence</v>

5969
02:46:55.541 --> 02:46:55.841
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

5970

5975
02:46:59.890 --> 02:47:04.890
<v Speaker 1>deal though to take that job and to try to keep up the legacy of that famed</v>

5976
02:47:06.221 --> 02:47:07.900
<v Speaker 1>institution of insanity.</v>

5977
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be a little crazy.</v>

5978
02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else wants that job.</v>

5979
02:47:10.930 --> 02:47:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else would have done that job.</v>

5980
02:47:12.610 --> 02:47:16.000
<v Speaker 1>They would have turned it into some sort of a corporate whatever,</v>

5981
02:47:16.001 --> 02:47:16.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5982
02:47:16.241 --> 02:47:17.051
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank.</v>

5983
02:47:17.051 --> 02:47:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Sugar Shack.</v>

5984
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Chuckle hut.</v>

5985
02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:19.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

02:47:19.121 --> 02:47:19.900
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

5987
02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:20.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

5988
02:47:20.401 --> 02:47:24.160
<v Speaker 1>it could have easily been something that it isn't what it is is a very,</v>

5989
02:47:24.161 --> 02:47:27.340
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre place as far as comedy clubs go.</v>

5990
02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:31.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the most bizarre places of all time and one of the most historical comedy</v>

5991
02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:33.700
<v Speaker 1>clubs ever in the world.</v>

5992
02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

5993
02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:34.651
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

5994
02:47:34.651 --> 02:47:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The Art of standup comedy,</v>

5995
02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:39.730
<v Speaker 1>how many historical comedy clubs rival the comedy store?</v>

5996
02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Very few because it's in the same location.</v>

5997
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5998
02:47:42.971 --> 02:47:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you have like a few other ones.</v>

5999
02:47:44.591 --> 02:47:45.401
<v Speaker 1>Like the Ice House,</v>

6000
02:47:45.401 --> 02:47:46.234
<v Speaker 1>it's older,</v>

6001
02:47:46.390 --> 02:47:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you have um,</v>

6002
02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:48.670
<v Speaker 1>comedy magic club,</v>

6003
02:47:48.671 --> 02:47:49.241
<v Speaker 1>which is older,</v>

6004
02:47:49.241 --> 02:47:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the laugh factory,</v>

6005
02:47:50.081 --> 02:47:51.670
<v Speaker 1>which has a lot of historical significance.</v>

6006
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:53.950
<v Speaker 1>But laugh factory is not the same.</v>

6007
02:47:54.250 --> 02:47:55.990
<v Speaker 1>The laugh factory is not just,</v>

6008
02:47:56.050 --> 02:47:56.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a good club.</v>

6009
02:47:56.891 --> 02:47:57.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a great club to work at.</v>

6010
02:47:57.881 --> 02:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like,</v>

6011
02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:01.660
<v Speaker 1>like a place where when you're there you're like,</v>

6012
02:48:01.661 --> 02:48:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

6013
02:48:02.531 --> 02:48:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that goddamn comedy show.</v>

6014
02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:04.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6015
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:09.630
<v Speaker 1>that was the Mecca because the store like pre produced comics with the ice house</v>

6016
02:48:09.971 --> 02:48:11.980
<v Speaker 1>and the other ones just have had them come through.</v>

6017
02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:12.591
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6018
02:48:12.591 --> 02:48:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6019
02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:13.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6020
02:48:13.361 --> 02:48:13.840
<v Speaker 1>The stores,</v>

6021
02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the one of the only places that produced comics all because of Mitzi.</v>

6022
02:48:17.260 --> 02:48:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6023
02:48:17.770 --> 02:48:18.830
<v Speaker 1>You know that lady,</v>

6024
02:48:19.390 --> 02:48:20.860
<v Speaker 1>she helped a lot of Comedians,</v>

6025
02:48:20.861 --> 02:48:21.694
<v Speaker 1>me included.</v>

6026
02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6027
02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:24.220
<v Speaker 1>She helped a lot of comedians.</v>

6028
02:48:24.350 --> 02:48:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I think if they just keep the open mics as strong as it is there.</v>

6029
02:48:28.221 --> 02:48:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Sundays and Mondays there,</v>

6030
02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:31.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6031
02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:31.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6032
02:48:31.410 --> 02:48:33.800
<v Speaker 2>they have a really good open Mike Program Killed Tony.</v>

6033
02:48:33.801 --> 02:48:34.880
<v Speaker 2>On top of that is,</v>

6034
02:48:34.881 --> 02:48:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6035
02:48:35.210 --> 02:48:36.043
<v Speaker 2>really good for them.</v>

6036
02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that you'll still be able to make new comics there and it was still be a</v>

6037
02:48:40.401 --> 02:48:42.950
<v Speaker 2>good place for hiring Starbucks employees,</v>

6038
02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:45.410
<v Speaker 2>letting them kind of graduate through the system.</v>

6039
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6040
02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And now that,</v>

6041
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:47.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6042
02:48:47.031 --> 02:48:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you remove some of the crazy aspect as far as like the real negative crazy.</v>

6043
02:48:51.250 --> 02:48:56.250
<v Speaker 1>There was just too much ego and madness and just too much intolerable madness is</v>

6044
02:48:57.010 --> 02:48:57.210
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

6045
02:48:57.210 --> 02:48:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The best way to describe it.</v>

6046
02:48:58.371 --> 02:49:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not dealing with rational people.</v>

6047
02:49:00.561 --> 02:49:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with someone who's intolerably crazy and it's not that the whole</v>

6048
02:49:03.861 --> 02:49:06.380
<v Speaker 1>intolerable crew is removed.</v>

6049
02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:09.270
<v Speaker 1>There's still some in co intolerable behind the scenes folks,</v>

6050
02:49:10.050 --> 02:49:11.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's way better now.</v>

6051
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It's at least gotten 50% better.</v>

6052
02:49:12.450 --> 02:49:15.780
<v Speaker 7>And that other group you never see ever,</v>

6053
02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:16.740
<v Speaker 7>ever,</v>

6054
02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:17.610
<v Speaker 7>ever there.</v>

6055
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:18.300
<v Speaker 7>So it's,</v>

6056
02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:19.050
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter.</v>

6057
02:49:19.050 --> 02:49:19.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6058
02:49:19.650 --> 02:49:22.670
<v Speaker 7>And you could also go on line to see what we're in when they're out of town and</v>

6059
02:49:22.671 --> 02:49:26.280
<v Speaker 7>it's got to that stage that's makes you seem like a stalker.</v>

6060
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:27.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6061
02:49:27.071 --> 02:49:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I love the Improv man.</v>

6062
02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I did one thing to change my act quite a bit is when I left the store and I</v>

6063
02:49:33.251 --> 02:49:34.240
<v Speaker 1>started doing the Improv,</v>

6064
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I found audiences that aren't heckling,</v>

6065
02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:39.310
<v Speaker 1>they're not like constantly heckling.</v>

6066
02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:40.780
<v Speaker 1>They have actually have crowd control.</v>

6067
02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:41.921
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

6068
02:49:41.921 --> 02:49:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and then I also noticed that they have two shows a night.</v>

6069
02:49:43.991 --> 02:49:45.490
<v Speaker 1>They'll do an eight o'clock show on 10 o'clock show,</v>

6070
02:49:45.491 --> 02:49:48.400
<v Speaker 1>which is way better for like the audience's attention span.</v>

6071
02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And it made me realize like the con,</v>

6072
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store's like lifting weights with like a weight vest on,</v>

6073
02:49:54.101 --> 02:49:54.940
<v Speaker 1>running up a hill.</v>

6074
02:49:55.210 --> 02:49:57.160
<v Speaker 1>You know when you get to that place,</v>

6075
02:49:57.161 --> 02:50:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about that is you go anywhere else and you're fucking golden.</v>

6076
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6077
02:50:01.210 --> 02:50:05.590
<v Speaker 1>The regular audiences will be so much easier than the audiences that you deal</v>

6078
02:50:05.591 --> 02:50:06.640
<v Speaker 1>with on a weekly basis.</v>

6079
02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.290
<v Speaker 7>The store,</v>

6080
02:50:07.290 --> 02:50:07.800
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

6081
02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:10.440
<v Speaker 7>Growing up like after 12 comics,</v>

6082
02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:14.400
<v Speaker 7>five six of them are just like crushing crowds drunk.</v>

6083
02:50:14.401 --> 02:50:15.870
<v Speaker 7>They'd been there for three hours</v>

6084
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and if anything topical happens by the time you get up on stage,</v>

6085
02:50:19.541 --> 02:50:21.580
<v Speaker 1>it's been discussed 50 fucking times.</v>

6086
02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:23.190
<v Speaker 1>There was a onetime,</v>

6087
02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:26.560
<v Speaker 1>when Ari was working there and the Chinese,</v>

6088
02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:31.510
<v Speaker 1>a fighter pilot crashed with an American fighter jet and the guy's name was Wong</v>

6089
02:50:31.511 --> 02:50:32.344
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

6090
02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:33.340
<v Speaker 1>That was his name.</v>

6091
02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:35.170
<v Speaker 1>W.</v>

6092
02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:35.170
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>

6093
02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:35.170
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

6094
02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:35.170
<v Speaker 1>G.</v>

6095
02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Weei.</v>

6096
02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Everybody do a joke on it.</v>

6097
02:50:36.911 --> 02:50:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw anybody else's sat.</v>

6098
02:50:38.471 --> 02:50:40.390
<v Speaker 1>But everybody came in and did a walk.</v>

6099
02:50:40.470 --> 02:50:43.120
<v Speaker 1>One way is this real life long way,</v>

6100
02:50:43.121 --> 02:50:46.450
<v Speaker 1>do you know the guy's name was Wong Way and at a certain point in time the</v>

6101
02:50:46.451 --> 02:50:46.871
<v Speaker 1>audience is like,</v>

6102
02:50:46.871 --> 02:50:47.980
<v Speaker 1>are we being trolled?</v>

6103
02:50:47.981 --> 02:50:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Is this like an inside joke.</v>

6104
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:53.010
<v Speaker 1>They not know that everybody before them has done a long way joke.</v>

6105
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:53.903
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

6106
02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:58.440
<v Speaker 7>Even Crowdwork sometimes if you go up like where are you from and someone else</v>

6107
02:50:58.441 --> 02:51:00.210
<v Speaker 7>will answer like ice from Lancaster.</v>

6108
02:51:00.270 --> 02:51:00.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6109
02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:04.020
<v Speaker 7>Fuck did you know cause he's been asked 10 times.</v>

6110
02:51:04.610 --> 02:51:07.980
<v Speaker 7>I love the fact that this happened because it seems like a lot of comics are</v>

6111
02:51:07.981 --> 02:51:10.620
<v Speaker 7>coming back to this place that didn't really want it when it come to it.</v>

6112
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.951
<v Speaker 7>By the way,</v>

6133
02:51:40.411 --> 02:51:40.651

6140
02:51:47.981 --> 02:51:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I made a joke about something and I really didn't mean it.</v>

6141
02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6146
02:51:59.821 --> 02:52:00.571
<v Speaker 1>they might not take it.</v>

6167
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:30.070

6178
02:52:44.170 --> 02:52:46.600

02:52:46.881 --> 02:52:50.690
<v Speaker 7>David spade was there yesterday or did he stand up again?</v>

6181
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:51.420
<v Speaker 7>I guess that was,</v>

6182
02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:52.010
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

6183
02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:52.843
<v Speaker 7>How was it?</v>

6184
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.601
<v Speaker 7>It was all right.</v>

6185
02:52:53.601 --> 02:52:54.980
<v Speaker 7>He was working on a couple of new bits.</v>

6186
02:52:54.981 --> 02:52:55.071
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

02:52:55.071 --> 02:52:56.270
<v Speaker 7>Like notes up there with them.</v>

6188
02:52:56.271 --> 02:52:56.860
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

6189
02:52:56.860 --> 02:52:57.410
<v Speaker 7>but the kid,</v>

6190
02:52:57.410 --> 02:53:00.620
<v Speaker 7>some funny stuff about like going skiing for the first time.</v>

6191
02:53:00.621 --> 02:53:04.790
<v Speaker 7>He had like a story on that and all the names of all the slopes were like these</v>

6192
02:53:04.791 --> 02:53:07.740
<v Speaker 7>like horrifying like evil names.</v>

6193
02:53:07.741 --> 02:53:09.580
<v Speaker 7>You're like Hitler's abortion was the one of them.</v>

6194
02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:10.221
<v Speaker 7>Just stuff like that.</v>

6195
02:53:10.221 --> 02:53:11.180
<v Speaker 7>It was really funny.</v>

6196
02:53:11.690 --> 02:53:14.090
<v Speaker 7>But you could tell he was like developing it and it's like,</v>

6197
02:53:14.570 --> 02:53:17.660
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting to see him when I would lie to stand up live.</v>

6198
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:18.001
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6199
02:53:18.001 --> 02:53:22.110
<v Speaker 4>he probably like took some time off doing a lot of TV and shit.</v>

6200
02:53:22.111 --> 02:53:23.340
<v Speaker 4>And then while those guys,</v>

6201
02:53:23.341 --> 02:53:24.300
<v Speaker 4>they lose their chops,</v>
