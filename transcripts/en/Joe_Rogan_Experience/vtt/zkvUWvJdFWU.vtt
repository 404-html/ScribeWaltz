WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.010
Ready?
Um,
four,
three,
two,

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.620
one,
boom.
And we're live.
You would just tell me,

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.660
you would just tell me how you son is getting into Bruce Lee because we were

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:17.640
looking at this,
uh,
shout out to,
uh,
how do you pronounce his name correctly?

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.210
Bruce Lee?
No,
play the plastic cell.
The plastic cell.
Dude,

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.000
I only seen it written and you have to to actually made it,

7
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.520
but yet plastic sell I believe is the name.
But I mean,

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.150
how do you pronounce the artist's name?
I think was the Phong Tran.
Yeah.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.660
Shout out to phone.
This thing is the shit.
His art is amazing.

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
These little plastic cell things like Rory Macdonald.

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.030
How great is at the whole lineups?
Amazing.
Yeah.
I mean those are sunglasses,

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
which I'm off.
Nothing but legend today.
But yeah,
I wanted,
how old's your son now?

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.970
He's six now.
And
you hear these stories.

14
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.170
I'm constantly about people remembering the first time they saw Bruce Lee movie.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.990
It's so epic.
I'll never forget my dad took me to the theater,

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.500
blew my mind.
Everyone's got a story.
Joe,

17
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.060
he's got his first time he saw Bruce Lee.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
So I wanted to make sure I didn't do that too early because then he would
forget,

19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.501
you know,

20
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:14.550
cause he forgets special last moments we had together from like three years ago.

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.690
I'm like,
I don't remember that,
you know,
cause he's the only five,
right,
man,

22
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.090
he's six [inaudible] six six.

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.740
Imagine how quick your brain is growing and the amount of money,

24
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:26.310
you forgot a lot of shit,
you know.
But anyways,
uh,

25
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:30.270
so I thought maybe I'm going to hit him with the,
I'm going to sit them down and,

26
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.350
and,
and put on,
enter the dragon and blow his fucking mind.

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.830
But I don't want to do a tour.
Like,
when do I do it?

28
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.620
I'm thinking maybe I could even wait till these 10 or eight or whatever,

29
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.350
you know?
But he's been doing karate since he was three,

30
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.190
so about three years now he's been doing karate and he took a nun,

31
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.980
chuck workshop class that they had.
So he's got his little,
you know,

32
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.090
those padded nun chucks.
He fucking loves those things,
man.
And I thought,
shit,

33
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:55.590
he's getting into the nun chucks.

34
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.670
It might be a time to drop Bruce Lee on his ass.

35
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
You know what I mean?
I don't want them to get twisted,
you know what I mean?

36
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.780
Cause he starts,
he starts talking about Jackie Chan and shit like that.

37
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.950
And I'm like,
Oh,

38
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:11.120
I guess you seen anybody do it on video or only learned it from a glisten.

39
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.130
This is what happened.
So He's,
he's all Linden and Chuck's,

40
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:18.120
he's beaten me up with them all the time.
He loves nunchucks and I,
and I said,
Oh,

41
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.110
then I wore one of those routes of fights shirts and it was Bruce Lee with lunch

42
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.700
looks right.
And he looked at my shirt and he said,
Daddy,

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.440
who's the guy with the nunchucks?
And I thought,
okay,
it's time.

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.960
It's time,
son.
Sit down.
So you know,

45
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.100
kids are so easily brainwashed.

46
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.670
I can get my kid into satanism.
We've seen this little kid.
Yeah,
yeah.

47
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:48.120
He's amazing.
He's amazing.
He's got the Bruce Lee outfit,
I everything,

48
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:52.670
the jumpsuit,
this is amazing.
And he's got,
he's got,
uh,

49
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.820
the game of death sequence down.
It says the video is my son.

50
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.520
And in parentheses,
a five year acting.

51
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:05.410
Bruce Lee's nunchucks a scene.
Yeah,
he ran acts,
the whole thing.

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.010
No for not.
I think he was on like America's got talent or some shit too.

53
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.250
So I sat him down and I,
and I explained to him,

54
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.990
I go the master of the nun chucks the number one guy,
you know,

55
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.870
cause like,
like I was like I was saying earlier,

56
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.690
you could get kids to believe in anything.
You get brain.
I could,

57
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.580
I could get my son into Satan easily.
He'd be all in all about Lucifer.
Boom.

58
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.650
I got them under the Brown twigs.
Yeah.
Little kids.
Yeah,
totally.

59
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.920
He's,
he's so into the Dodgers because his grandpa is under the daughter,

60
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:40.780
so he's all about the Dodgers and I got them into the browns is all in the

61
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.630
Brown's not too because then I could get them into anything.
Right.

62
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.340
So I sat them down and I say,
you are,

63
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.570
but I'm going to sit you down and I'm going to show you the master of the

64
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.830
nunchucks in it's Bruce Lee.
He's number one dude.

65
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.383
He's the guy,

66
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.830
he's the greatest martial artist of all time.

67
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.570
I broke him and I sat him down and put them in front of the TV to that.

68
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.210
You should have filmed this.
I did you fill the whole thing?

69
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.290
He filmed you saying it to him?
No,
I didn't film that,
but I filmed it.

70
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.980
I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.
Um,
uh,

71
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.330
first I showed them the greatest nunchuck scenes of all time with Bruce Lee that

72
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.240
you can go to youtube and you can get,
there's compilations.

73
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.830
They put together the one from the stuff in enter the dragon and the stuff in a

74
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.870
Chinese connection,
uh,
uh,
way of the dragon or,
or return of the Dragon.

75
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.650
And uh,
so I sat them down and go,
I'm going to blitz them with this shit.

76
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.300
I'm going to make sure that whenever he thinks about fucking nunchucks he knows

77
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.600
that Bruce Lee's the master.
Right.
So he's just completely blown away.

78
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.790
Then after I showed him all the nunchucks scenes,

79
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.420
I sat them down and I wanted to show him the greatest fights of all time.

80
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.870
Bruce leave versus Chuck fucking Norris come on that.

81
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.400
So I just want her to leave that just in his DNA.
And I filmed that.

82
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.490
I filmed him watching,
uh,
Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee.

83
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.300
And he always wants to know he,
he loves,

84
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.190
he loves Bruce Lee instantly and he,
he,
he needs to know who wins the fight.

85
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.610
So it's like daddy does Bruce Lee when I go,
he always,

86
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:16.290
when sunny always wins and,
but my natural reaction,
cause he,

87
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.450
he's constantly asking questions.
He's constantly does.
He went,

88
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.430
my natural reaction would be just watch,

89
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.430
watch you gotta watch this because it's going to be sweeter if you watch it and

90
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.820
you go through the ups and downs.
And he goes,
no,
Daddy,
you need to tell me now.

91
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.880
And I go,
no,
you're going to like it more if you just watch it.

92
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.970
You got to know daddy does Bruce Lee when he wants to fucking know he going to

93
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.900
be disappointed.
Yeah.
So he got two years old.
Yeah.
He got completely blown away.

94
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:44.260
So a week later,
a week later I got today,

95
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.700
you're going to watch the greatest martial arts movie of all time and or the

96
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:52.380
dragon.
Cause it's Bruce Lee.
Dad,
isn't it?
I go,
yes,
it's

97
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.240
so we sat him down.
We put on for any,

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.050
can't stop asking fucking questions about every God.

99
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.670
Okay Daddy,
who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?

100
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.750
Is he a bad guy or is he a good guy?
So we got it down to three main good guys.

101
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.280
You know,
Bruce Lee is the main good guy.
Uh,
Williams.
I was um,

102
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.820
uh,
goddammit.
His name escapes me.

103
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.590
The black famous martial artists.
Jim Kelly,
Jim Keltner.
Wow.
I forgot about Jim.

104
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.880
Jim Kelly's awesome.
And uh,
he did die in the movie,

105
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.310
which I mean they were doing that shit back then.
You know what I mean?

106
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.580
A good guy.
And then roper,
John Saxon,
he was the third.
Good God.

107
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.070
Yes,
it was Roper Williams and Bruce Lee.
And they were all,

108
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.030
they were the good guys and the bad guys.
Do you remember the bad guys' names?
No.

109
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.980
Han was the,
the,
the dude on the top left.
He's the,
he's the guy with the clause,

110
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:50.981
former Shaolin monk who when bad and started selling heroin on this island and,

111
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.420
and,
and,
and uh,
prostitution rings and all that Shit.

112
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.000
Completely forgot the plot of this movie.
Are you kidding me?

113
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.850
It's the greatest fucking plan.
I remember watching it,
but you know,

114
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.250
I didn't take it seriously.
I always thought it was fun.
I was,

115
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:09.170
I was looked at it and not like,
Holy Shit,

116
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.970
we're going to see this wild action movie.

117
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.850
I always thought of it is because by the time I watched it,

118
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.460
it was kind of campy mean.
I'm sure watching when I was a little kid,

119
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.010
you gotta don't remember.
Yeah.
You got to go back and watch the little thing.

120
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.280
Cause every wouldn't,
you know,
that's,
that's most people's common reaction.

121
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:26.320
Like you just remember,
you remember the scene with Han with the razor hand.

122
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.360
Remember he had to raise her hand.
He had a claw hand.

123
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.960
You remember Bolo young and they're fighting outside and the tournament,

124
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.280
you know,
you remember all that shit.
You remember?
Um,
uh,

125
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.320
Williams getting killed.
They hung them.
Uh,
your,

126
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.100
you remember Williams fighting,
Hon?

127
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.500
There's certain scenes everyone will remember and you've just,

128
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.210
you forget about the little scenes and the plot.
So I sit down to my son,

129
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.080
I sat down my son and we're watching this and my mom,
his mom's like,

130
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.080
it's appropriate for,
for a six year old,
right?
It's not going to get too crazy.

131
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.950
I go,
it's fine.
It's just a bunch of karate.
No,
it's fine.

132
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.500
So she's all like,
oh.

133
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.790
So we're sitting there and he can't stop asking God damn questions.

134
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.230
He can't stop asking God to him questions.
The bad guys are Hahn's the main guy,

135
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.600
oh,
Hora Bob Wall.
Remember him?

136
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.570
Everybody remembers he had a scar on his face and they,

137
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.690
everyone remembers that he was,

138
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.780
him and his gang were chasing Bruce Lee sister in the movie and they cornered

139
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.310
her and she had to kill herself.

140
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:30.800
She just killed herself before they could like rape or whatever.

141
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.710
People are what people remember that that's a another classic scene.

142
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.180
But you don't remember.
You don't think about all the shit in between man.

143
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.050
Cause the plot,

144
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.700
the plot of the story is Han lives on an island and he has,

145
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.350
he does a lot of illegal shit.

146
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:50.150
He runs a heroin and prostitution through his island,

147
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:51.800
right.
And,
um,

148
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.070
he has a tournament like once a year and he invites all the greatest martial

149
00:08:56.071 --> 00:09:00.390
artists,
um,
on earth and he tries to recruit them.

150
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.480
He sits them all down and he,
and he shows them his,
uh,

151
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.870
like underground operation going on,
you know what I mean?

152
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.700
So he tried to Tom Roper into it.

153
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.840
He tried to talk Williams into an era and a roper almost went for it cause he

154
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:16.350
was a kind of,
he's a good guy,
but he was like a Gambler,
you know what I mean?

155
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.920
He's kind of shady,
but at the end he's like,
fuck this,
I'm going to do this shit.

156
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.660
So that's what he doesn't,
and he called him Bruce Lee to,
uh,

157
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.350
and he was going to try to recruit Bruce Lee,

158
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.500
but the CIA got ahold of Bruce Lee first.

159
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.100
Yes.
Seriously.

160
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.150
So they get ahold of Bruce Lee and they sit them down in a dark room and they're

161
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.160
playing a projector and they're showing,
you know,
uh,

162
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.710
they want Bruce Lee to go in there undercover to uncover all the,
um,

163
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.420
uh,
the,
the,
the crime and all this stuff that was going on.

164
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.440
Selling drugs.
Yes.
Drugs and prostitution and um,

165
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.770
and doing mind control on a,
so what,

166
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:01.410
so I'm sitting there and watching it and he wants to know who the bad guys are.

167
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.400
Bolo Bolo is a bad guy.
O'Hara who's Bob Wall's a bad guy.
And then Hans,

168
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:08.850
the main bad guy.
So he's constantly ask some questions and then boom,

169
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:13.590
you forget about the scenes were um,
uh,
Han would,

170
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.760
has like a madam and he's got all these hookers and there's a hooker seen you

171
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:18.840
forget about the hooker scene.

172
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.100
They send like five girls to Williams who was a good guy in roper to try to

173
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.800
corrupt them,
you know what I mean?
And Boom,
as soon it,

174
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.730
they're all in their gowns and,
and in robes and Williams is like in our,

175
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:33.240
in a robe.
And I grabbed the remote and just started hitting fast forward.
And,
uh,

176
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.300
my son's a Lou,
what's going on here?
What's going on here,
dad?
Why you fast?

177
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:38.400
Where I'm glad nothing's going on.
What are they doing?

178
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.570
They're getting ready to go to sleep.
Just forget about that same boom.

179
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:46.050
And you forget that there's a,
is this the same?

180
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.160
There it is right there and there's titties and everything,
but um,

181
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.320
yeah,
he got,
he was blown away and a mission accomplished.
He's,

182
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.250
he's Bruce Lee's number one in,
uh,
to him and,

183
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.280
but I made a mistake the next week and I made them sit down and watch return of

184
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:08.520
the dragon,

185
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.540
which the end seeing was a great scene with Chuck Norris and the old Rome

186
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.710
Colosseum.
But the whole movie before that is so bad.

187
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.740
It's so bad.

188
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.190
And Bruce Lee directed it and uh,

189
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:27.060
and wrote it and it was,
uh,
it's atrocious.

190
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.330
It's so bad
except for the chuck.

191
00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:33.600
So together except for the end,

192
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.130
but it's like high school kids put together that terror.

193
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:39.750
I going to have to go back a while.
We know we should do,

194
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:41.400
we should do a fight companion

195
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.100
and watch enter the dragon.
That would be fucking great dude.
Are you kidding?

196
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.550
Come on man.
Fight companion and watch this.
Look at this scene.

197
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.950
So there it's takes place in Italy.
His

198
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.190
<v 1>uh,
one of his like think his uncle or just,</v>

199
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.940
or just somebody he knows has a Chinese restaurant in Italy and the Italian mob.

200
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.920
These guys,
these are the goons.
They're trying to run them out of business and,

201
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.240
and uh,
control their business or pay Pam off to take the building or something.

202
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.580
And they're,
they're resisting in Italy.

203
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.880
So they send a Bruce Lee from Hong Kong to handle the mob to this.

204
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.690
It's so corny.
It's fucking bad.

205
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.780
So what do you think happened?
I think Bruce,
who's his partying too much,

206
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.570
doing a little blow,
having a good time out in the town,

207
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.020
being a big Hollywood star puts the of this movie and you just got a little

208
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:38.170
crazy with it.
You know what?
This is before he blew up though,

209
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.830
because he did this movie,
he did a big boss,

210
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:44.410
Chinese connection and this one was his third one.

211
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.010
And then after this is when Warner brothers came in and signed them.

212
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.410
That's when they did enter the dragon.
That was his last one.

213
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.880
Enter the dragon was uh,
had a,
had a budget,
this and that.
I'm really any budget.

214
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:58.690
This is a like just cheap Chinese production.
You know?

215
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.740
It's crazy when you think that there was really no one like him before him,

216
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.330
but there's Chuck Norris waiting,
waiting for him.
Thumbs down.

217
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.570
You know,
when you,
when you think about w there,

218
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.170
there was no kind of movies like this before.
This,
this fight scene.

219
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.940
Greatest fight scene,
worst movie.

220
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.390
How about the grab of the chest hair pulls a chunk of it out.

221
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.360
Oh Shit.
I got your chest hair,
bitch.

222
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.050
I mean it's,
it's funny watching it when no volume two because it's so corny.

223
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.910
It looks so fresh and it's all overdubbed and,
and it's,
it's God awful.
But dude,

224
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.710
his martial arts technique,

225
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.450
especially when you think about the fact that this was what,
1974,

226
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.250
that was like 71 71.
It was finally released in 76,

227
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:47.890
but he died in [inaudible] 73.
He had incredible technique,

228
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.720
like really good technique.
Like he's kicking technique especially for back then.

229
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.960
You know,
I think uh,
because of the youtube and shit,
there's,

230
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.680
there's so many guys out there that they're doing like,
um,

231
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.160
these jump spinning three wheel kicks.

232
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.720
There was some guy that more Winkle John Jackson had on his uh,

233
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.030
um,
the uh,
Instagram page and it's uh,

234
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.150
a Korean gentleman doing some fucking ridiculous shit.

235
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.480
Just like jumping 360 degree wheel kicks and like a series of them cartwheels

236
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:25.600
flying through the air and doing all these things.

237
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.840
Like none of this was ever in the movies before,
you know,

238
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:33.190
until like when like maybe gently I guess.
No on Bach.
Right.

239
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.160
Cause they're there a next level in terms of like athleticism.

240
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.180
I mean there's that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
I mean it's all like mystical,

241
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.650
magical show.
This guy is actually doing this.
This is just a video of him.

242
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.680
He starts out normal stores,
like a bunch of front kicks,

243
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:51.230
throws a bunch of sidekicks,
and then he starts doing jumping wheel kicks,

244
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.300
three 60 wheel kicks,
tornado kicks.

245
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:55.790
He's just fucking flying through the air and flipping through the air.

246
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.610
Aerial cartwheel kicks and you're like,
Whoa,

247
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.280
people can do shit now.
And they do stuff in like in martial arts films,

248
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.180
the techniques,
just way better.
They're just way back.
He just got better at it.

249
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.450
Can you put that,
that fight something the backup.
But Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris,

250
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.830
see if you could sign that video first while you're looking for w just while

251
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:16.240
we're come out with the one.
That's the one thing about Bruce Lee.

252
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.470
All the pads and he flies.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

253
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.650
It's just a guy throwing kicks in the air.
He's just throwing kicks in the air.

254
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.850
It's on,
uh,
the Jackson wink.
Yeah,
it's Jackson.
Winkeljohn.

255
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.500
I just looked at her Instagram page.
Oh,
this guy's doing it an MMA?
No,
no.

256
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:32.600
He's doing it in the air.
I just doing it in the air.

257
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.560
Which of their pages should I,
is he planning to use it in them?
May Top one.

258
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:41.030
Jackson wink,
MMA.
That one.
Check that one out.
There's a Korean dude.

259
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:44.030
If you keep going down,
I don't know if he's planning on using in MMA.

260
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.470
Oh my fuck is it?
God Damn it.

261
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:55.450
I didn't see anything.
Maybe they were commenting on it.

262
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.590
Fuck somebody had it up.
Sorry.
Anyway,

263
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.600
but with Bruce Lee fight scenes,

264
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.520
what I like about them is you could see him,

265
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.760
although you know him beating up 50 guys at a time,
you know,

266
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.890
you know how real can that be.
But he does one on one on one fights.

267
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.910
He does a lot of bank team.
He'll do boxing stuff,
he'll do wrestling,

268
00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:23.790
he'll do Jujitsu.
You see him mix it up and he's trying to make it,
uh,

269
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.520
a lot more realistic,
like the,
you know,

270
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.060
then you have your classic comfort with theater type movies where they just,

271
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.493
right.

272
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:40.150
You're like,
yeah,
that shit is just always a,
so Bruce Lee,

273
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.060
Bruce Lee,
we'll dance around,
he'll throw a jab fade,

274
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.300
kick you in the leg for fake low,
go high.
And knock you out.

275
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.800
He does that against the Chuck Norris.
Yeah.

276
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.620
In in a way or the dragon.
And if you go back to 1970,

277
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:58.180
like that kind of martial art technique and he was,
he was amazing.

278
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.320
He was also the first guy that figured out how to put a bunch of martial arts

279
00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:06.670
together and just forget about,
um,
judo,
your karate and forget about that.
Just,

280
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:10.960
just,
just use everything that works.
Everything from everywhere.

281
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.930
And that was heresy back then.
I mean,
he might've been,
um,
uh,

282
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.630
he may have been the first guy to do that.
Really?
I mean,

283
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.230
for sure one of them for sure.
Yeah.
He's without a doubt.

284
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.260
Like I think there's two arguably to the most important figures ever in martial

285
00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:33.820
arts.
I think he might be number one.
And the other one is Elio.
Gracie.

286
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.350
<v 1>You really think about it.</v>

288
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.360
It's one guy tries to figure out how to beat men who are bigger than him,

289
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:45.530
has a bunch of kids.
They all turn out to be fucking savage.
Killer.
Yeah.
I mean,

290
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:50.040
what are the odds?
Yes.
The craziest family of all time.
Craziest family of all

291
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.310
<v 3>time.
And if you think about it crazy in a good way.
Crazy.</v>

292
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:56.340
We're getting the best way possible with a hundred percent respect.

293
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.550
I mean Hixon hallways Heuler Helson you know what the fuck.

294
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:06.190
And then there's different sides.
The Gracies had,
uh,
you know,

295
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.790
conflict within each other.
Crazy.

296
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.430
A family of soup.
Then employees,
who's another,

297
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.630
I mean it's,
it's almost like hoist,
although it came from Eylea,

298
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.880
he's almost as important.

299
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.000
If he doesn't win that first ultimate fighting championship,

300
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.720
we though we don't get the same impact he has to win.

301
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.110
Imagine if he would've lost the first fight.
What if you've got a head kicked?

302
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.561
You know what?

303
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:34.320
If you got in there with some guy who's done this before and he gets head
kicked,

304
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.960
Patrick Smith could have fucked him up.
Fucked up.

305
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.840
That we could have been if the lineups were different.
That could,

306
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:40.674
are you kidding?

307
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.430
The hoist Gracie movie and it ends after UFC to ends.

308
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.450
The Patrick Smith,
that's the perfect ending right there.
Did he ever got,

309
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.410
he fought Patrick Smith didn't wait for boys fight.
He chose to come up,

310
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.620
choked him or her the second time they were in the UFC together?
No,

311
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.290
it was the first one.
Yeah,
no,

312
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.420
it was UFC two voice was on one side of the bracket.
Pat Smith,

313
00:19:04.421 --> 00:19:08.040
who's on the other side,
you know,
black,
uh,
you know,

314
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.320
killer Muy Thai guy.

315
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.610
Fucking like what he did to a Scott Morris Ninja guy.
Yeah,

316
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.210
dude,
man,
that's a movie.
That's a movie right there.

317
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.050
UFC Two with a goddamn movie.
Well,

318
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:27.051
Patrick Smith was a real legit top level kickboxer but he was a real dangerous

319
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.620
kickboxer you watch his striking.
I mean that guy was explosive,

320
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.050
super powerful and ruthless man.

321
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.930
What he got on top of that dude was elbowing him into oblivion.

322
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.340
Backlund they didn't know exactly when to stop a fight.

323
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.460
They weren't sure where to go.
John was like,
the guy is still alive.

324
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.480
Yeah.
Yeah.
But,
but the point is a hoist did when he didn't get kicked,

325
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.440
took the guys down,
choked him,
Allah.
And all of us were like,
what?

326
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.260
And then it's almost,
if you go to martial arts,

327
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:02.180
you look at like the whole history of martial arts and then you hit 1993 and it

328
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:04.320
goes like this.
Yeah.

329
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.100
It's like would be the craziest rise in the stock market.

330
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:10.230
You could ever say you'd have to investigate.
You have to be like,

331
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:14.370
what the fuck happened here?
Such an explosion.
It was UFC to u of C one.

332
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:16.380
No one really watched.
They didn't have any B roll.

333
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.180
I remember seeing a preview for it and I would watch all boxing events no matter

334
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:25.590
what.
It's a boxing fanatic.
I didn't miss any of those big fights ever.

335
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.860
Even the small Tuesday night fights,
I,
I recorded that on my VCR.

336
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.480
Always taped boxing events.
Never missed him,
but I didn't,
I didn't watch that.

337
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:36.390
I go,
you know what?
I thought it looks like it might be fake.

338
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.700
I thought maybe like a fight zone.

339
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:42.570
Remember fights are a little WWE,

340
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.890
but try to make it look,
uh,
you know,
more martial arts oriented.

341
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.650
But so I didn't watch it and then you end up,
you know,

342
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:53.890
you end up hearing shit that that was real.
And I'll never forget,

343
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.040
my roommate came home from Guitar Center and he said,
man,

344
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:01.420
that you have seat thing that UFC challenge.
That shit's for real man.

345
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.050
I don't really,
and I was doing karate at the time and I go,

346
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.230
was there a karate guy on there and goes yeah,
but he got beat by some,

347
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.940
I think he was Iranian man.
He was just choking everybody out.

348
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.170
He would just go,
he was choking everybody out.

349
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.990
What do you mean you would just grab the door?
Cause Dude,
yeah,

350
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.160
he would just grab the fucking throat,
some Iranian guy and he would choke.

351
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:24.090
He choked everybody out.
That's what the guy told me,
a guitar center.
I'm like,

352
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.210
Holy Shit,
karate too.
I'm like fuck,
maybe I'm doing the wrong style.

353
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.550
And then the UFC,
UFC two came out in,

354
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:36.670
I remember I told my same roommate,
he was staying home,

355
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:40.700
it was on the weekend and I was going out on the town and I remember calling

356
00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.610
them and say,
hey dude,
that UFC too,

357
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.420
that you have c challenge thing is on tape it because he was going to stay home

358
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:51.270
with his girlfriend.
He taped it.
I got home,
watched that motherfucker on tape.
I,

359
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.540
I couldn't stand hoists Gracie that first,
uh,
first half of the show,

360
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.200
I just wanted him to lose so bad when he fought MMA Gnocchi,
itchy horror.

361
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.540
There was a karate guy to me that was my hero.
I mean,

362
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:04.410
I was doing karate for six months,
man.
You know what I mean?

363
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.600
I was all about karate.
I didn't want hoist to beat him,
but then Ho,

364
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.250
but by the time we got to the finals,
I was a gigantic hoist fan.
I go,

365
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.840
you know what,
I got to learn this Jujitsu and I just quit karate and,
and um,

366
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.450
found,
uh,
the Machados in the valley.

367
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.530
It is really crazy when you think about what would have happened if that didn't

368
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:24.364
take place.

369
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.350
Like what would have happened if Horian never put together the,

370
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.790
the first ultimate fighter.
It was partly his idea and arc.
Davies.
Yeah.

371
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.480
What of what would happen if that didn't happen?
Where would martial arts be?

372
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.010
Would it be inevitable with somebody figured out with Japan and figured it out?

373
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.980
We would have figured it out eventually because maybe uh,
yeah,

374
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:47.830
cause the Jujitsu would eventually grew out of Brazil.

375
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.100
There's no way he could've stopped the looked the way it grew.
Yeah.

376
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.640
And that was a huge explosion,
but it have got out eventually,

377
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:58.900
but with maybe I'm for sure not with the same impact.
Yeah,

378
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:03.430
but see like forever wrestlers were like,

379
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.930
when you think about MMA right now,
wrestling's a giant scale,
right?

380
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.750
A Mark Coleman type wrestler.
Big powerful west.

381
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:12.940
We could take you down and beat you up from the top.
That's a giant.

382
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.970
That was always the case.
But we didn't think of that.

383
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.560
Like when you thought of like boxing versus wrestling or karate versus raffling.

384
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.200
Nobody thought,
look,
wrestlers have a giant advantage.

385
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.440
Nobody thought that you would think all the karate guy probably fuck him up.

386
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.470
Catch what a karate Chop Nisha on the way in or something like that.

387
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.410
I wrestled and I never thought wrestling was a martial art at all.

388
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.890
To me it was one on one football.
I had never looked at it but,

389
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.430
and I would use it to cheat and fights because I'd get in a fight in high
school,

390
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.730
I would just,
I would double leg them dude and just fucking get side,

391
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.380
twist your side control and punch him in the stomach.
And Tim.
Yeah,
but I,

392
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.150
you know,
I think that that was cheating,
but I didn't care.
It's,

393
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.160
I mean it is not a martial art in that it has finishing holds of its own because

394
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:58.220
most of it is just taking people down and holding them down and getting back up.

395
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.800
But if you can master that,

396
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.880
that is like one of the most important aspects of martial arts.
I mean,

397
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.180
and we never thought about it that way.
It took forever.

398
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.420
It's almost like it took the UFC to show that yeah.

399
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.220
Took the UFC to show that over and over again.

400
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.310
And I really worry or wonder rather what would have happened if the UFC in 93

401
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.700
had never been invented because of if there was never any kind of a tournament

402
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:25.730
like that to throw all these fighters together in a real organized way.

403
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.870
And he got real top level guys from each discipline eventually making their way

404
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:32.020
into the UFC.
What the fuck man?

405
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.830
A martial arts would be still back in the 1980s.
Yeah,

406
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.350
we'd have some idea of what worked and some idea would what,
you know,
don't,

407
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.910
don't try this,
but like we get down there,

408
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.540
we're doing Pancrase right.
Did they start doing pancreas?

409
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.060
I think they were doing it,
uh,
you know,

410
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.880
early nineties.
So it's a box.
Rutan Frank Shamrock,

411
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.670
Ken shamrock days,
Matt Hume's in it back then.
What years were those?

412
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.430
That's hard.

413
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:07.430
When was paying Crace one first aired on the 93 founding.

414
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.170
What month does it say?
93.
Damn.

415
00:25:11.171 --> 00:25:15.160
Cause that was the first UFC two November of 93 was the first year I've seen.

416
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.540
So it all basically happened around the same time.

417
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.670
I mean is it possible that in November of 93 they see the UFC and then

418
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:26.660
immediately Pancrase starts like a few weeks later and it's still 93 that was

419
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:31.430
established on May 16th,
1993 and their first event was promoted,

420
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.320
uh,
September 21st so establishing that morning and then in September.

421
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:40.610
And what was the UFC in 93 November,
November crazy.

422
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.070
So right before the UFC.

423
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.630
So neither one of them had been on air when they both started or they're both

424
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:51.240
putting it together.
It was a maybe Elekta idea was in the air,

425
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.690
maybe was in the air pro to believe in that.

426
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.740
The idea is to just out there in the air that is pretty crazy.

427
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.270
But the fighters and Pancrase,
they

428
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.170
didn't have the Jujitsu that the Brazilians had.
No,
there's a big difference.

429
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:12.250
There's a lot of light lofts going on back then.
Remember it.

430
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.940
Is that Ken shamrocks influence or was that a,
there's a lot of Japan,

431
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.350
Japan,
like catch wrestling influence,
right.
Look from Karl gotch and yeah,

432
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:24.630
Jay Japan's always been into the leg locks.
Sissy Robinson.
Yeah.

433
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:28.520
They've always been like,
like the soccer style that's very cash oriented,
right?

434
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.020
Yes.
Yes.
For those who don't know what we're talking about,

435
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.300
cash catch as catch can,
but make no mistake about it.

436
00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.570
Did the ground fighting was just on another level.

437
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:40.940
You could say whatever the hell you want,
but when you watch,
AH,

438
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.220
Alan goes fight in Pancrase against

439
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.400
<v 0>frank shamrock man,
do you see the difference in Jujitsu?</v>

440
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:51.690
Back then there was a big,
big difference.
Alan goes was all over frank shamrock.

441
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.990
Frank shamrock is a bad motherfucker.
You know what I mean?
Only you know,

442
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.700
he'd only been training for a cop.
Yeah.
He,
yeah,
he just crazy.
Yeah.

443
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.370
He was fighting against guys like boss route and when he had been training for

444
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:07.290
like a couple of years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember how Jack,
they were like,
Jesus,

445
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.000
anytime I'm wearing speedos,
anytime of Brazilian would,
uh,

446
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.690
would go against your,
your average pancreas guy.

447
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.990
There's a clear difference in the ground fighting current year difference and,

448
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:19.770
uh,

449
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:24.770
three pancreas offense before that first UFC Rolo all four events.

450
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.790
Oh yeah.
And what would you say in all,
all of them.

451
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.790
Interesting.
Yeah.
So look at that.

452
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.810
Bam.
It says that,

453
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:41.460
that the pancreas then came out of a wrestling organization in Japan where they

454
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:44.910
had like,
they were having problems with predetermined outcomes.
We started this.

455
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.920
Oh,
so you to have actual fights.
Yeah.
Funai interesting.
Yeah.

456
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:52.980
And then you look at Hixson versus Funai Colosseum.

457
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.780
Fucking difference in grappling.
Oh,
you know what I mean?
That's big as it gets.

458
00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.430
So you could see that.

459
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.700
So what the UFC did that pank grace didn't do,

460
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.290
uh,

461
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:12.290
and mainly because nobody in the western hemisphere even knew what the fuck it

462
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:14.820
was.
It was a Japanese thing.

463
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:18.450
So it's going to be hard to change the world when you're,
you know,

464
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:22.020
only televised in Japan.
And back then,
you know,
you gotta get like someone,

465
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:24.720
someone had a mail,
you a VHS tape,
you know what I mean?

466
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:29.130
You had to go to weird Japanese stores and,
and,
and see that.
So,

467
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.520
but the UFC made it clear that the Brazilians were doing a form of ground

468
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:36.330
fighting.

469
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:41.330
It was beyond and more sophisticated what we're seeing in Japan or anywhere else

470
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.570
in the world.
You know,
nobody had half the shit they were doing.
No.

471
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.650
Sambo had a down Samo has some good shit and judo.
Yes.
Judo.

472
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.370
Um,

473
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:58.140
most if not all Brazilian jujitsu moves.

474
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.460
I mean,
have been done in judo and they're actually,
they came from Judah.

475
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.630
We know that.
The Japanese know that.
Uh,
but,
uh,

476
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.930
a lot of American judo guys don't,
they can't,
they can't seem to grasp back.

477
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:13.770
And they're like,
you know,
the Gracies ripped off Newaza ads.

478
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:16.390
It's all about nuance.
And we used to,
you know,
there was a,
you know,

479
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.850
a sect of judo where they did focus on the ground,

480
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.340
but,
and that's all true.

481
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.540
But the major difference is the Brazilians,

482
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.770
they wanted to do a style where there wasn't a time limit on the ground.
In Judo,

483
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:35.940
you could only find on the ground for,
I don't know,
30 seconds.
It's,
it's limited.

484
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:39.510
It's not that much time.
So when you don't have that much time,

485
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.500
there's a lot of shit.

486
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.880
You don't need to waste your time drilling because you're only going to be down

487
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:47.080
there for 30 seconds.

488
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:50.380
You need to focus on the moves that work in 30 seconds and that's it.

489
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.520
You don't have time to set shit up and be patient and relax.

490
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.090
You can't clench and catch your breath.
You got to,
it's got to,

491
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.020
you got to go into it.

492
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:04.021
So with the Brazilians did is just allowed the fight to unfold on the ground

493
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:07.780
and,
and not have any standups and just let them fight on the ground.

494
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.630
And when that happens,
there's a lot,

495
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.460
there's so much more you can do when there's no time limit on the ground.

496
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.320
Not like no timeline.
I mean,
you know,

497
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.190
they're not going to without standups where you could just,
most of the matches,

498
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:22.570
Tate is,
takes place on the ground.

499
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.940
The game just evolves so quickly and so rapidly and,

500
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.910
and uh,
that you can't compare like eat Japanese guys come down to Brazil.

501
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.430
They did been doing judo their whole life and they get smoked by Brazilians.

502
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.290
That always happens in the world championships.

503
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.620
The Brazilians are just on the ground all day,
you know,

504
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.260
and the guys that do judo there on the ground a little bit,

505
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.760
they're never going to be able to compete in a sport where there's no standups.

506
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.000
You know,
so to say that,
uh,

507
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.620
Brazilian Jujitsu is just judo.
It's,
that's,
um,

508
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.180
you got to think about it.
You've got to really break it down.
Cause it's,
yeah,

509
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.130
<v 1>it still is.
It's silly.
There's so many silly connections to people have to arts,</v>

510
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.720
you know,
I mean there's,

511
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.900
there's people that legitimately think that white people shouldn't be able to

512
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:14.920
teach karate because it's cultural appropriation because it's a Japanese art.

513
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.950
There's people that think that stupid,
you know,
there's,

514
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.710
I think all of it's martial arts now.
I mean,

515
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:24.040
I think the roots and the bases are very important to recognize that,
you know,

516
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:28.060
hey,
you know,
Brazil did do a crazy thing with Jujitsu.
Hey,
uh,

517
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.080
the ties did do a crazy thing with leg kicks and elbows,
knees.

518
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.220
There's really some,

519
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.940
some people that have contributed to martial arts and it's really insane way.

520
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.930
And the people that highlight those disciplines like the elite of the elites,

521
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:45.710
like the book house and the Sand Shies and the Marcello Garcias and the jock

522
00:31:45.711 --> 00:31:48.610
arrays,
like all these people that highlighted on,
in each art,

523
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.500
they're all like super,
super important.

524
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.550
But overall it all comes into one thing.
And that's,

525
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.900
that's martial arts.
I think martial arts,
it's really,
um,

526
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.810
at this point it's really,

527
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:08.200
I mean ultimately it's,
it's one thing now ultimately,
ultimately,
like when you,

528
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:11.980
when you think about UFC,
when you think about just Bruce Lee movies,

529
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:16.450
what is it like fight how,
what's the best way to fight?
It's all together now.

530
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.050
It's all combined because the best way is not just wrestling,

531
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.840
it's wrestling with ferocious striking.

532
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.790
It's wrestling with leg kick defense,
it's wrestling with submission holds.

533
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.580
It's all these different things.
You have to have all these things.

534
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.570
You can't just be one thing anymore.
It's interesting to be from one discipline,

535
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.770
but it's like what if a kid is coming up right now and he's like your son's and

536
00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:40.160
he starts

537
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.470
<v 3>to learn martial arts techniques.</v>

538
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.970
I think by the time he gets to be our age,
it's just going to be martial arts.

539
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:48.650
We were just going to be taking martial arts.

540
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.340
I don't think there's going to be as many specialists in the future.

541
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:54.870
And I think that's probably a shame.
Like,
but no,

542
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.680
who's gonna want from a guy who did taekwondo his whole life?

543
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.220
Who's going to want to do that now?
Yeah.
But when you're talking about Jujitsu,

544
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.270
um,
most people that do Jujitsu,
um,

545
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.920
are not doing it,
uh,

546
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.970
or they don't stay in it for the long haul and make it a lifestyle for the self

547
00:33:13.921 --> 00:33:16.400
defense aspects.
They don't know.

548
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.130
They go in there cause they're playing a video game and they're staying in shape

549
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.690
right there playing a game of death,
virtual reality video game,

550
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.290
trying to get taps.
Try not to get a tap that much,
you know.

551
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.290
So do most of the guys in,
in,

552
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.650
you know that most of my students,
they're just like,
you know,

553
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.320
super nice sweetheart computer geeks,
just,

554
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.270
just the nicest guys.
They're not in there,
in there just to play.
Yeah.

555
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.500
Well there's a big difference between,
um,
we've talked about this before,

556
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:47.870
but the big difference between guys who trained together,

557
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.650
which are Jyutsu first guys train together with like kickboxing as the

558
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:55.430
kickboxing people,
they fucking hurt each other all the time.
Like bad.

559
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.620
Like they're beating each other up,
they're kicking each other,

560
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.740
punching each other and shit.
Jujitsu guys tap each other out and they're like,

561
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.040
oh,
I'm gonna get you back bitch.
And it's,
but it's okay.
Everybody's okay.

562
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.220
And that's the beauty of it.
We get to the,
the,

563
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.390
the reason why Jujitsu is,
uh,
it's,

564
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.380
I mean opening up a Jujitsu school like in,
in,

565
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.090
in society today is like one of the safest bets out there ever.
I,

566
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.410
it gets so addicting.
You can't download Jujitsu,
you can't pirate Jujitsu.

567
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.400
You know you are sparring rounds,
you know,
you,
you can't,

568
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:31.640
you have to go to a place and you have to go to a place where there's a bunch of

569
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:33.710
different and the more people there are,
the better.

570
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.480
The more variety of roles you can get.

571
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:37.220
Cause you don't want to just roll with the same guy all the time.

572
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.580
You want to mix it up,
mix your style with that guy style.

573
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.310
Go with the new guy who doesn't know your secret moves.

574
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:45.340
And he'd go on and you're like going with new dudes where you're,

575
00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:48.740
your setups work because the guys that you've been rolling with for awhile,

576
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.400
they smell out all your setups.

577
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.760
Now you've got to come up with new setups and then you've got to figure out a

578
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:57.440
different way around this problem.
It's just,
um,
it's just too much fun,

579
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:01.510
man.
It's,
it's so addicting and it has nothing to do with not,

580
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:06.520
I wouldn't say nothing,
but,
uh,
you know,
you do enjoy,
um,

581
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.460
the,
the self defense aspects,
like if anything went down,

582
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.390
it makes you feel better in certain situations.
Like you're not

583
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:20.960
as worried about things as you might be if you didn't know if he didn't know

584
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.170
martial arts.
You know,
the one thing that,
uh,

585
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.910
I'm going to start doing once I'm totally healed again,

586
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.290
I'm going to start kickboxing.
Yeah.

587
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:33.370
Cause I just see too many Instagram videos of dudes getting fucking lit up.

588
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.380
I'm like,
you know what,
it's a good idea once a week,
you know,

589
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.040
and I'm not going to make

590
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.910
<v 1>a big deal out of it.</v>

591
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.911
Maybe once a week tops once a week just to go in there and just sit up.

592
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.480
Video put up on Instagram today from Draka.
It's like a,

593
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.680
I think it's Draka underscored junior is the Instagram account.

594
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.540
It's a crazy Russian account and it's a two on one Russian fighting a giant dude

595
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.180
and two like normal size guys.
Yeah,
look at this.

596
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.140
Give you some volume.
JV.

597
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.390
<v 3>This is crazy.
Both of these guys do.</v>

598
00:36:08.391 --> 00:36:12.700
They do about one 60 and the other guy looks like he's about 300 fucking pounds.

599
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.803
Okay.
This

600
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.750
guy's ragdoll on these dudes that was knees.

601
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:23.410
Fuck this guy's giant,
man.
He's so much bigger than these two dudes.
Oh,

602
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.650
look at this.
He's a beast.
Holy Shit.

603
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.280
You have to do cardio two for a giant fucking dude.
This is the white Kimbo.
Yeah,

604
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.030
look,
he's a good leg kick checking.
He's got technique.

605
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.520
He's not just a giant dude.

606
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.370
They're not faking it,
right?
Oh Man.
They're beating the fuck out of each other.

607
00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:47.550
He's,
he's hitting his fucking guy hard.
Oh,

608
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.073
we'll kick.

609
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.760
<v 1>This is crazy.
I mean,</v>

610
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.810
this is not a smart thing for the little dudes because the problem is they don't

611
00:36:57.811 --> 00:36:59.010
have the horsepower.

612
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.160
They're not going to be able to take them out any videos on Instagram or due to

613
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:04.230
get lit up.
You got to have,

614
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.150
you've got to have the ability to knock somebody out if you had to and not do

615
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:09.730
Jiu Jitsu.

616
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.280
There's many situations where in a real life altercation,

617
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:17.590
getting on the ground is not the best idea.
And uh,

618
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.370
being able to light someone up or like three dudes,
no way.

619
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:23.160
You're going to be three dudes with Jujitsu,
you know,
and it happens,

620
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:25.800
you see on videos is like a myth.
It's like a mythical thing.

621
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:27.630
You can't beat multiple attackers.
Yes.

622
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:30.120
You fucking can like as you could with their striking,

623
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.520
if there was three dudes and then we're starting shit and you're like,
okay,

624
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:35.870
I'm gonna knock this motherfucker out first.
And then hopefully one dude,

625
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.970
we'll start running and then I'll fucking clean up the second guy,
you know,

626
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.833
or whatever.

627
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.160
But to have your level of striking is important.

628
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.410
It's important.
You know,
it's important.
It's important.

629
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:48.150
If you think that some of might be hitting you,

630
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.300
like if you think some of this mother fucker looks like he's going to swing on

631
00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:55.040
me,
like I've got a feeling like he's going to swing on me.
Yeah.
There's,

632
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.290
there's that,
that,
that moment when you're in a heightened sense of danger.

633
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.010
If you don't understand space,
like that's a real big thing.

634
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:05.430
One of the things about sparring that's really important is that you,

635
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:09.580
you know when you're safe and when you're not safe and you like,

636
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.180
a lot of people don't know,
they don't know when they can hit someone,

637
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:15.600
when someone can hit them.
And if someone thinks,

638
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.190
if you think someone's going to hit you and you can't get some space between
the,

639
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.860
you have to be ready and you have to understand like you have to have someone

640
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:27.090
have swung on you before.
So as you're seeing shit coming,
you gotta be able to,

641
00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:31.530
oh his back legs gone.
Okay.
I see.
Is Weight dip into the right hands coming in?

642
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.010
You know like there's a,
there's a,
you have to know certain,
otherwise

643
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.760
<v 3>you lock up.</v>

644
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.180
That's the scariest thing you ever seen a fight is dudes like things start

645
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:42.460
swinging and they just lock up cause they don't know what,

646
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.770
they don't know where it's coming from.
They don't know what's happening.

647
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.150
That's the most dangerous.

648
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:50.260
It's almost more important for defense than it is for anything because half the

649
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:50.471
time,

650
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:53.590
if you were ever in a fight with someone and they start just swinging at you,

651
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.730
if you have good defense,
you just stand there with your hands up and you wait.

652
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.960
You just wait,
let him swing,
let him swing,
keep moving.
You wait.
You wait.

653
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.290
How long are you gonna be able to do this?
Well,
you got 30 seconds in you.

654
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.643
He just wait.

655
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.200
He just wait and then all of sudden you see a little of this and you're like,
oh,

656
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.480
oh,
oh,
now you're tired.
You don't really know how to fight.

657
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.020
He just wanted to hit me when now we're going to fight and now you're tired.

658
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.040
Someone didn't do as sprints.
Well,
dot.
Just that you don't know what to do.
You,

659
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.900
you lock up and you're like,
eh.
People think that they can do that to people.

660
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:32.350
People that don't know how to fight,
blow their load.
They just blow their wad.

661
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.220
If you ever,
like if a guy like Joe Schilling is in a street fight,

662
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.320
there would be like the most terrifying thing in the world.

663
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.780
Like if you don't know and you fuck up.

664
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:43.240
And he got in some crazy street fight after one of his kickboxing fights

665
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:47.860
recently and some other country,
but a guy like that,

666
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.940
first of all,
he can fuck you up before you can fuck him up.
But second of all,

667
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.110
if he decides to just take his time with you,
well,

668
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:57.850
you're going to get into this place of doom,

669
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.570
this place of doom where you're exhausted and you've been trying to hurt him.

670
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.740
So he has all everything within his right to crush you and you know that and now

671
00:40:05.741 --> 00:40:09.100
you're tired.
Yeah.
But uh,
oh,

672
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.500
well the one thing that you notice in all of these fight videos and scuffles on

673
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:16.190
Instagram is that,
uh,

674
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.070
a lot of times it just seems like you got,

675
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.720
you got timed up to throw a couple punches and you ain't got to get the fuck
out.

676
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:28.240
Especially when it's multiple attackers.
Yeah.

677
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.760
You got to figure out which dude you're going to hit first.

678
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.540
There's going to be another one and usually that third guy runs it looks like.

679
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:36.160
He's like,
Oh shit,
he's out.

680
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.390
But if he stays down you one on one now you just knocked two dudes out.

681
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:44.560
Now it's one on one and if you got Joe Schilling type skills,
boom,

682
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:45.960
that's where it all comes in right there.

683
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:51.040
But it's almost better to just have wrestling and boxing in a street fight.

684
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.300
You don't really want to catch some.

685
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:56.530
Bruce Lee was preaching after all the shit after everything.

686
00:40:56.531 --> 00:41:00.760
He all the Kung Fu he grew up with,
he got to the states and he realized,

687
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:04.180
Holy Shit,
this wing Chung isn't working on this tall white boys.

688
00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.680
So he learned really quick a fight in a street closed quarters.

689
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.850
I mean maybe you be able to throw a kick through and he said in 1959 he said a

690
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:20.830
dude has been wrestling and boxing for one year can beat a lifelong martial

691
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:25.390
artists.
It's true.
Yeah,
it's true in a lot of ways.
If a guy doesn't know,

692
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:28.150
take down defense and the guy doesn't know how to actually box.
Dude.

693
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.630
I remember when I first started doing first started learning boxing and

694
00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:34.280
kickboxing from all my years of doing taekwondo

695
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.390
<v 1>and I threw punches and taekwondo,
but I had a crazy,</v>

696
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:42.500
distorted perception of my ability with my hands.

697
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.630
Like I thought it'd be able to,
I was like,
I know how to strike that.

698
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.020
He doesn't know how to strike.
I just knew how to do taekwondo.

699
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.680
I was good at that.
And then when I started kickboxing,
dude,
I was getting lit up.

700
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.520
Especially when you're in it.
Rain can't go anywhere.
You trapped in this ring.

701
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.360
Does taekwondo have a reverse punch?
Yeah,
it's got reverse punch.
Scott,
you know,

702
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.910
it's got all these,
he's got a hand techniques,

703
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:03.320
but when you fight and tournament's,

704
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.100
everything is below the neck for punches.

705
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.810
So everything is below here.

706
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:13.520
It's just the body for punches and you can kick to the head and he kicked to the

707
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:14.870
body.
You can't kick to the legs.

708
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.650
So all it does is make you really good at kicking.
That's what it really does.

709
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.680
But the,
the,
the distance is all fucked up.

710
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.440
And then I realized that like once I started doing kickbox,

711
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.980
all my distance is so fucked up because when I think I'm safe,

712
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.610
I'm good still get punched in the face.
And if the crowd may,

713
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:33.140
they get punched in the face and I can't kick him,

714
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:36.590
like my distance is all messed up and then it's also way easier to punch me than

715
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:39.660
I thought it was.
So I had to learn and and,

716
00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:42.410
and in learning it was fucking super humbling man.

717
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.310
Super humbling because I went from being someone who I considered myself like an

718
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:49.790
elite striker.
Like I was on a national level for taekwondo.
I,

719
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.830
I fought in a lot of national tournament's I could,

720
00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:56.120
I fought like a bunch of guys were really good and I hung in there with them.

721
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.080
I thought it was really good.

722
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.240
Just regular kickboxers Pete and the fuck out of me just beating my ass dude.

723
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.430
Just getting me in the corner,
Jabbing me broken off the jab right hand.
I'm like,

724
00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:10.880
you're calling.
Oh No,
this is terrible,
isn't it?
Isn't it weird for sure.

725
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:14.180
Taekwondo has got the best,
uh,
spinning kicks in.
All that shit.
Yeah.

726
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:18.650
It's got some really good kicks.
Yeah.
The sidekick is the best kick for sure.

727
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.513
Best.
Uh,

728
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.610
the best version of the side kicks the taekwondo sign that the heads of the

729
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.410
Taekwondo Association,
whatever the,
whatever it's called,
they,
they can't add.

730
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.820
They can't admit that their hands suck.
You know what I mean?
They can't admit it.

731
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:39.110
You would think that the heads would say,
you know what,
Shit maybe we should do.

732
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.610
Maybe we should add western boxing to this shit.
You know what I mean of them do.

733
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.110
I'm sure some of them do.
So I'm heads dumped it.

734
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.470
Like you would think it's so traditional,
like they won't change it.

735
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.030
It's cars to clear.

736
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:55.070
It's crystal clear that the best hands are Western boxing hands.

737
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:58.610
It's crystal clear.
The world knows this.
But at the top,

738
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:03.200
like you don't like even in the karate associations or come through associations

739
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.240
bay,
they won't alter the style.
Right,
right.
Well,
you know,

740
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:12.800
one thing that is interesting is karate at least emphasizes the idea of punching

741
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:15.500
things without gloves on because there is a difference.

742
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:18.890
There's a pretty big difference to punching things with gloves on without gloves

743
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:21.790
on.
And one of the things that karate figured out a long time ago,

744
00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:23.270
so you've got to condition your knuckles,

745
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.660
condition your hands and condition your knuckles.
They never had that even,

746
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.960
I mean I guess maybe some people had it in taekwondo,

747
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:33.180
but it was never anything in my organization where they have like a mock Hawara,

748
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.370
which is like a book.
If you don't know what we're talking about.

749
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:39.000
There's a board with rope wrapped around its hard rope and they just fucking

750
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:39.810
smacked,

751
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.810
just punched that rope until their knuckles became like my friend John Lee who I

752
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:45.661
told you about,

753
00:44:45.661 --> 00:44:49.140
he's the guy that I saw kicked the bag for the first time and Ben didn't have

754
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.020
national champion.
He was a monster.

755
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.520
He had one hand where he only had one knuckle is his first two knuckles were

756
00:44:56.521 --> 00:45:00.570
just one.
It was one giant.
Not,
it wasn't,

757
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.720
it wasn't like my hand looks like with two distinct knuckles.

758
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.900
It was just a boulder over there all from punching bricks who just break bricks

759
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:12.150
with his knuckles and he would pray work.
So that shit works.
Oh yeah.

760
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.910
Mad Mad arthritis when he get older.
Oh really?

761
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:17.870
Shit.

762
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:22.870
So not good to just beat on a joint until a callous and forget that this is what

763
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:26.720
I heard.
Maybe that's a,
maybe that's a fake rumor too,

764
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.910
but a lot of those guys that uh,
that did that,

765
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:33.770
they would practice on Maca wars and on bricks and just constantly be punching

766
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.370
bricks.

767
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:39.370
And so John had hands where he could lick legitimately punched someone very hard

768
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.820
and not worry about it with bare knuckle.
Whereas a lot of people in your hand,

769
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.670
your hand is way we think about what your hand is like.

770
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:50.610
Move your hand around like this.
Think about all these little parts.

771
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.500
This is the worst thing you want to hit somebody with.

772
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.060
That's why this elbows are so much better.
Elbows are so much better.

773
00:45:57.061 --> 00:46:02.040
Your palms even better.
Yeah.
This is crazy.
This thing articulate and it moved.

774
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:06.270
This is for piano.
It's not for Hulk Smash.
Look at this.

775
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.620
Oh Shit.

776
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.740
Thoughts it money wise that a guy's arthritis from using the [inaudible].

777
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.220
There was a styles knuckles.
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
Nice.

778
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.520
There was a style that did a address weaknesses in a bunch of styles and just do

779
00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:27.510
you remember?
Um,
and then I forget who formed it,

780
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:31.880
but he formed a style that had the best of what he thought of like five systems

781
00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:34.910
caught.
You Kimbo remember that cod?

782
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.500
You Kimbo who packed to get karate?

783
00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:42.940
A Jew maybe Jujitsu or judo cause you can't add and Kempo karate and Bart Vale

784
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:50.070
and Bo.
No.
And a bowl for boxing,
Silva's boxing,
karate,

785
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:55.230
judo and Kempo karate.
Do you remember Bart Vale?
Yeah.

786
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.560
Dude Barksdale was another guy who was like a pioneer of MMA that people seem to

787
00:46:59.561 --> 00:47:02.310
have forgot about Kaci Kimbo I can't believe I just remembered him.

788
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.940
Oh look at that was a little bit of a wing.
Chung,
a little bit of sidekick in

789
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.720
Google.
Bart Vail.
He was one of the early guys.
Man,

790
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.150
I fucking completely forgot about him.

791
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.620
He was a big giant dude too.
He's a shoot fighter.
Yeah,

792
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:26.880
he fought.
That's right.
He fought fucking Cam shamrock in pancreas.
Look at this.

793
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.590
Yeah.
And this is before the UFC too.
Yeah.

794
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.380
<v 3>These guys used to,</v>

795
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

796
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.650
<v 3>They,
they had the open slap was interesting too.
Right?</v>

797
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.460
There weren't a lot of punch each other.
They,
but they were allowed to open slap.

798
00:47:40.461 --> 00:47:41.480
Like how weird is that?

799
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.160
So strange watching these old,
old fights.

800
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:50.720
US Big fucking Bart veil is compared to Ken Shamrock,
who's a big fucking dude,

801
00:47:50.721 --> 00:47:55.670
man.
He always had American flag shorts on.
Right.

802
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.540
The one thing we failed to mention that,

803
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:04.630
that we should bring up is whether or not Horian Gracie or art Davey or

804
00:48:06.111 --> 00:48:09.350
influenced by pancreas or not.
Like what came out first.

805
00:48:09.351 --> 00:48:12.260
So a few months in Brazil,

806
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.900
they were doing that shit since like the 20s and thirties and forties yeah.

807
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:20.420
Right.
So really it probably all started in Brazil.

808
00:48:20.421 --> 00:48:21.740
If you break it down like that,

809
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:25.970
I mean hell y'all Gracie was fighting what in the forties or the 50s or

810
00:48:25.971 --> 00:48:27.050
something.
Yeah.
You know,

811
00:48:27.051 --> 00:48:31.220
Carlson Gracie took over like in the 60s it was huge in Brazil.

812
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.190
So not only did Brazil,

813
00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:39.410
it not only is Brazil responsible for the level of grappling in the world today,

814
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.341
it's,

815
00:48:40.341 --> 00:48:45.230
it's for sure the Brazilians got to have all the credit for that for sure.

816
00:48:45.231 --> 00:48:50.220
Come on now.
Yeah,
I mean when,
so also MMA,
they were doing valley today.

817
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.290
Only $2 old school.
They were the Brazilians for some reason.

818
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:55.700
I don't know what it,
what it was,

819
00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.810
but they figured out a lot of good shit.
Right.

820
00:48:59.811 --> 00:49:02.150
Then Hixon Gracie match news 18 against Zulu,

821
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.310
the figured out [inaudible] he are you kidding me?

822
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.940
You've got an Uber Tuba right there on Ventura.
You ever go there?
No.

823
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:13.520
That's the kind of cause all these little pussy ass little juice shops try to

824
00:49:13.521 --> 00:49:15.820
have [inaudible] they don't do it right.
The,

825
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:20.240
the way Uber Tuba does it is exactly the way you get it in Brazil.

826
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.410
So God damn,

827
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.440
what is this 1920s fighting sideshows called Valley Tudo became popular in

828
00:49:26.481 --> 00:49:29.990
Brazilian circus is during the 1920s Jesus Christ.

829
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.260
So they were doing this before they found Jujitsu.
And Jujitsu.

830
00:49:33.261 --> 00:49:36.870
They just figured it like the them see the,

831
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:41.810
the last piece of the puzzle.
They were already doing it before 1920.

832
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:46.100
It says Kelly.
Oh,
started her.
I think Heleo is doing Jujitsu and the 20,
13,

833
00:49:46.101 --> 00:49:50.540
14 or something.
When did my eight to come to Brazil?
That's a good question.

834
00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.270
When did,
I thought that was in the fourth year.

835
00:49:53.271 --> 00:49:56.120
Did Heleo Gracie because Carlos Gracie learned first.

836
00:49:56.121 --> 00:50:00.950
What year did Carlos Gracie first learn Jujitsu?
Count my Ada.
Right.

837
00:50:00.951 --> 00:50:05.060
It was count my eight.
Uh,
when did he first meet Carlos Gracie?
It's amazing,
man.

838
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.760
Again,
think about the billions of people on the planet.

839
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.880
These two people don't meet.
If one guy doesn't teach another guy judo,

840
00:50:10.881 --> 00:50:15.380
the whole world's different.
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.

841
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:18.560
Really crazy.
And then what country did you go to?
You know,

842
00:50:18.561 --> 00:50:23.200
did he go to Norway or did he go to Germany?
Did he go?
No,
no,

843
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:25.250
you went to this place where they're already doing this.

844
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.190
He comes down to teachers of at a place where they're already

845
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.190
<v 1>getting wild or they're already having these wild ass fights and he figures out</v>

846
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.330
how to get it to the craziest family or the best way possible.

847
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.540
You see the word creamy

848
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.210
<v 4>sort of in 1917</v>

849
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.860
<v 3>I do.
Yes.
So maybe they learn Jujitsu and they remain start having fights.</v>

850
00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:51.330
Exactly.
Maybe Valerie Trudeau who invented valley too though.

851
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.940
Was it the Gracies?
How crazy is that?

852
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.460
Who first started doing Valley Tuto in Brazil?
That's what,
that's what I wanted.

853
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.910
<v 1>Been influenced by the initial learning of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu from three years</v>

854
00:51:02.911 --> 00:51:03.744
ago.

855
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:09.300
Or maybe it's just a bunch of dudes who were terrible at Jujitsu.

856
00:51:09.301 --> 00:51:10.830
Just like in Japan.
Well,

857
00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:14.280
when I came into the UFC was 97 so it was basically the same amount of time

858
00:51:14.281 --> 00:51:15.450
afterwards.
Right.

859
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.410
So think about if like Jujitsu is introduced to Brazil three years before they

860
00:51:19.411 --> 00:51:23.160
start doing these valley to dope things.
When I first got into the UFC,

861
00:51:23.161 --> 00:51:27.180
it was 97 and you and I went to one in 97 member.
Yup.

862
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.080
And those days it was,
everything was like,
it was like,

863
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.300
it had to be probably how,

864
00:51:33.301 --> 00:51:36.270
like how they were on a larger scale because it was on cable,

865
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.570
but how they were looking at it like,
oh,
here's this new thing.

866
00:51:39.571 --> 00:51:42.720
Everybody's figured out this new thing.
This is the new thing.
Oh,

867
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.820
can we try this new thing?
We're going to have these fights.

868
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.150
I'm gonna put these fights together.
Real similar timeline.
But the Brazilians,

869
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.470
<v 3>we're,
how many years earlier?
1920,
70,</v>

870
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:58.070
70 years earlier.
It was anybody doing that before the 1920 to do that.

871
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:02.850
It's really crazy.
Who really invented valid know?
Oh,
maybe it was like,
uh,

872
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.970
maybe,
you know what?
Maybe a them catch wrestling.
Um,

873
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.250
a no holds bar fights that they would do an insert kisses.

874
00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:12.240
There was a little something with it.
Yeah.
Maybe that,

875
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.370
I think that was in the 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

876
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:19.130
<v 4>Set A and M my adas Wikipedia that at nine 18 to 79,</v>

877
00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:21.680
Ulysses s grant,
former president at the time,

878
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:24.830
visited Japan and while in Tokyo attended a Jujitsu presentation.

879
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:29.020
<v 1>Whoa.
Interesting.
1879,</v>

880
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.520
1879 but Japanese,
Japanese,

881
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.720
do you get these different than Brazilian Jujitsu?
Well,

882
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:39.640
didn't was it Teddy Roosevelt,
one of them way different.
Studied judo.

883
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.580
Some one of the,
one of the former presidents study judo today,

884
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.400
Abraham Lincoln before he was president,

885
00:52:45.401 --> 00:52:49.240
used to travel around and re challenge the rest of us.
Yeah.
Yeah.

886
00:52:49.241 --> 00:52:50.290
He's a big old tall dude.

887
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.760
See I think there's a lot of those guys that a would do that just for money.

888
00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:58.210
They would travel around and then there was people that would take on all comers

889
00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:01.440
and you know,
local towns.
It was a way to make money.
Yeah.

890
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.520
But the rules matter,
like if you're doing challenge matches,
uh,

891
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:09.070
cause in catch wrestling in the sport,

892
00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.890
you're not allowed to put someone in full guard.
I don't think.

893
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.980
I don't know about God is like in Russell the rules in wrestling,
wrestling,

894
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:17.380
then just regular wrestling.

895
00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:20.880
You can't put anybody in your garden and work your guard and catch wrestling.

896
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.340
Similar catch wrestling.
You can win by pin too.
Right?

897
00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.100
Is that think so.

898
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:29.150
<v 0>It's,
it's um,
that's like what?
It's,</v>

899
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:33.930
it's a wrestling based art,
but you could also get a guy and Kamora yes.

900
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.930
Or an Americana.
Yeah,
you choke them.

901
00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:39.240
It truly is I think so a submission,

902
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:43.440
wrestling with the problem and the big problem with catch wrestling and has a

903
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:47.670
lot of wonderful things for sure.
Um,
a lot like,
you know,
the Camorra,

904
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:52.530
there's a lot of great shit and catch wrestling,
but the fact that,

905
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.390
uh,
you can't put you can't work from your full guard,
uh,

906
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:02.450
means that not only does the system have no guard work really or,

907
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:04.830
or super limited guard work,

908
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:07.500
like someone's going to send me a picture of look a picture of some old catch

909
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:12.150
wrestler in the guard or something.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
I,
I get it.
It existed.

910
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.010
But I'm talking about,
um,

911
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.280
a sport where you're allowed to work from the guard with without being stood up

912
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.670
or without being penalized.
You know what I mean?
Y'alls didn't have that.
So what,

913
00:54:22.671 --> 00:54:27.270
what means?
What that means is the guard passing was nonexistent as well.

914
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.010
If you don't want,
if you're not allowed to play guard,

915
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.660
why would you bother learning and drilling all these different paths?

916
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.630
Combos.
It's a lot of time.
So that's,

917
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.170
that's what the kid catch wrestling was missing was the guard and the guard

918
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:42.720
passing.
But they had all the submissions and it's a beautiful thing,

919
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:47.170
but it was like that in Japan in a lot of ways too that when you watch old Penn,

920
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.350
no one's working from the guard.
There's no tech,

921
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.990
there's no technical half guard stuff.
There's,

922
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:56.030
it's just wide open basic movements,
um,

923
00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.490
off your back.
And that's one of the,

924
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:04.520
that's the biggest thing that the Brazilians brought to the game is guard

925
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:09.090
passing.
Um,
which means on the flip side,
you've got to have,
you know,

926
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:13.680
super hard guard to pass,
you know,
and that changes everything.

927
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.620
I changed everything and,
and uh,

928
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.960
and trying to figure out a way to do real fights,
you know,

929
00:55:18.961 --> 00:55:22.830
that's why they had a fake,
a lot of fights because there was so much missing.

930
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.460
The fights would,
you know,
when you put two white belts together on the ground,

931
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.850
there's not going to be a submission going on.
It's going to be a,

932
00:55:28.851 --> 00:55:32.400
it's not going to be entertaining to watch two people on the ground in a

933
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:33.840
position like the guard or whatever,

934
00:55:33.841 --> 00:55:36.630
where you just don't spend a lot of time and it gets really boring.

935
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.390
So that's why you'd have to fake it.
You're like,
you know what,

936
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:43.620
if we're going to allow him by fake it like pro wrestling,
like pro wrestling,

937
00:55:43.621 --> 00:55:46.830
the origins of pro wrestling.
I mean if you look,
think about pro wrestling,

938
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.890
pro wrestling is just a fake UFC cause they're on the ground.
They do a,
um,

939
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.830
they,
you know,
they do leg locks and shit and they do,
they'll do Google.

940
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.560
Black does now,
but grave digging all over the fucking the undertaker.
Yeah.

941
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.290
Only because they would have did it before if they would've known what was

942
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:01.711
possible.

943
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:04.680
They just didn't spend enough time on the ground without standups and without

944
00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:09.000
penalties to figure out there's so much you could do on the ground.
And that's,

945
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:10.920
that's what changed everything.

946
00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:14.460
That's what made it so that you don't have to fake fights anymore.

947
00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.790
Although there are fake fights,
you know,
especially in your path.

948
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:18.720
I think that's why they started faking fights.

949
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:21.540
I think they just wanted to make it more entertaining and they want to be able

950
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:24.100
to do it every night.
Well,
yes,
that's I saw on the road.

951
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.590
<v 1>No,
no,
that's what I'm saying.
They want to make it more entertaining if it,</v>

952
00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.410
if it's real,
it's not entertaining because you have two dudes.

953
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.400
You want to be able to do it every night.
You want.

954
00:56:31.401 --> 00:56:32.590
You want to be able to travel on the road.

955
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:34.780
I know channel 10 I don't know their schedule.

956
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:36.310
I don't know exactly how to grew up.
Yeah.

957
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:37.900
Maybe they went out once every six months.

958
00:56:37.901 --> 00:56:39.280
Maybe they went out every once a month.

959
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.640
I'm not too sure of the frequency of their fights,

960
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.670
but 100% you go,

961
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:49.900
you take a time machine back to 1860 and you go to a carnival and you watch this

962
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:51.310
dude,
that guy dude's grapple.

963
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.930
You're not going to see a high tech guard work.
You know what I mean?

964
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.080
You're not going to see high tech guard passing,

965
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:02.260
you're just not going to see it exist.
It exist in judo,

966
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:04.220
but not that much because yeah,

967
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:08.170
unless you're doing new Waza Newaza was a judo style that spent more time on the

968
00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:12.580
ground,
but still they didn't make an impact.
Like,
like,
uh,
the Gracies did well.

969
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:17.581
When you watch someone who's a really good guard expert on their back and you

970
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:21.640
know,
you watched someone trapped in that Web,
you know,
it's,
it's really,

971
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:25.430
it's very interesting now you don't have to fake exist before the UFC that

972
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:29.080
thought that a guy on his back could be like super dangerous.

973
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:32.620
That was a totally new concept.
Yeah.
Dan Severn hoists grace.
Yeah.

974
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:35.770
That was the one you had a fight like that one exist.
I mean,

975
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:39.400
he was on his back and he had Dan Severn and his guard,
I don't know,

976
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:42.880
like 15 minutes or something like that.
It was a long time.

977
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:47.590
That was the longest match hoist had been in and he ended up triangling up.

978
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.200
You know,
you,
uh,
you know,
when you,

979
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:55.770
when the Arno standups a lot more patience is involved.

980
00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:01.210
And,
um,
set ups and,
and there's so much more.

981
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:04.870
It's like a whole nother dimension opens up when there's no standups.

982
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:09.280
So this weekend is Darren till versus Wonderboy.

983
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.240
Excuse me versus Tyron Woodley.
Why don't I say versus Wonderboy?

984
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.810
We'll kind of flip was that,
and you know why?

985
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:17.230
Because it was reading a article of this really interesting article about

986
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.570
Wonderboy and his last three fights,

987
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.350
the two fights with Tyron Woodley that were super duper close.

988
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:26.290
And then one fight with Darren till that was also really close.

989
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.850
And they were talking about like how,
um,
if you looked at it on paper,

990
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.820
the people from outside,
I think there were,

991
00:58:33.821 --> 00:58:35.620
there were saying that global scorecard,

992
00:58:35.621 --> 00:58:38.290
I think that's how they're describing it,
meaning how people scored it,

993
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:40.450
like on average around the world.
Uh,

994
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:44.530
more people gave it to Wonderboy then gave it to Darren till.

995
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.520
And the same thing happened with,
um,
the Tyron Woodley fights.

996
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:51.280
I feel like the decisions were right in all those fights.

997
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:55.570
I feel like I'm in the woods.
He fights in particular Woodley hurt Wonderboy.

998
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.330
Wonderboy didn't really hurt with the,
I think that counts for more.

999
00:58:58.331 --> 00:59:02.440
It just does Woodley.
Um,
Tyron Woodley had them out.
I mean he had,

1000
00:59:02.441 --> 00:59:07.390
I'm really hurt and Wonderboy never had Tyron in that kind of trouble in either

1001
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:08.590
one of those fights.
So I would,

1002
00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:11.680
I would give that advantage clearly to tire and I would think that if he lost

1003
00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.150
that fight,
that would make it any sense.

1004
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.060
Cause fights are supposed to be about who does the most damage.

1005
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.650
Who of WHO's more effective.
I mean Wonderboy was effective for more time,

1006
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.520
but that's just like movement and sticking and hitting him,

1007
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:29.840
hitting him with small shots.
But Tyron put him on,
you know,

1008
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.370
unconsciousness his door.
He was like right there.
It was very dangerous.

1009
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:38.310
It was way different.
And plus you got the camp pals.
Yeah.
They said,
well I,
I'm,

1010
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:42.170
I'm not sure I believe that.
I think,
you know,
if someone really wins a decision,

1011
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:43.130
they really wanted decision,

1012
00:59:43.131 --> 00:59:47.880
but it's just what's most important is damage.
If you,

1013
00:59:47.881 --> 00:59:49.610
you guys are basically in a striking exchange.

1014
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:54.170
We're not talking about like submission attempts versus striking exchanges.

1015
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.960
Like which one's better?
He almost had him choked out with that triangle.
Well,

1016
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:58.490
he almost had them knocked out with that left hook.

1017
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:02.150
We're not talking about that because it was basically just a striking match and

1018
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:03.980
in just as plain old striking match,

1019
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.340
Willie was the one who landed the bigger shots.
In my mind.

1020
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.110
We've got to figure out a way to quantify that.

1021
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.850
It just doesn't make any sense where you could see a guy having a guy fucked up

1022
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:15.350
and almost out to,

1023
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:18.230
I think the same way about the Robert Whitaker Yoel Romero fight.

1024
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.190
There's two rounds in that fi where Yoel Romero is land in bombs on Whitaker.

1025
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:26.900
Whitaker is hurt bad.
How does he lose that fight?
I don't understand that.

1026
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.580
It doesn't make sense to me.

1027
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.940
Even if it makes sense in the current scoring system,

1028
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.800
that scoring system is fucking flawed.
That shit doesn't make any sense.

1029
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.260
Like a logically when you're looking at what is the,

1030
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.460
what's the ultimate goal of fighting.
But if you look at those three fights,

1031
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:48.610
just at least on paper wonder boys like right up there and Darren till with one

1032
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:51.230
fight with cowboy one fight with him.

1033
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.660
Those two fights were their most high profile fights of his career.

1034
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:57.560
Boom already got a title shot.
It's really interesting.
That's how,

1035
01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:02.390
that's how talented Darren till is.
People are so interested in him.
17 to know,

1036
01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:05.510
25 years old,
they're like,
fuck,
give him a chance.

1037
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.100
The real battle for this guy almost is not just a the fight,

1038
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.630
which is going to be of course a battle,

1039
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.010
but making 170 and how much longer does he do that?
He's,

1040
01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:17.210
I mean he fucking,

1041
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.420
he's hurting to get down to one 70 apparently he was at one 82 yes,

1042
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.930
he's giant dude.
Giant.
You see how much bigger he is in Woodley?

1043
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.270
This is the video at the press conference.

1044
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.300
When I stand next to each other and how tall is he till puts his hands over his

1045
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:36.650
head.
I can't tell.
It says inches high.
He's gotta be six too.

1046
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:40.070
But he said a big giant,
six to six foot even.

1047
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:44.300
That's just six foot even 72 inches.
That's right.
It is.

1048
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.740
He seems way taller than that.
Watch the go to the video of them.
Um,

1049
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.070
that's crazy.
Why don't think he was six to anyway,
just still,

1050
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.300
we're talking one 70 his clearly taller.
He's a big fucker too.

1051
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:02.750
It's not just tall.
He's thick.
You know he's a,

1052
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.410
he's a big fucking guy and he has a hard time making that weight.

1053
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.350
Look how fucking big he is,
dude.
Seriously.

1054
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:13.130
That looks like more than three inches.

1055
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.990
Unless he's wearing some crazy cowboy boots.
I don't know,
but look,

1056
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:21.910
it's going to be hard to do anything that Woodley man.
Very hard.
Well,

1057
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.940
there's a bunch of things with wood and the first of all,

1058
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.850
the fucking speed you're dealing with speed that you,

1059
01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.260
you probably haven't seen before.
Exactly.
And that his level of wrestling,

1060
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.380
look at these two guys.
He doesn't want to to isn't,

1061
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.290
there's no submitting till.
I mean,
he knows Jujitsu for sure.

1062
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:44.340
He lived in Brazil for a few years.
He actually speaks,
speaks Portuguese.
Oh Shit.

1063
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:48.500
Okay.
Yeah.
Um,
he got stabbed in London and then uh,

1064
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.920
went to Brazil to fucking recoup and hi,

1065
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:56.340
hang out and live there for awhile.
I don't know the full story of it,

1066
01:02:56.341 --> 01:02:59.790
but he speaks perfect Portuguese after one of his fights in Brazil,

1067
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:02.310
he addressed the crowd and Portuguese or she crazy.

1068
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:07.020
I haven't heard any trash talking from uh,
Connor as I have.
I have,

1069
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:10.950
I missed it.
He's not doing any press.
He's not,
oh,
shit is not doing anything.

1070
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:15.020
Figured it out.
You figured out the promotion on your dawn.

1071
01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:20.150
Here is,
what about a countdown shops?

1072
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:24.150
I Bay,
I think he basically said,
listen man,
I'm going to fight and that's it.

1073
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.020
That's what's going to happen October six.
I'm going to fight and that's it.

1074
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:31.830
I'm not doing like the promotion to think he's done,
man.

1075
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:36.420
Now he's hit that play.
First of all,
he just won $100 million.

1076
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.560
He probably thinks that you could suck all the decks.
I'm here right now.

1077
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.720
If you want milk,
I want to fight.
That's what I want to do.

1078
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:44.730
I don't want to do any of your bullshit.
I want to fight.

1079
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.750
So on October 6th I'm going to show up and fight,
figured out all the rest.

1080
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:53.110
October 5th I'll be there to make weight.
October six and his accent though,

1081
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:57.900
I wish I could.
I'd have to listen to him a few more times.
If he dies,

1082
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:02.550
he dies.
Then it says,
hold on,
go back down.
Right.
What are you doing?
If he dies,

1083
01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:07.510
he dies.
Then I'm paid twice.
It's got 1.3 million light.
What does that mean?
Yeah.

1084
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:10.110
It's a lot of likes so much.
What does that mean right there?
Yeah.

1085
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.020
He's trying to just stay relevant.
Let's try to put some words out there.

1086
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.360
Look sexy.
It probably got someone to doing it for them.

1087
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.430
Some a little assistant and you know,

1088
01:04:17.431 --> 01:04:19.920
he's probably concentrate on the fight and they said Conor is just good.

1089
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:22.440
And he's like,
yeah,
it's fucking good.
Put it up.

1090
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:29.790
I,
I'll tell you what man,
I can't fucking wait for that fight.
And you know,

1091
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.690
you know if one of them drop out,
you know Tony Anderson?
Yeah.
Tony Ferguson.

1092
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.160
Ready to go.
Ready to go.
And he's on the card anyway.

1093
01:04:38.161 --> 01:04:39.460
And the undercard against Pedis.
Right.

1094
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:44.460
So they would definitely do Ferguson and not Pettis.
Uh,

1095
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.920
I think so.
I'm not sure.
I think,

1096
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980
did they offer Norma Madoff to pedis when all that shit was going down in New

1097
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.000
York and Brooklyn?
I know the offered it to.
Um,
they were gonna have it.

1098
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.320
[inaudible] got cut.
Right.
And they wouldn't,

1099
01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:03.810
they didn't let Paul Felder cause Paul Felder wasn't ranked high enough,

1100
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:07.320
which is crazy.
They let ally acquainted do it,
but it was,

1101
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:11.520
I think they offered his report was Pettis and fell to,
were both denied.
Mm.

1102
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:15.690
Interesting medicine,
Felder,
bolts and nuts.
Well,
um,

1103
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:18.320
you know,
has just [inaudible]

1104
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:22.590
<v 3>by triangle.
He looked good.
He looked like he's back.
That I'm,
I don't,</v>

1105
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.570
I selfishly hope that uh,

1106
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.390
no one drops out because first of all I want to see that fight.
But two,

1107
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.460
I really want to see Tony versus pedis.
Yeah,
that's a,

1108
01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:35.170
that's a really interesting fight,
man.
Yeah,
Tony's looking good man.

1109
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.290
I bet he is looking good.
It's amazing how quick he came back from that surgery.

1110
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:41.830
It's amazing,
man.
It's amazing.
He's looking really good.

1111
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:45.100
He's breakdancing and wants to break dance when he's guy just blew his knee

1112
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.610
ligaments off his bones,
quit drinking,
no more drink and he's,
it's cleanest.

1113
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:55.360
Fuck has diets.
He looks great right now.
Cause look squad.
Yeah,
he's in,

1114
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.800
he's in tremendous shape.

1115
01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:00.370
How much was he drinking them for the best shape of his life?
Uh,
you know,

1116
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.460
a couple of beers here and there,
you know what I mean?
Uh,
no big deal.

1117
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:06.670
But he's um,
but he said,
fuck none of that.
No.
Oh Dude,

1118
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.600
that injury just changed everything for him.
That injuries.

1119
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:14.200
Like it just made them reevaluate his life and now he's coming back stronger

1120
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:17.350
than ever,
man.
Well,
when something like that happens,
you realize like,
Whoa,

1121
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:22.290
one of these,
that's really,
this catastrophic could be the end of my career.
Yeah.

1122
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.740
Yeah.
It's possible.

1123
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:28.770
And it's so possible that Connor or Khabib could drop out at soap possible.

1124
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.100
So possible.
That's the backup plan.
Pedis and Tony is the backup plan.

1125
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.520
But what are we at now?
We're still a month away.
Today's the sixth.

1126
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.670
We have a whole month.
Yup.
Dude,

1127
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:43.630
the world could fall apart in a month and a month.
Yeah.
And it,

1128
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:47.410
that weekend is going to be fucking insane cause that's,
that's in Vegas on that,

1129
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.220
on that Saturday,
the Friday before his quintet three.
That's going to be insane.

1130
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.110
What's that?
If he seen quintet yet?
The team Jujitsu only Jujitsu.

1131
01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.940
What?
Soccer Robichaud.
Oh my God.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm confused.

1132
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:04.840
I thought you meant team like four guys against four guys attacking each other

1133
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:07.990
all at once.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I was watching that video.
The Russian guy.

1134
01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:12.010
It's still in my head and I nine nine a quintet.
Sakharova shell.
I did,

1135
01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:14.020
I saw the Bogie choked out soccer,
rob.
I was like,

1136
01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.450
the craziest Shit I've ever seen.

1137
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:20.500
Craziest experience of ever been in my life is as far as Jujitsu goes.

1138
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:25.450
It's so different now.
I've never done this teen Jujitsu.

1139
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.220
It's fucking insane.

1140
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:32.221
It was so many ups and downs in saying why was Geo grappled against the guy that

1141
01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:37.720
was so big?
Well this is the way they do it.
Okay,
so there's four teams.
It's a,

1142
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.910
it's a four man bracket and you know,

1143
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:42.520
the winner of these two teams fights the winner,
these two teams,

1144
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:45.670
and then they have their,
you're in the finals,
so it's five on five,

1145
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.880
950 pound weight limit.

1146
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:52.750
So you get the whole stack for the whole five.
Oh,
you get to divvy it up,

1147
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.020
however you want humans to monsters series two matches.

1148
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:58.720
But then you've got to have like little,
little guys here.
So,
um,

1149
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:00.940
and when ends up happening,
we had to,

1150
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:05.740
we had Adam sack Knauf and Amea alarm are two giant guys that are like both,

1151
01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:08.830
like two 20.
And then,
uh,
we had geo,

1152
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:14.350
PJ and Boogie,
um,
made up the rest of the team.

1153
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:15.740
So we had two guys,

1154
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:20.330
<v 0>a couple medium guys.
And then Gio is a small guy.
Geosys the smallest guy,</v>

1155
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:25.270
but he's like Ge.
It was like one 41 45.
He does when he fights one 35.
Right?

1156
01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:29.900
He walks around like one 40,
one 40.
So you,

1157
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.010
every team has to submit the order.
They want their fighters to go,

1158
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:37.880
but without knowing your opponent order.
So you,

1159
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:40.340
you just line them up however you want and then boom,

1160
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:43.730
they just banned this is the matchup,
like,
oh shit.
You know,
um,

1161
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.690
you could have giants against little dudes.
You know,
it's all mixed up.

1162
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.510
You just ban.
Does anybody have to agree?
Nope.

1163
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.910
So who gets to put the guy out first?

1164
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.850
Like when you're making the decisions now this is what happens.
You have to,

1165
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.360
every team has to submit the order that they want their,

1166
01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.900
their fighters to go out.
So I had no,
it's random.
So I say,
Eddie,

1167
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:05.960
you go out first.
Jamie goes out second riding down,
submit it,

1168
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:08.720
and they got sick and they just put them together.
That's ridiculous.

1169
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:10.670
You don't know how your,
your,
your opponents,

1170
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.190
the other team's going to line them up.
So boom,
when they line up,
when they,

1171
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.730
you see how it lined up,
you're like,
oh shit.

1172
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:21.500
So the craziest thing was we,
you know,
we had to beat,

1173
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.970
the first team we win against was,
um,

1174
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:30.560
issues team each.
She is the biggest,

1175
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:36.320
best built Japanese of all time of all times,

1176
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:40.670
like 250 pound Japanese,
like six foot three,
six foot four built.

1177
01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:45.040
Like Ray Lewis is easy to gold medalist.
Gold medalist in judo.
Yeah,

1178
01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.040
he's in dude.
He's so cool too.
The Guy,
he's awesome.
He's a,

1179
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:53.570
he's as English is pretty good and I'm just fight MMA a little bit.
Yeah.

1180
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:57.530
In Japan.
The dude is,
I've never seen a Japanese built like this motherfucker.

1181
01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:00.410
I've never,
he's like Brock fucking lesson,
our shit.
You know what I mean?

1182
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:04.160
It's insane.
He's,
he's a,
he's a very intimidating and giant.

1183
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.490
So that was the first time we were gone again.
So I go fuck.

1184
01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:11.750
We were like Holy Shit.
And plus that Xiao assists,
which is a big ass Brazilian.

1185
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:15.220
He's like 210 pounds.
One of the best Brazilian Jujitsu guys out then.

1186
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:17.390
He's not the Japanese team.
He's on issues team.

1187
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:22.310
So it's [inaudible] big high level world champion,

1188
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:25.880
Abu Dhabi champion.
He went to Abu Dhabi once to God and he,

1189
01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:29.780
she and then they had three other guys,
right.
So we had to go against them first.

1190
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.430
But,
but the first two teams that went while we're in the locker room,

1191
01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.090
soccer Robin's team when against Tiger Muay Thai team,
right.

1192
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:42.200
It was a steward Cooper's team.
So to each she up there,
Jesus Christ,

1193
01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:46.310
he's jacked like the size of him mad.
He's so fucking big.

1194
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.900
He's huge in person.
He's huge.
I'm sure man.
It's incredible.

1195
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.550
But rampage right?
Was that in Strikeforce?
Bella tour?

1196
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.370
He fought rampage and Bella tour.
So we're in the back.

1197
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:01.040
I wish I would have videotape their shit.
One in the back locker room.

1198
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:03.410
It's a nice arena and everything.
So it's like,
we're like at a,

1199
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:04.880
like a basketball arena.
We're in the,

1200
01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:09.120
in the back watching the first two guys go and soccer.

1201
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:14.040
Rob had this giant black guy on his team.
His name is Frida.
I think it's

1202
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.730
<v 3>Haseen Frieda,
um,</v>

1203
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:20.100
some black guy from Africa who lives in Japan and he trains a soccer rob at

1204
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.620
giant dude.
Right?
Tall motherfucker.

1205
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:27.980
So we're watching this black dude destroy everybody while we're in the locker

1206
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:33.540
room going,
Holy Shit.
This guy who's going to go against this dude,

1207
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:38.070
he's probably about 210,
215 pounds.

1208
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:43.080
Six foot four.
Haseen Frieda um,
this is the guy right here.
No,
no,
no,
no,

1209
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.250
no,
no.
The guy he's going to fight.
Yes.
Check.
Check out.
Check out this guy.

1210
01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:50.820
Shield in the hot scene.
Rida.
Yeah.
He just goes after legs and ripped.
He's tall,

1211
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:53.460
dude.
He fucks people up.
So we're,

1212
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.820
we're backstage watching this dude tear through.

1213
01:11:56.821 --> 01:12:01.530
That team is so much bigger than that guy.
Yeah,
totally.
That's so crazy.

1214
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.350
Yeah.
This is like a,
it looks like 150 pound guy versus a two o Fiverr.
Yeah.

1215
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:10.530
And the way,
the way it is,
right.
So if you win the first match up,
right,

1216
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:14.190
if there,
if there's not a submission,
it's submission only.

1217
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:18.270
If there's not a submission and time runs out,
both those fighters are out.

1218
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:23.160
It's whoever has the last fight or standing wins.
Right.
Oh Shit.
Look at this.

1219
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:25.500
He goes right for legs and just rip them off,
Dude.

1220
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:28.663
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:35.120
<v 3>Looking for the other one now.
So much bigger than him.
So dangerous.</v>

1222
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:41.270
He let it go quick.
So anyways,
we're backstage watching this guy.

1223
01:12:41.271 --> 01:12:44.720
He tapped out like three days.
Can we see from Kenya,

1224
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:49.100
maybe and Ghana,
Ghana and he trains over and download as well.
No,
no.

1225
01:12:49.101 --> 01:12:52.290
He lives in Japan.
He trains with uh,
somebody in Japan with soccer.

1226
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:56.450
Raba you've got much bigger.
Yeah.
That's so crazy.
You guys a normal guy.
Yeah.

1227
01:12:56.451 --> 01:13:00.470
So at least it didn't hurt him.
So,
so if you win that first match,

1228
01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:03.740
you got to understand this.
This is how it goes.
Okay?
If you,
if you win,

1229
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:08.720
you stay and you fight their second guy.
If you beat him again,

1230
01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:13.220
you stay and you fight their third guy to do the second or third guy already

1231
01:13:13.221 --> 01:13:16.640
fight.
Do they fight already?
Like you're not fighting a guy who hasn't fought.

1232
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:22.040
Are you fighting a guy?
No.
No,
no,
no,
no.
What happens is you win one five on five,

1233
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.420
right?
This,
this is the first matchup right here,
right?
This guy wins.
Okay?

1234
01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:30.390
So that guy's out.
This guy stays in.
We still got five guys.
Now they got bore.

1235
01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:33.290
This guy fights this guy.
He wins again.
He taps him,

1236
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:35.960
he stays and these guys haven't even fought yet.

1237
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.740
And then this guy is gonna fight the third guy that people are listening here.

1238
01:13:39.741 --> 01:13:43.950
You got your fingers in the air.
No one was coming down.
The camera is yes we can.

1239
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.010
So,
but if you tie,

1240
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.430
let's say you're in a matchup and you tie both you guys are out and then the

1241
01:13:49.431 --> 01:13:53.610
next fight or comes in.
So it's the last man standing and um,

1242
01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:57.890
interested.
So it's a good idea.
Like Geo one against easy,

1243
01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:01.950
our smallest guy when against the biggest guy on the Turner,
right?
Judo,

1244
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:04.040
Olympic Kamora of how,

1245
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:08.840
so the strategy was there with just survive against the student,

1246
01:14:08.841 --> 01:14:12.340
knock them out.
Don't let them win because if he beats GL,

1247
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.900
then he's gonna fight again.

1248
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:17.740
He's going to keep fighting until he loses or gets a d points.
How's it work?

1249
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:20.020
There's no points.
No submission.
Only submission.
Nolan.

1250
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.930
And how much time do you have?
Uh,
it's,

1251
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.580
I think it's eight minutes for regular matches,
but if it's a,

1252
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:29.850
if there's a weight difference that,
uh,

1253
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.360
like 40 pounds or more than it's a shorter match.
Okay.

1254
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:37.960
Now when it's four minutes went against each sheet.
Yes.

1255
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.900
Put on Gov Specie is she wasn't able to tap them,

1256
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.110
which is incredible when you really think about how much bigger he is.

1257
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:46.870
I mean he's a norm that it's the one after this one.

1258
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.780
It's this the one after this fight I saw,

1259
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:54.020
I saw Sakuraba and a Richie,
uh,

1260
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.920
who we keep calling boogie and this is Richie right here against,
wow.

1261
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.230
This is Richie.
He uh,

1262
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.650
both these guys they got dqued because there was no taps.

1263
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:06.050
A boogie had rubber guard all over and do it.
It looks scary.

1264
01:15:06.051 --> 01:15:09.960
So two or three times he got,
he got dqued as well.
They both happen.
Yeah,

1265
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:13.180
they both get dqued if there's no submission,
which is beautiful.

1266
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.510
It's a beautiful,
makes people go after things that both you guys are out.

1267
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.210
It's whoever has the last fighter.
When,
um,

1268
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.870
when I saw that soccer rabo was tapped out,
I was like,
who the fuck tapped out?

1269
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.520
Sakuraba and then as he got off him,
I saw it was Richie.
I texted him,

1270
01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:32.200
I was like,
what the fuck?
Look at this.
Is He,
she and a GL right is so crazy.

1271
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:34.900
This shit.
So it's all about GL is trying to attack them.

1272
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:37.750
See Geo when for a Kamora of his own because he's really good at Camorra's.

1273
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.090
So he was like,
fuck it,
I'm going to try to tap this guy out.

1274
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.240
But it got to a point where he was just too big and he was,

1275
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:47.650
he put a Kamora on GL and was just trying to rip his arm off.
Dude.

1276
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:51.940
He had jeels arm behind his back.
I saw it,
I saw it and I,

1277
01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:56.240
I talked to Geo after the fact.
Geo and Richie came to see me,
uh,

1278
01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:00.400
in Temecula when I did,
uh,
the casino down there for Tonga.
Yeah.

1279
01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.370
I talked to him about it afterwards.
Went to that is,
he's like,

1280
01:16:03.371 --> 01:16:07.180
you didn't have me.
I'm like,
that's crazy.
It's crazy.
He couldn't tap you.

1281
01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:09.700
He's so much bigger.
And when I saw them yanking on his arm,

1282
01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:12.790
it's terrifying to watch.
He's like thinking about all the damage.
It's doing it,

1283
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.740
that elbow and that shoulder.
Yup.

1284
01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.790
And he's trying to pass his guard and put a come moron.
You know,

1285
01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:19.030
he's got four minutes to do it.

1286
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.300
So we're all thinking it would be great if Geo could tap this guy,

1287
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:26.320
but at the very least,
knock him out.
You know what I mean?
Just survive.

1288
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.380
Cause who knows?
He could've cleaned,
he'd get it cleaned out the whole team.

1289
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:33.430
Look at this animal.
It's crazy.
This guy's a fucking monster.

1290
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:40.120
Yeah.
I mean he keeps yanking on it too.
It's just amazing.

1291
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:41.830
It gets crazy right here.

1292
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:51.460
We're watching it,
right?
Boom.
Look at that.
Look at that.

1293
01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:56.440
Most people would have tapped right there a tapped look at that shit.

1294
01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.820
Look at that.
Boom.
Now he's good.
He got the hand down to the mat.
Luckily,

1295
01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:04.660
he's so good at Camorra's that he's created so many Kamora monsters down at a

1296
01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:07.260
school that he has to deal with gun wars all the time.

1297
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:10.790
So that's why he was able to survive.
Look how he's getting his knees in.

1298
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:15.740
See how he's,
he just creating space,
talking in again.
Yeah.
Amazing people who,
uh,

1299
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:19.700
have never practiced you just who probably wouldn't appreciate how interesting

1300
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:23.180
this technique that he has it on again.
So dangerous for him to do this,

1301
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:26.540
to be stuck in a situation and to see she give up on it.

1302
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.040
That's what's even more crazy.
Cause he,
she is literally a hundred pounds bigger.

1303
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:32.030
He's going to go back to it.
He's going to go back to it.

1304
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.070
But I mean he gave up on it right there though.
Yeah.

1305
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.090
I mean he's so much bigger than them.
It's really,
it's sane.

1306
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.600
So because of the fact there was no tap and this one,

1307
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:45.750
both guys get knocked out as a how it goes.
We win there.
You know what I mean?

1308
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.850
I took out a monster out the big gorilla.
Yeah.
Um,
so,

1309
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.313
uh,

1310
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.800
we win the first round and then we end up going against soccer robis team in the

1311
01:17:57.231 --> 01:18:00.840
finals because they beat a tighter muy Thai team.
Uh,

1312
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:03.710
so now haseen Frieda

1313
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.280
boogie taps out Sakharova he puts soccer Robyn and had Doris,

1314
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:14.300
Doris and then he goes against,
he stays because he wins.

1315
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.200
So he stays and he goes against Frieda and Frieda taps out book.

1316
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.850
What did catch him with?
He got him with an arm bar and right there jeels next.

1317
01:18:22.851 --> 01:18:26.910
Now right here.
Here it is.
Yeah,
this is it.
This is where he gets buggy,

1318
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.060
but boom.

1319
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:32.630
So now he stays and jeels next and he's just on fire.

1320
01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:36.150
He's ripping through everybody.
And within a minute and how big is,
he said,

1321
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.210
I just let her roll through here.
Let this role,

1322
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.260
how big is he now it's like a g a,
he's about like six,
three,
six,

1323
01:18:42.261 --> 01:18:46.580
four tall.
I'm on the fuck to talk to 20 to 10 in that area.

1324
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.900
So now look at,
this is GL against.
So I told Jill,
I said,
I looked at him,
I said,

1325
01:18:50.901 --> 01:18:55.550
dude,
to avenge your brother's loss.
I went fucking Kung,

1326
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:59.420
cause I'm losing my mind.
I'm like,
Oh shit.

1327
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:04.070
And and Geo is the final match.
No,
no,
no.
This is like right in the middle.

1328
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:06.200
Now it's like there's three guys left each.

1329
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.860
I don't understand there's this whole thing works,
but it's kind of confusing.

1330
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:10.670
But once you,

1331
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:15.670
once you stay in until you either lose or get 'em or at the draw if you lose or

1332
01:19:17.071 --> 01:19:20.990
to draw,
you're both out.
Um,
but if you win with a submission,

1333
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:23.750
you stay and you fight the next guy.
One guy could,

1334
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:28.520
could take out a whole team and you know,

1335
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.950
um,
the winning team might have guys that did immediately attack,

1336
01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:35.840
like he's attacking.
Check is,
it doesn't last long.
So he's so tall,

1337
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:41.120
he gls got one of the best guillotines in the system here.
Look,
boom.

1338
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.890
He gets him right there before he stood up.

1339
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:44.900
There was no way he would have been able to catch that front head lock.

1340
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:47.180
And that's exactly what we're talking about.
Once you have a front headlock,

1341
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:50.510
the Lil Nigga this,
he goes,
Marcella teen on him.
Boom.
All Marcella right here.

1342
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:55.460
Check this out.
Boom.
Bam.
Right there.
Marcel is incredible,
man.

1343
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.110
That is amazing.
That is an amazing kitty.

1344
01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.370
That 140 pound dude,
look at the tap out the elite high level,

1345
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.340
210 pound dude like that.
That's incredible.

1346
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.220
Maybe more than two 10.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
So Dude,

1347
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:22.050
I'm on the side.
Losing my mind in my head almost exploded.
That's incredible.

1348
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:25.740
So now GL stays and he goes against it.
Look at that size difference.

1349
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:30.020
Look that shit,
guillotine,
guillotine that,
and if you want to,

1350
01:20:30.021 --> 01:20:35.021
the only way he was he could guillotine him was by almost sweeping them,

1351
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.920
getting them on his butt,
and before he could stand up Cios,

1352
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.550
he jumped on that head and arm boom,
and he sprawled them down,

1353
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:45.840
snapped him down and turned it into a Marcella team.
Insane in Saint Louis too.

1354
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:50.640
It's like,
oh no,
he thought it was going to be easy.
That's one to,

1355
01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:52.590
one of the more interesting things about Jujitsu,

1356
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.600
Jujitsu is an art where a smaller person with technique really can't be a bigger

1357
01:20:57.601 --> 01:21:01.590
person.
And just Marcella teens are giant killers.
That's why it's in the,

1358
01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:05.370
we warm up with that shit,
dude.
We don't fuck around.
I mean I,

1359
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:09.600
I don't know how many times you need to see Mark Marcella Garcia rip people

1360
01:21:09.601 --> 01:21:13.650
apart with those things before you put it into your,
your own system.

1361
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.540
That's amazing.
So when is this event can happen again?
So we won this one.

1362
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:23.220
It was super fucking crazy.
We won this one and um,
uh,

1363
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.670
that was quintet to quintet three.
Uh,

1364
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.700
we're returning and w that's going to be in Vegas the Friday before Conor versus

1365
01:21:33.141 --> 01:21:36.990
could beep oh,
so it's going to be a crazy weekend song.

1366
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:41.970
They won the first quintet and they got Craig Jones.
They got Marcin.

1367
01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:43.710
How's that team Polaris,

1368
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.480
I mean Craig Jones is one of the best grapplers in the world right now.
And um,

1369
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:52.610
that's it.
Quintet.
I watched his match with who some are porous.

1370
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:56.610
Uriah Faber got a team now.
Oh Shit.
There's geo boom.

1371
01:21:57.170 --> 01:22:00.570
Interesting.
And the Craig Jones,
that's fucking team.

1372
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:02.300
Polaris was quintet one winter too.

1373
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:06.090
It's really nice to see more people paying attention to submission grappling.

1374
01:22:06.091 --> 01:22:08.500
Maybe this is the way to do it.
This is your,
this is dude,

1375
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.690
this is lighting the world on the grappling world,
on fire.

1376
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:15.960
Every one starting their own quintet rules as a new thing.
Now.

1377
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.453
They've already been,

1378
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:21.240
that happened to a month and half ago and they've already been tournaments.

1379
01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.530
Quit Blue Belt Quintet Tournament.
Like we're having a quintet tournament.

1380
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.470
At the 10th planet eclipse,

1381
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.740
which is what we all get together once a year and have a party and you know,

1382
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.810
um,
and uh,

1383
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:38.280
do business stuff like a business summit meeting is founded by Josh Barnett.

1384
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:42.120
Is that what you're saying?
He's in it.
John.
John Edson it,
he had,

1385
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:45.310
he was in the first one,
but it's a Sakharova shame.
No.

1386
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:47.190
Quintec three card will feature soccer.

1387
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:50.400
Rob Himself in action along with fell UFC hall of Famer,
Uriah Faber,

1388
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.140
former UFC heavyweight champion,

1389
01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:54.960
Josh Barnett and elite glass grappling champions,

1390
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:59.970
including three times Ebi winner,
Geo motherfucking Martinez and raining campy,

1391
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.060
I guess Josh Byrne had it would be in this one.
Craig Jones.
That's awesome man.

1392
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.280
Maybe he's not,
maybe he's on soccer,
Robin's team or something.

1393
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.270
<v 1>I don't know.
You know what man,</v>

1394
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:11.300
he's like real ambivalent about his is not ambivalent,
but you know,

1395
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.990
he's just trying to figure out what he's going to do with his career.

1396
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:18.530
He's been released by the UFC.
You know,
he had that whole Usada thing where,
um,

1397
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.900
it was a,
they flagged him for,
was it a tainted supplement?

1398
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:25.840
He went over the whole story on the podcast.
It was a tainted supplement.

1399
01:23:25.841 --> 01:23:28.510
They proved it was a tainted supplement.
Um,

1400
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:33.550
they released him but it took a long time to do so and he was very frustrated by

1401
01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:34.840
it and now he's not sure what he's going to do.

1402
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.460
So for him to do something like this,
you know,

1403
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.700
especially like at this stage of his career,

1404
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:42.370
like Josh is still an elite grappler.
Absolutely.

1405
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.880
One the worlds in the g tap dean lister out.

1406
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:50.660
Remember that tap dean lister out with a cat was account.
No,
no,
it was a scarf.

1407
01:23:50.661 --> 01:23:53.440
Hold scarf,
hold show,
forget.
I forget.
Yeah,

1408
01:23:53.441 --> 01:23:56.800
it was like a one of them judo side.
Headlock chokes.

1409
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.560
I mean tapped out here on Grayson.
I mean he had,

1410
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.020
he had a lot of weight on them but still he's still got them.

1411
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:05.860
The Dean lister one is,
both of them are incredibly impressive,

1412
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:08.170
but the dean lister is a big guy.

1413
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:12.940
You know dean lister and him are of similar size.
Yeah.
So he got him in,

1414
01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:16.090
he got him inside control and then he went to like one of those.

1415
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:20.380
Remember when Mark Coleman tapped out,
Dan Severn the front of that.
It's like a,

1416
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:21.990
just a regular school start.

1417
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:27.010
Hold the headlock I got put in a headlock ones is as a kid for being an asshole.

1418
01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:31.090
I couldn't get out.
I couldn't get out man.

1419
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:33.880
You realize how fucking good Josh is though.

1420
01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.560
When you see him control a guy like dean lister,
I mean that's how God damn good.

1421
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:42.520
That's according to be quarter.
Nelson record is pop off.
These shameless popups.

1422
01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:46.720
These wants done with it.
Someone screen recorded.
Oh,
someone's screen in cornea.

1423
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.840
That was a shameless pop on.
All right,
we're good.
Um,

1424
01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.750
so that's fucking interesting.
Who else is on the car this weekend?

1425
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:56.020
Pull up the UFC card this weekend.
So it was Darren tail versus Tyron Woodley.

1426
01:24:56.021 --> 01:25:00.310
I'm very excited by that fight.
We look,
Darren till is a really,

1427
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:03.580
really high level striker.
Like the way he moves way he sets things up,

1428
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:07.780
the strategies.
He does fight with his chin up in the air though.

1429
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:11.470
And he does fight with his hands down low,
but it's to invite in brawls.

1430
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.000
Um,
so who else we got?
We got,
oh,

1431
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:21.340
Montana and voluntariness shift.
Chanko Woo.
The beat is fighting.

1432
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.750
Oh Shit.
Well up beat was supposed to be fighting Yahya Rodriguez,

1433
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.270
but Yahya Rodriguez got injured.

1434
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.630
So Brandon Davis took it on real short notice,

1435
01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:33.430
I think like less than three weeks notice.

1436
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:37.830
And that's going to be a good fight,
right?
Yeah.

1437
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:42.820
Jessica and dried it.
Probably had the biggest arms in the women's division.

1438
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:47.410
She least do.
Those arms are incredible.
Yeah.

1439
01:25:47.411 --> 01:25:49.120
I'm really excited about tilling Woodley.

1440
01:25:49.121 --> 01:25:53.080
That's the fight that's most interesting to me.
That one to me it's like,
ah,

1441
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:57.310
I watched that.
The Woodley till highlights and I'm like,

1442
01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.220
I don't know man.
I'm real interested about this because what,

1443
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:05.310
what till brings to the game is a size and height and distance and striking.

1444
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:07.520
But what Tyron Woodley,

1445
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:11.420
[inaudible] Woodley also has wrestling also his championship experience.

1446
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:15.520
Been there,
done that
tils favorite?
Yeah,

1447
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.030
one 45 to one 25 I never understood that.

1448
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:24.650
How can they both be slightly above a hundred last to do with the money,

1449
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:27.470
but yeah,
I know,
but I mean still like wait a minute.

1450
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:32.210
So if you know one of them's,
you bet a hundred you went in one and a half,

1451
01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:34.730
but the other one is also favorite.

1452
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:40.090
No one 25 I mean one 25 so that you,

1453
01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:41.870
so okay,
so what it is,

1454
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:46.871
is Darren tills favorite by one 45 like if you bet a hundred you wouldn't one 45

1455
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:51.380
that means you have to pay a hundred.
If you win a hundred,
right?

1456
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:56.530
You have to pay one 45 to 100 where if you bet a hundred you wouldn't one 25 on

1457
01:26:57.471 --> 01:27:01.130
Woodley who is the champion.
Correct.
That has really just like if you bet now,

1458
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.010
because this will change probably by all the way up to time to fight starts

1459
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.780
normally and I stand this marijuana don't understand it.
I understand it,

1460
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:12.020
but we smoked too much pot before this show.
The um,

1461
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.800
the thing that's interesting to me is that he,
he doesn't,

1462
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:20.240
I don't understand why they would have him a favorite unless there's a lot of

1463
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:22.580
money coming in from Liverpool.
Literally would just what it is.

1464
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:27.490
It's just attending favor.
It's not like this isn't saying the fair for the site.

1465
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:31.270
Just like there should be an expert line.
I go,

1466
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.240
I wonder what the expert line would be because he like,

1467
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.520
if I didn't work for the UFC,
if I'm standing here and you say,
what do you,

1468
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:38.660
who do you think wins his fight?

1469
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.410
I'd have to step back if I was like working for a casino,

1470
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:45.200
if they hired me as a consultant,
I'd say this is a pick him fight.

1471
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.670
Anything can happen in this fight.

1472
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.850
There's no way I know what's going to happen in this fight.
Like the vow,

1473
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.910
here's what fight Valentina Shevchenko and Nico Montana,

1474
01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:57.060
that that fight should be like 1200 to one.
That's pretty much what it is.

1475
01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.190
It 1600 1600 okay,
well I'm being conservative.

1476
01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:05.150
Another other one is on drought or uh,
just the beat is minus 1200 yeah,

1477
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:09.720
that makes sense to those two.
Make Sense.
See this one to me is like,
hmm.

1478
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.660
I don't know.
I really do not know.
That's,

1479
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:16.280
that is very much like pick them territory.
You could even have it.

1480
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:17.900
Like it could be plus one 10 plus.

1481
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:21.980
So this could vary depending upon like we'll late Woodley money could come in or

1482
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:25.220
late til money could shifted even higher.
I think some,
I don't know,

1483
01:28:25.221 --> 01:28:27.460
depending on how much is really on it,
someone could change that part.

1484
01:28:27.461 --> 01:28:30.010
I like a $10,000 bet they could flip it or something like that.

1485
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:33.290
It depends on how much is currently writing.
It's a,

1486
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.040
it's a very interesting fight.
I think.
Um,

1487
01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.470
one factor is going to be kicks and I think you will,

1488
01:28:39.471 --> 01:28:43.370
you're going to see is tilled doing a lot of what he did in the Wonderboy fight,

1489
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:47.180
which is a attack that lead leg with the front leg side kick.

1490
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.960
He does that a lot and it's a,

1491
01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.880
it's an awful kick if you get hit with it.

1492
01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:57.200
Hyper extends your knee and um,
he does it really well.

1493
01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:01.800
It's a real controversial kick.
I mean,
I don't know really it should be,

1494
01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:05.010
if it's legal to grab your leg in a heel hook and rip it apart.

1495
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:06.750
Why isn't it legal?
The side kick your leg.

1496
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.660
I mean I don't think it's dirty at all.
The thing is that you can't,

1497
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:13.530
the idea is that you can't tap from it Darren till a profit back from the
pisser.

1498
01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.630
Uh,
Darren till is a,
he's known for this.
Uh,
in the,

1499
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.750
in the wonder why Friday through these hard front lake side kicks to the knee

1500
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.080
just like Robert Whitaker did to Yoel Romero and just like Yoel Romero did to

1501
01:29:25.081 --> 01:29:28.560
him and a previous fight like that front leg side kick to the knee is become a

1502
01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:30.890
big kick and tells really good at it.

1503
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.750
I think that's going to be a big factor in this fight is distance.

1504
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:36.720
Like if till can keep his distance and uses reach,

1505
01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:42.210
you know cause it says that the same reach but that doesn't make any sense but

1506
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.950
doesn't one of them is taller you mean it's just like yeah maybe the arm

1507
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:51.951
distance is the same but as Woodley generally counter fight as he generally kind

1508
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:56.070
of stepping back.
I mean is he going to want to be done a lot of that?

1509
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.310
He does a lot of that.
He's really good at countering a heel.

1510
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:03.750
He lets himself almost get pushed back to the cage and then launch launches

1511
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:08.660
forward.
If you watch like when he Kao Josh Koscheck what he does,
he would let,

1512
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.460
he almost let guys press him up against the cage and they expose themselves and

1513
01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:13.350
the need tax back.

1514
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:17.910
Rory Macdonald figured out a way to nullify that he was the like,

1515
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:21.510
but that was also a different Tyron Woodley cause I was tired of Willie before

1516
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:24.720
Duke Roufus see most people don't realize that even though Tyler and Rudy was

1517
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:28.290
like world class one of the best welterweights on the planet,

1518
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:31.300
he was really kind of training himself who's working with different people all

1519
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:33.450
over the country.
But he didn't have a main head coach.

1520
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:36.750
He didn't get one until he started training with two goofus.

1521
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.280
So from Duke Roufus on,
it's like you're looking at a different fighter.

1522
01:30:41.281 --> 01:30:45.210
He's much better at like relaxing,
conserving his energy.

1523
01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:48.840
He doesn't get tired in the later rounds anymore.
He's much more effective.

1524
01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:52.050
And he also knows not to get sucked in by the crowd.

1525
01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:55.410
Like in the Wonderboy fights in particular,
like people were saying it's boring,

1526
01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:58.560
but you have to fight Wonderboy.
That way you can't charge at them.

1527
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.630
If you charge it wonderful,
you get lit up,

1528
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:02.690
you get lit up with these crazy counterstrikes.

1529
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:04.560
You got to wait for Wonderboy to lead.

1530
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.790
And Wonderboy was leading and Tyron still again,

1531
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:11.880
Wonderboy landed more shots,
but Tyron hurt him way more.

1532
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:14.400
How do the Kelvin gasoline them fight?
Go with Woodley.

1533
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:18.420
It was a split decision beat Calvin by decision.
It was,
you know,
pretty,

1534
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.810
pretty close fight.
But Calvin,
that was the fight.

1535
01:31:20.811 --> 01:31:23.640
We're Kelvin didn't make weight.
He was all fucked up coming into that fight,

1536
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.450
but a Woodley one.
But that was also,
uh,

1537
01:31:26.451 --> 01:31:30.420
want to say that was like right when he started with Duke or maybe start with

1538
01:31:30.421 --> 01:31:32.940
Duke after that.
Um,

1539
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.960
either way you look a little like the Robbie Lawler fight is a good example.

1540
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.980
What he can do,

1541
01:31:37.981 --> 01:31:42.981
what would we can do is put the best guys in the world out with one shot guys

1542
01:31:43.171 --> 01:31:46.020
who nobody puts out.
Who the fuck puts out Robbie Lawler.

1543
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:51.030
Robbie Lawler gets hit with bombs and survives and Tyron Woodley put one on him,

1544
01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.073
knocked him out.

1545
01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.320
I mean he can do that to anybody and he could do that to Darren till two.

1546
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:59.350
I mean if Darren till doesn't think that coming into this fight because he's the

1547
01:31:59.351 --> 01:32:02.410
more accomplished Stryker.
It's a very dangerous fight for them.

1548
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:07.360
Woodley so fucking fast.
But then again Darren till can find his rhythm,

1549
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:12.070
establishes distance and start using those kicks in particular that front leg

1550
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:12.791
side kick man,

1551
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:16.450
he fucks your leg up with that and then his leg kicks and then his leg kicks

1552
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:18.670
with combinations and he also,

1553
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:23.290
he's real creative with his striking.
There's a lot of hand movement.

1554
01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:24.970
There's a lot to distract you.

1555
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.120
Maybe Woodley's best strategy would be to just take him down over and over again

1556
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:35.200
and try to mount them and try to take us back and and trying to do some ground

1557
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:39.730
and Parallon.
Look man,
he's a stress test to take down.
I don't know.

1558
01:32:39.731 --> 01:32:43.300
It's a good question.
And how,
how is he on his back?
That's a good question too.

1559
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:45.760
You know what we know about him is he likes a strike.

1560
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:49.290
Big Tall Dude likes to strike nasty striker.
You know,

1561
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.570
one of the more impressive things that he did is not the knockout of cowboy,

1562
01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.160
but when he hit him with that elbow,

1563
01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.600
he hit him with his step in elbow where I was like,
Jesus,
the speed of it man.

1564
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:01.510
It's like the,
the smoothness of his closing,

1565
01:33:01.511 --> 01:33:03.970
the distance and the speed of landing that elbow.

1566
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:07.900
Like he showed cowboy different distances and then he,
he like,

1567
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.830
he left this opening for that elbow and he slides in and cracks him with it and

1568
01:33:11.831 --> 01:33:14.620
you're like,
oh Jesus.
Like here's him against cowboy.

1569
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:17.500
Like see how his hands are down low.

1570
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:22.450
He's got a lot of movement of his hands but the like that jab comes up from the

1571
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:27.070
bottom,
comes from like underneath.
You don't know like until it's too late,

1572
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.890
whether he's just probe a new or whether he's punching you.

1573
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.050
There's a lot of that,
see a lot of that with the hands

1574
01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:35.400
and he keeps his chin straight up in the air,

1575
01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:37.890
but he also is really good at moving his head back.

1576
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.180
He's also really used to high level sparring and high level fighting.

1577
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:44.400
He's an elite guy man,

1578
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:48.300
and a dangerous kind of weird style and a lot of ways.

1579
01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:50.170
There's a lot,

1580
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:54.880
see all that hand movement and Shit like he does a lot of that shit that you saw

1581
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:59.320
on Bruce Lee movies.
Yeah.
Well watching.

1582
01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:02.980
Look at this boom to the body.
I mean that's,
that's nasty,
right?

1583
01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:06.220
Like you start thinking it's coming over the top and it comes to the body.

1584
01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:11.210
Have you heard another loranges impersonation of,

1585
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:13.970
of done until it's hilarious.

1586
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:18.970
You know and I though it was fucking talented.
God Man,
he's a talented guy.

1587
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:22.700
The,
the MMA world is lucky that we have him.

1588
01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:24.463
It's fucking,

1589
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:28.970
it was talk about like hilarious inside shit in the world of Jujitsu and MMA,

1590
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:32.990
like his fake feud with Vinnie Mag.
Allays is hilarious.

1591
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:38.540
That's a real feud,
man.
They hate each other and trust.
We're on,

1592
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:40.810
we're on a group text me Vinny and not,

1593
01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:46.210
and they're just constantly fucking tearing each other apart constantly.

1594
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:49.910
That's hilarious.
They hate each other.
That's so funny,
man.

1595
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:55.610
V Vinnie Mongolia is doing good.
He's doing great,
but what does that Pfl yeah,

1596
01:34:55.611 --> 01:34:58.940
having a watching that.
Yeah.
I watched fight.
He won by head kick,
knock out.

1597
01:34:58.941 --> 01:34:59.990
I was like,
Oh shit.

1598
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:04.040
All of a sudden you got to worry about his head kick is that may be his third

1599
01:35:04.041 --> 01:35:06.260
head kick knock out.
Well you definitely have to worry about it.

1600
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:10.510
And his Jujitsu is top of the food chains and now he's like really into it and

1601
01:35:10.511 --> 01:35:13.460
wanting to throw it,
wanting to set it up more.
There's being,

1602
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:17.870
being hits him with that left hand.
Watch this
boom.

1603
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:23.030
And then as he closes in,
wash his elbow,
he's closing.
Dang right there.

1604
01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.020
Ooh,
that's so nasty.
That is a fucking hard elbow man.

1605
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:29.900
Does he remind you of Connor a little bit?
The way he kind of stands.

1606
01:35:29.901 --> 01:35:32.060
It seems like they kind of have that same style.
Well,

1607
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:36.590
they have a similar style and that they have their hands spread apart and you

1608
01:35:36.591 --> 01:35:40.580
know,
constantly fainting and lot of bouncing up and down and back and forth.

1609
01:35:40.581 --> 01:35:43.640
A lot of movement.
Yeah.
He's not unlike a plotting guy.

1610
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:46.410
What did he do it on his feet?
Did he do karate growing up or something?

1611
01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.970
Like a lot of more times he was a kid,
very young.

1612
01:35:49.971 --> 01:35:53.780
I'd have to ask Vinny shoreman the full,
uh,
full background of him.
But you know,

1613
01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:54.614
Vinny,

1614
01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:59.150
Vinny was one of the ones who told me about them like a long time ago and told

1615
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:01.310
me about him when he's first fight in the UFC.
He's like,

1616
01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:04.100
you gotta Watch this guy.
He's fucking special.
And he said,
uh,

1617
01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:08.210
you know his Liverpool accident cause finished from Liverpool to,
he said,
uh,

1618
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.380
when the cowboy fight was going on,
he's like,

1619
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.770
cowboy doesn't know what he's in for.

1620
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.350
Like he thinks he's just going to go in there and fight this guy and doesn't

1621
01:36:15.351 --> 01:36:16.460
need to watch tape on him.

1622
01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:20.780
Like you have no idea where you're dealing with what's cowboy a hundred percent

1623
01:36:20.781 --> 01:36:24.430
and that fight.
Did he have some weight cutting issues?

1624
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:28.250
One 70 and it was one 70 to be trained properly for that fight.
I mean,

1625
01:36:28.251 --> 01:36:31.820
I assume he did.
He's not saying,
oh now I don't know.
You know,
it's just,

1626
01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:36.050
I think cowboy honestly as a one 50 fiver or one 60 fiber,
you know,

1627
01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.510
I think there's a lot of fighters that are like that.
I mean,

1628
01:36:38.511 --> 01:36:42.260
I think cowboy can beat real top guys like Matt Brown.

1629
01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:45.680
He'd be beat Matt Brown at one and he got beat guys at one 70 no doubt.

1630
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:50.360
But I just think the re realistically these guys at one 70 are so fucking big

1631
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:53.480
that cowboys more of a one 55 or,
yeah.

1632
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:57.050
But I think that even one 55 hurts them,
hurts him to get down there.

1633
01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:00.530
So He's a tweener,
you know,
like Diego Sanchez always been kind of a tweener,

1634
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.740
you know,
it's like too small for one seven eight too big for one 55 yeah.

1635
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:08.240
You know,
but Diego made it down to one 45 once.
That's crazy.

1636
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:12.950
That doesn't sane.
That's that iron will son Bj to,

1637
01:37:12.951 --> 01:37:16.950
he did it on 71 55 one 45 I did heavyweight.

1638
01:37:16.951 --> 01:37:19.280
Remember we thought Leo Machida machine.

1639
01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.710
It was like two oh five and Bj just ate whatever the fuck he wanted.

1640
01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:26.660
I didn't even step on a scale,
be chased back.

1641
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:31.460
He's gonna Fight Ryan Hall.
That's going to be interesting.
That's whole fight.

1642
01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.440
That's good fight because Ryan Hall,
although he's got good kicks and he's,

1643
01:37:35.441 --> 01:37:38.060
he's good at keeping guys in the outside.
He's very smart.

1644
01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:40.010
It using his kicks to set up his Jujitsu.

1645
01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:43.490
You know people who had criticized it got a lot to Yup,
he does.

1646
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:46.730
That's an interesting fight.
That's that.
You know,

1647
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:50.240
you don't want to see like the higher would drag.
This one was tough to watch.

1648
01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:51.950
Yeah.
Cause you're watching Bj fight.

1649
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.980
A young guy who has a specialty that's like not in Bj's wheelhouse.

1650
01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.280
Like Bj's never been really a kicker.

1651
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.840
You know like he kicked Diego Sanchez and the head remember open up that big
cut.

1652
01:38:03.841 --> 01:38:07.290
It was like one of the only head kicks you ever saw Bj throw in his whole
career.

1653
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.100
Bj has been more punching in wrestling and Jujitsu,

1654
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.290
but he's fun.
Yeah.

1655
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:17.430
Ear like your ears like him and Zach beat like that.

1656
01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:22.320
Those tall guys with crazy kicks.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Those are so hard to deal with man.

1657
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.950
And Bj just,
it was the wrong fight for them.
It's just not a good fight.

1658
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.220
Didn't make any sense.
It's hard to watch.
Watch,

1659
01:38:29.221 --> 01:38:31.620
watch him get three 60 roundhouse kicked in the head.
You're like,

1660
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.560
oh yeah,
yeah.
Years striking is just,

1661
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:39.570
that's why I'm so bummed out that he got hurt.

1662
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:44.910
Yogurt versus a beat would have been crazy.
That would have been crazy.

1663
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.490
That's the probably the craziest striking match up.
I'm being,

1664
01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:52.650
well real mean one of crazier strikes than yeah,
year.

1665
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:56.550
Nobody is on beat.
Can throw all that same shit.
Yeah.
But yeah,

1666
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:59.060
you're just cartwheel kicks

1667
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:05.340
consistently at a high frequency.
Just keeps telling him.

1668
01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.750
Yeah,
it's incredible.
The thing about him though,
it was a,

1669
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:11.850
like when you watch the Frankie Edgar fight,
you're like,
hmm,
okay,

1670
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:15.090
that can be shut down.
Like that can be really shut down.

1671
01:39:15.091 --> 01:39:17.250
Like he didn't have an answer when it was shut down.
So He's,

1672
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.670
which means in my mind that his game is so heavily favored,

1673
01:39:20.671 --> 01:39:24.720
that looseness openness and kicking ass kicking crazy,
uh,
you know,

1674
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:28.500
wild kicking that he,
it's,
it's imbalanced,
right?

1675
01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:31.740
In the sense that he's got to put almost the same amount of effort to fighting

1676
01:39:31.741 --> 01:39:35.780
off of his back.
If he put the,
if he developed a,

1677
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:40.530
an unbelievable guard game,
the match has unbelievable kicking game.

1678
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.160
Holy Shit mean then you'd have an incredible balance messing around.

1679
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:46.500
Rubber going,
I better yet you should look,

1680
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:51.140
it makes sense when you the best,
the best kickers.
Like,

1681
01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.700
like that's one of the things that pedis is realizing now.

1682
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:58.440
Pedis has kind of stopped concentrating so much on wrestling and he said,

1683
01:39:58.441 --> 01:40:01.740
what I got to get back to doing is fighting.
And when I'm at my best,

1684
01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:05.310
he was saying is using his striking.
And then when it goes to the ground,

1685
01:40:05.311 --> 01:40:07.740
trying to submit,
people don't try to stop,
take downs,

1686
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.380
don't try to take people down.
Forget all that.

1687
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.900
So he's going back to what got him there.
You think about like,

1688
01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:17.100
is Benson Henderson fight won by arm bar?
I mean,
uh,
Gilbert Melendez,

1689
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:20.370
fi wins by Ikea teen takes,

1690
01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:24.630
takes his time on the feet,
does all his creative shit on the feet.

1691
01:40:24.631 --> 01:40:27.870
But if someone takes him down,
he tried to submit him,
immediately jumps on shit.

1692
01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:32.310
I think that's the,
that's a,
an interesting combination,
you know,

1693
01:40:32.311 --> 01:40:34.860
that's why I'm so interested in that fight with him and Tony because Tony so

1694
01:40:34.861 --> 01:40:38.450
wild.
Yeah.
Tony does the same thing.
The one thing you got to watch,

1695
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.360
watch out with Tony's.
Uh,

1696
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:47.810
he has so much firepower from so many different angles on the ground,

1697
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.650
but I mean,
he,
he knows,
he knows a lot,
a lot.

1698
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.070
There's much he could

1699
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.903
<v 3>tap you with,</v>

1700
01:40:55.210 --> 01:41:00.210
but his Darce game is so high level and he could get it from so many angles that

1701
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:06.610
really,
I think the most dangerous thing would be,
uh,
you know,

1702
01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:10.000
our guys that are just focused on one thing.

1703
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.320
And especially since he hits those Darcis from every goddamn angle,
you know,

1704
01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:18.100
if he came out and just said,
whatever happens,
we're always looking for the dark.

1705
01:41:18.101 --> 01:41:21.540
He was in trouble in that,
uh,
Lando Vanatta fight and boom,

1706
01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.530
you just put them in a Darson that saved the day.
You know what I mean?

1707
01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:26.190
So there's,

1708
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:30.460
there's a lot of different ways Tony could make you tap on the ground.
Trust me,

1709
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:34.330
he knows so much,
but man,

1710
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:37.120
if he just stuck with is Doris game,
man,

1711
01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:41.200
that's probably the most dangerous way to go on the ground.
You know,

1712
01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:46.230
it's an interesting fine man.
Interesting fight.
You know,
pet,

1713
01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:51.090
this is a nasty kicker.
There's a lot of great things in that fight.
Yeah,

1714
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.100
that's a good one.
Yeah,
that's not,
that's on that card.
That card.

1715
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:59.420
Is that on the same card?
It's on copy.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
What else is on that car?

1716
01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.370
Pull up that Conor Khabib card.
Who else was fighting on that card?
Do you know?

1717
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.060
It's only a month away.
I don't know.
It's not top of my head.
I know.

1718
01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:10.690
Sugar shut up.
You put up the,
yeah,

1719
01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.050
I like Sean O'malley fights in the main event.
He's a fun dude.
Man.

1720
01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:19.240
Had them in here.
We got barbecued separate.
Oh,
Derrick.
Derrick Lewis.

1721
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:24.700
Alexander Volkov.
Oh,
that's an interesting fight.

1722
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.710
That Volkov guy might be the dark horse.

1723
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:32.020
He might be the guy in the heavyweight division waiting in the wings,
you know,

1724
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:36.250
karate hottie versus Felicia is going to be good.
Oh,
mount.
Yeah,

1725
01:42:36.251 --> 01:42:40.890
that's a good one.
Um,
yeah,
I'm,

1726
01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:45.070
I'm interested in the Ferguson fight for sure.
The pedes Ferguson fight,

1727
01:42:45.071 --> 01:42:49.750
but I telling you that this is back Louis Volkov fight,
man.
That one.
I'm like,

1728
01:42:49.751 --> 01:42:54.010
Huh?
That Volkov Guy.
Did you see what he did it for a reseal for doom.

1729
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:59.240
When you watched that fight,
you go,
oh Jesus Christ.
I in fact I could do that.
He,

1730
01:42:59.241 --> 01:43:01.130
he,
he stopped for breezy over doom.

1731
01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:03.010
He'd beat the shit out of him before he stopped him.

1732
01:43:03.011 --> 01:43:07.930
Who's the Russian guy who puts dudes in Ezekiel choke while he's being mounted?

1733
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:12.240
Who's that?
Duly Nick.
Right back guys pulling nick mounted.

1734
01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.410
Zeke you'll students everywhere from why he's being mounted.

1735
01:43:16.411 --> 01:43:18.880
And John Jack does that too.
That is so crazy.

1736
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:23.920
But to do that in MMA with the gloves on,
it's like an unheard of.
Unbelievable.

1737
01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.690
While being mounted,
putting people to sleep.
That's just like,

1738
01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:30.190
what do you think you're ever gonna see that again?

1739
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:34.660
I think he has the ability to do it.
No,
but I mean from other people.

1740
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:39.750
Do you think that would be something that he just start adopting if fighters put

1741
01:43:40.421 --> 01:43:44.200
the time in,
you know all submissions or are possible.

1742
01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:47.080
You just got to put a lot of time at it.
You got to get obsessed with it.

1743
01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.190
It's like,
wow,
ooh.
What are the odds of that one working a lot.
One

1744
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.230
<v 1>guy's been able to pull it off.
Who else has been in what?</v>

1745
01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:58.560
He does it multiple times.
I've seen him do it twice.
Yeah,
twice.
I've seen it.

1746
01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.170
I've,
I haven't seen the third one,

1747
01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:03.550
but I've seen two of them standing gear in chokes.

1748
01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:08.270
So who got a standing gear teen?
This is a five minute compilation of,

1749
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.500
I don't know.
There's a lot of them.
Oh,
standing good teens.
Yeah,
but this,

1750
01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.230
this is not what we're talking about though.
We're talking about,

1751
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:17.780
it's called the Zeke.
You'll mounted to Zq.

1752
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:23.210
Jamie's just make up some Russians over here.
Stephanie,
pretty common.

1753
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:27.630
E,
z.
E,
z.
E,
Z,

1754
01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:32.060
e k e l isn't a zeal to the dude from the Bible.
It is the guy from the Bible.

1755
01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:36.110
The saw the UFO.
Oh yeah.
That was the first ever one in the UFC and the UFC.
Yes,

1756
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:41.000
but but a Zeke,
you'll chokes in MMA.
Just Google.
Ezekiel,
chokes and MMA.

1757
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.450
What's the guy's name?
Maybe that's the only one that's up.

1758
01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:46.490
The top five videos are just him doing it.
Oh,

1759
01:44:46.491 --> 01:44:50.030
he's done it more than how many times he's done it taught him.
Oh,
the same fight.

1760
01:44:50.110 --> 01:44:53.810
Oh,
the one fight put play it just so we watched it again.
It's pretty crazy.

1761
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:58.970
It's crazy that someone can figure out a way to do something that no one has

1762
01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:03.971
ever done before in 2018 so he's gets the headlines and then he's just holding

1763
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:09.551
on and then he slides it in deeper and then this dude's fucked tap and that is

1764
01:45:10.731 --> 01:45:15.320
so crazy.
Yeah,
that is so crazy.
He just clinches on your head.

1765
01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:19.160
Then I do look so disappointed.
He was like,

1766
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:21.990
how the fuck did I get that?
He just clinches on that bag.

1767
01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.750
And then just the slips it in Saudi had this one in the bag [inaudible] full

1768
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.690
mountain.
It's already got this mother fucker and format.
Yeah,
he's gonna be,

1769
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:34.400
he's thinking about the after party and everything.
Yeah,
Alexi Oli.

1770
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:36.680
Nick.
That's a bad motherfucker.

1771
01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:39.620
It's interesting how many people that we're seeing right now from Russia,

1772
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:44.240
you know,
from the former Soviet Union,
eastern bloc countries.

1773
01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:48.920
It's really amazing.
I mean,
it's a beat.
Norma Madoff.

1774
01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.340
Um,
you know,
you can keep going down the line.

1775
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:55.430
There's so many of these guys that are coming up.
It's really a what?

1776
01:45:55.431 --> 01:45:56.420
A hotbed of talent,

1777
01:45:56.421 --> 01:46:00.590
especially Dagestan and how many bad motherfuckers come out of Dagestan.
Yeah.

1778
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:06.200
It's a beef versus,
I mean,
I'm hubby versus Connor.
Like Holy Shit.

1779
01:46:06.201 --> 01:46:10.610
Is that fight interesting.
What the fuck is going to happen?
It really happens.

1780
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:15.130
You don't,
is going to happen.
Don't say that son of a bitch.
I'll get them there.

1781
01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:20.480
I mean,
how weird is it looking at Conor with no belt cubby with the belt?

1782
01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.720
I mean forever could be just trying to get a shot at that belt.

1783
01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:25.570
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:26.510
<v 1>And the way he wanted.</v>

1785
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:28.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1786
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:33.140
<v 1>Crazy shit.
Setting up this fight.
This fight is a fucking interesting fight,
man,</v>

1787
01:46:33.141 --> 01:46:38.060
because if Connor can't stop that down,
does he go the way of everybody else?

1788
01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:41.690
Does he get mauled the way everybody else got mall?

1789
01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.340
Does he get mauled the way?

1790
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:48.060
Michael Johnson got mauled z get mauled the way Dasan hills.
You still sign?

1791
01:46:48.061 --> 01:46:53.040
Yours got mauled.
Uh,
Chandler.
Oh,
not Chandler.
A Johnson.

1792
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:55.040
Michael Johnson.
Yeah,
we said Johnson.

1793
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.170
Edson Barboza and then he got mauled.

1794
01:46:58.230 --> 01:47:02.280
The Way Barboza got mauled was scary because like halfway into the first round

1795
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:08.100
could Biebs taking them down and you see Barboza just taking a deep breath like

1796
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:11.520
this.
I like realizing like,
oh no.
Yeah,

1797
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.600
like what in the fuck is all this about?
It's worse than I imagined.
Yeah.

1798
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:17.940
This is just a completely different,
they really,
I mean,

1799
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.740
no doubt Connor probably has the heaviest hands in the game.

1800
01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:27.510
Pound for pound,
no doubt,
but take down defense and fighting off your back.

1801
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:30.960
That has nothing to do with the power.
It's not,
it doesn't translate.

1802
01:47:30.961 --> 01:47:33.180
And also what is it going to look like?

1803
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:38.210
Is his take down defense better than Michael Johnson's?

1804
01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:44.180
Is his take down defense better than Edson Barboza or quinto who's a wrestler.

1805
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:48.720
Yeah.
I mean our stuffed his takedowns a couple times in the first round.
Yeah.

1806
01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:53.180
But you know,
the persistence is a really good wrestler.
Yeah.

1807
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.990
And how,
how good is Connors?
It's good question man.
He would,

1808
01:47:57.991 --> 01:48:00.120
if he gets what?
He gets tired,

1809
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:04.440
what if he gets taken down easier than all those other guys?
You don't know.

1810
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.190
Right.
You know what I mean?
He's got Dylan Dannis in his corner.
Dylan is a,

1811
01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:11.370
I think he wrestled in high school and um,

1812
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:16.830
I'm not too sure.
I brought in some Olympic caliber wrestler for his camp.

1813
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:22.620
Who did?
Connor brought in some,
uh,
some super high level wrestler.
First camp.

1814
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:27.750
Uh,
famous one.
Yeah.
James can find it.
A UFC fighter.

1815
01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:31.290
I don't believe he's a UFC fighter.
Say it again.

1816
01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:34.690
It does it say that.
Does he offered to help him?

1817
01:48:34.691 --> 01:48:35.740
I don't know if that's what you're really brought it.

1818
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:37.320
I don't know who we brought in.
Um,

1819
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:41.220
but I know that there was some talk about him bringing in some super high level

1820
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:44.370
wrestler.
Jordan Burroughs is not working with Connor,
which is,

1821
01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.260
that might be who you're talking about.
Could be,

1822
01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.380
well that would be one who you would want to work with you.

1823
01:48:49.381 --> 01:48:50.720
That would be someone who you would get asked.

1824
01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:52.410
But Jordan Burroughs is probably fucking busy.

1825
01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:56.460
And has he expressed an interest in fighting and MMA?
Because if he does,

1826
01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:59.940
there's a lot of people that are fucked.
He tweeted out on the 13th of August,

1827
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:00.960
I'm not working with Connor.

1828
01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:03.660
I'm attempting to win a world championship of my own in October.

1829
01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:07.590
It doesn't say wrestling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
so he,
yeah,

1830
01:49:07.591 --> 01:49:08.191
that's what I was thinking.

1831
01:49:08.191 --> 01:49:10.560
Like he probably doesn't have time to help someone with a camp like that.

1832
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.660
Especially if they could.
This point is,

1833
01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:17.490
you know he's taken off right now if he ever decides to go into MMA like yeah,

1834
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.820
yeah,
I wonder what's going to happen in that fight him man,

1835
01:49:22.821 --> 01:49:25.410
I just don't know whether or not Khabib is going to be able to close the

1836
01:49:25.411 --> 01:49:26.670
distance without getting hit with a,

1837
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:28.930
Connor's going to be able to stay on the outside long enough where it could,

1838
01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:31.620
Khabib is going to come at him like with reckless abandon the way he did with

1839
01:49:31.621 --> 01:49:35.490
Edson Barboza and he just stormed after Barboza just walked him down.
Yeah.

1840
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.760
Well is he gonna be able to do that with Connor or is he going to clip coming
in?

1841
01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.640
I mean,
is he going to be able to fade?

1842
01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:46.620
That left hand is going to be able to stop that and if Konica just keep him from

1843
01:49:46.621 --> 01:49:50.260
taking them a couple of times in the first round,
just a couple of times.

1844
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:52.150
Just enough to put a little bit of doubt,

1845
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:55.750
get a little bit of that shit talk and going and land a couple of good punches.

1846
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.690
Or does Khabib just grab them early?

1847
01:49:58.691 --> 01:50:01.210
Ragdoll Boehm side control,

1848
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.010
elbows punched neon belly punch,
punch,
punch,
elbow punch.

1849
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:09.940
Do we just see a mauling?
It's interesting.

1850
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:14.760
You know it's,
it could go either way.
Like I see both I this,

1851
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.680
this one of those weird fights where I don't know what the fuck's going to

1852
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:17.891
happen,

1853
01:50:17.891 --> 01:50:21.100
but I don't think we're going to see like some crazy drawn out five round fight.

1854
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:22.060
I definitely could be wrong,

1855
01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.510
but I think we're going see like one person dominate,

1856
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.840
whether it's whoever figures out how to impose their game,

1857
01:50:28.841 --> 01:50:30.610
whether it's Conor can dominate on the feed.

1858
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:32.380
Our Khabib can dominate on the ground.

1859
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:35.800
You think that'll be the biggest paper view ever?
It's going to be huge.

1860
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:39.340
It's going to be so big that's going to be so good and not be the biggest one

1861
01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:42.160
will be giant it hunters the biggest star.
Right?

1862
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:45.160
The only thing it's going to hold it back as mainstream knowledge of it because

1863
01:50:45.161 --> 01:50:48.280
there's not a lot of press because Connor's not doing a lot of stuff.

1864
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:49.870
It's not like in the news a lot.
Like,

1865
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:52.270
how many of these regular people know that Connor is going to fight?

1866
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:57.430
You never see it on Instagram,
Macy and her files you have see pages.

1867
01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:02.620
If you and I see it,
you and I see a we fall MMA pages.
But fuck man.

1868
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:06.600
Is Khabib doing interviews?
Does he taught them?
I have no idea.
I don't.
No.

1869
01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:10.930
That means no man.
If you don't know.
Yeah,
I don't know what meeting shit.

1870
01:51:11.150 --> 01:51:14.800
I haven't seen much.
I mean I've seen some video footage of him training at Aka.

1871
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:19.390
The whole thing's crazy man.
So,
so I mean I'm,
I'm just,

1872
01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:22.150
I'm crossing toes and causing everything.

1873
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:25.720
Just please let this one go down please.

1874
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:28.090
I can't imagine someone getting injured.
I'd be so,

1875
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:30.310
I wouldn't mind if someone got injured.
I'd be so sad.

1876
01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:31.330
Well you wouldn't because Tony,

1877
01:51:31.331 --> 01:51:34.580
but jumping in with a tray and it's still going to be a great fight.
So the way,

1878
01:51:34.581 --> 01:51:38.380
fine.
Either way,
the guaranteed there's going to be some serious shit.

1879
01:51:38.410 --> 01:51:42.520
Either Tony Versus Khabib.
Tony versus Connor or controversy could be.

1880
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:46.690
I think Tony is one of the more dangerous fights for Connor because first of all

1881
01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:51.080
is durability,
is endurance is crazy.
He's ability to fight from anywhere.

1882
01:51:51.130 --> 01:51:54.250
Can he fights real good?
Standing up,
he puts a pace on you,

1883
01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:57.640
doesn't mind getting hit,
always walking,
walk forward.
Always walking forward,

1884
01:51:57.641 --> 01:52:01.030
walking people down.
If you hit him,
you can hit him and hurt him.
Doesn't matter.

1885
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:01.660
He survived.

1886
01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:06.660
He's rives finds a way to survive and one little scramble clench on the ground

1887
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:08.770
and there's a Darce right there.

1888
01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:12.370
I don't know if the landowner Vanatta [inaudible] is totally fair because I,

1889
01:52:12.371 --> 01:52:15.250
you know,
I mean people look at that and they'll go,
well it is fair.
But I mean,

1890
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.540
I think that was a last minute fight.
Am I right?

1891
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:20.320
He didn't really have a training camp for that one.

1892
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:25.350
I don't know if it was because it was a last minute fight or he does believe it

1893
01:52:26.051 --> 01:52:30.190
was last minute.
Um,
he was,
I'm not too sure.

1894
01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:33.550
All I know,
I don't know what happened in the net training camp,

1895
01:52:33.551 --> 01:52:37.810
but it wasn't a legit training camp for Tony,
but almost not making excuses.

1896
01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:41.560
But that's,
that's what happened also.
What else?
One of the reasons why,

1897
01:52:41.561 --> 01:52:42.970
I don't know if you could look at that,

1898
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.980
if it was like people were looking at the right way,

1899
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:49.600
because I think Lando is way more talented than people give them credit for

1900
01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:53.900
because I can't,
I think so too.
Yeah.
I think in,
in moments,
in his fights,

1901
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:55.760
he's just brilliant.
Yeah.

1902
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:59.720
And I think then he gets tired sometimes and he has moments where he fades off

1903
01:52:59.721 --> 01:53:02.750
and then moments where he's in these crazy wild slug fests,

1904
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:07.100
like the Bobby Green fights,
a great example of that,
that,
that in the,

1905
01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.940
you've watched the first round,
the first round,
he looks smooth as silk man.

1906
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:15.350
I mean,
he just looks fantastic.
It looks like a world beater,
but he tapers off.

1907
01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:18.890
He fades a little bit.
And uh,
I don't know what that is.
You know,
I'm not,

1908
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:22.670
I'm not sure what's causing them to fade,
but I think that at his best,

1909
01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:25.880
when he hits those real high notes like he did in the Tony Fight,

1910
01:53:25.881 --> 01:53:29.960
he's fucking dangerous,
man.
Anybody sleeps on,
Lando is in real trouble.

1911
01:53:29.961 --> 01:53:34.880
He's super athletic.
He does wild shit.
He's real creative and knocked out.

1912
01:53:34.881 --> 01:53:38.930
John McKenzie with a fucking wheel kick.
I mean,
whoa.
He do.

1913
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:41.690
He does wild shit man.
And he moves good dude.

1914
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:46.250
He's got an interesting kind of way of moving and he's not afraid to scrap heal

1915
01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.970
and that,
that not being afraid to scrap makes him dangerous but also makes him

1916
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:52.550
vulnerable,
which I think is cost him a little bit.

1917
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:56.690
But I think a big one is the endurance.
You know this some,

1918
01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:01.640
there's some people out there like I'm the guy that's working with Tj Dillashaw.

1919
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:05.220
Um,
what is his name?
The guy down in uh,

1920
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.380
southern California down near San Diego.
Um,

1921
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:13.640
Colivida.
Is that his name?
What does he teach?

1922
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:17.330
It's strength and conditioning coaches.
What's his name?
I don't know.

1923
01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:18.164
I'll text TJ.

1924
01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:23.000
See I just googled Tj Dillashaw new strength and conditioning program.

1925
01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:27.920
These guys like the nick curse on and the Sam [inaudible],
Sam,

1926
01:54:27.930 --> 01:54:30.080
Kavita,
that guy was,
he,

1927
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:34.040
if you watched the preparation videos for TJ getting ready for coding Dillashaw

1928
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:36.170
you see him doing all his wild shit,
man.

1929
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:41.120
Everyone's doing all these explosive crazy movements.
Just like back when,

1930
01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:46.010
um,
uh,
we saw TJ when w we saw,
um,

1931
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:50.930
when Bj was at his best when I'm Marinovich was training him.
And you know,

1932
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:52.370
curse on comes from,
that's cool too.

1933
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.000
You know that learning under the Marinovich has but that kind of crazy

1934
01:54:56.001 --> 01:55:01.001
plyometric cha training all its explosive shit that they're doing box jumps and

1935
01:55:01.071 --> 01:55:04.790
crazy things with medicine balls and slamming things and chat back and forth and

1936
01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:07.730
back and forth.
These guys getting phenomenal shape man.

1937
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:11.990
And I think that's imperative today.
I think today it's almost like,

1938
01:55:11.991 --> 01:55:14.000
it's not when,
when guys are getting ready for a fight,

1939
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:17.180
and this is one of the thing that nick curse on it said it's you already know

1940
01:55:17.181 --> 01:55:20.900
how to fight.
Like literally everything should be focused on your gas tank.

1941
01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:23.860
Like you only have six weeks have you don't know how to fight and you're not

1942
01:55:23.861 --> 01:55:26.120
gonna learn in six weeks,
you know how to fight.

1943
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:29.480
Six weeks should be just crazy gas tank work.

1944
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:34.550
And when he gets guys like,
like dos Anjos when he fought cowboy,

1945
01:55:34.551 --> 01:55:38.570
when he gets ahold of guys and,
and you see that style,

1946
01:55:38.571 --> 01:55:42.530
like when dos Anjos fought pedis when he's got that incredible kind of cardio

1947
01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:45.480
that's so hard to fuck with man.
Yeah.
You know,
the pommel horse,

1948
01:55:45.610 --> 01:55:49.740
is that how you say it?
The pommel horse pommel one of those things.

1949
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:53.670
Well in order to,
um,
to do that,

1950
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.860
you have to do this exercise where you put your feet,
there's like a,

1951
01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.810
like a chain hanging and it's got like a weightlifting belt and you put your

1952
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:04.440
feet in your ankles and you start doing it on that and it just spins like,

1953
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.880
oh wow.
And Tony's obsessed with it.
Nobody can do it.

1954
01:56:08.881 --> 01:56:11.580
Like Jeremiah,
Jeremy Chai,

1955
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.080
I bring in a bunch of 10 plan of black belts in and no one can even kind of do

1956
01:56:16.081 --> 01:56:20.970
it,
do it.
Seems like Gian Real.
But he,
he hasn't come to Tony's camp.
He's,

1957
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.570
he's two hours away.
It's,
it's too hard for them.
But um,
and those guys,

1958
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:28.550
cause they're breakdancing background.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's,
that's what he's,

1959
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:31.790
he's really getting into gymnastics right now.
Tony.
He's,

1960
01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:33.960
he's trying to take his fighting.

1961
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:37.170
Well that was giant for George Saint Pierre with GSP started getting in

1962
01:56:37.171 --> 01:56:38.970
gymnastics,
you know,
and uh,

1963
01:56:38.971 --> 01:56:42.870
watching my daughter do it and watching like the amount of physical strength it

1964
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:46.920
takes to do like handsprings backflips and all that stuff.
All that.

1965
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:48.590
It's all explosion.
Yeah.

1966
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:52.040
Being able to control yourself on the bars and the rings and the,

1967
01:56:52.041 --> 01:56:54.950
the amount of physical strength that you have to have to be able to do that,

1968
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:57.660
that,
that applies directly to Jujitsu.

1969
01:56:57.661 --> 01:57:00.870
I'm thinking about putting some gymnastics equipment up.
I got rings already.

1970
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:02.730
Oh really?
A rings in the bounce shit.

1971
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.470
You think you're going to try to bring iron man or what's it called?
Iron Cross.

1972
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.580
I don't know if I could do that.
I'm too fat.
I call it out like that.

1973
01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:17.100
I Dunno man.
But it's great.
It's great to like,
um,

1974
01:57:17.370 --> 01:57:19.800
for rotation,
like as you're doing a chin up,

1975
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.220
you know about grabbing it like this.
And then as you're,

1976
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:25.290
as you're two and a chin up,
rotating in.

1977
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:29.760
So I rotate my arms with the rings as I'm doing Chin ups.
I liked that a lot.

1978
01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:33.270
I feel like it gives me more of a range of motion and just a bar.

1979
01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.040
I like doing chin ups on the bar too.

1980
01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:37.710
But I think that especially like as I get older,

1981
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:41.700
like range of motion is very important to not lose that.
I see a lot of people,

1982
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:44.580
they lose their range of motion cause they're not working on the stretching,

1983
01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:49.680
the not working on do they do a lot of meatheads shit and they don't work on

1984
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:52.890
keeping their mobility at a high level.
You know?

1985
01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:57.090
That's why another thing that I like is stretching out in the sauna.

1986
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.560
You have a stretch out in the sauna.
Man,

1987
01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:02.660
haven't done a signup thing and in a while and you telling me once I'm come by

1988
01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:06.780
we'll have some fun conversations in the sauna but getting in the sauna man and

1989
01:58:06.781 --> 01:58:07.080
just,

1990
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.620
you get super heated up and then just start stretching out like everything's

1991
01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:15.180
loose and warmed up and you can just pull things into better positions and just

1992
01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:18.990
give everything like a stretch.
Just to keep doing hot yoga all the time.

1993
01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.440
I love it.
I gotta get back into it now.
Now,
now that my shoulders,

1994
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:25.080
I think my shoulder could hang with yoga right now.

1995
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.870
I think I just don't have any pressure on it.
You want to go with me?

1996
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:32.660
Come with me and my class.
Let's do it.
What days do you go?
Didn't too early.

1997
01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:36.150
It depends.
Yeah,
I do.
I like early,
early.
I don't want to say,

1998
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:40.210
I'll tell you I've got 600 people show up.
5:00 AM Oh no,
no.

1999
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:42.040
Go into the dark dude.
That's what's up.

2000
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:45.850
<v 3>We'll do that coon Delaney.
Fuck that.

2001
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:49.310
Used to go that Cuny,

2002
01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:53.610

2003
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:58.540
Crazy head Bang John Shit.
Headbanging I've heard about it.

2004
01:58:59.930 --> 01:59:03.010
Yeah.
Next serious headbanging like Metallica style.

2005
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.700
Headbanging just too many people that say that you could trip balls for it to

2006
01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:10.550
not be trying to shake out the DMT demons.
Can I get dean was

2007
01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.250

what'd you get out of here?
Anything else?
Anything else going on?
Uh,

2008
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:21.190
Ebi 17 coming up September 29.

2009
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:25.180

2012

2013
01:59:35.891 --> 01:59:37.480
Twitter said it in a series of tweets.

2014
01:59:37.481 --> 01:59:39.970
The band comes weeks after Jones was banished.
Suspended.

2015
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:46.720
Well Anyway,

2026
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:29.260
the best gap between grappling and MMA training as far as I'm concerned.

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.670
Thank you man.

2035
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.670
Eddie Bravo 10 P on Instagram.
On Instagram.
Thank you.

2036
02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:04.330
And Toronto.
We're moving that of venue.
It was supposed to be the Ricoh Coliseum.

2037
02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:07.570
Now it's going to be the Scotia Bank arena.
It was both the union.

2038
02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.940
It's because of a union dispute.
We talked about this before.

2039
02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:12.190
I'm not crossing into union picket lines.

2040
02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:15.880
So we moved to a new venue in the new venue is also,
yeah,
it's bigger,

2041
02:01:15.881 --> 02:01:18.100
but it's also a union venue.
Uh,

2042
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:21.400
it's just that they don't have a problem with their contract or it's not,

2043
02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.820
you know,
not the same dispute.
So I think it's the same union in fact.

2044
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:30.010
But when we go,
when everybody from the old tickets gets their new tickets,

2045
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:30.970
then we'll sell.

2046
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.070
There's 1200 more tickets for this new place cause that'd be within the next

2047
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:39.740
couple of days.
I'm hoping.
All right,
Joe rogan.com for all that shit.
Bye.

2048
02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:40.480
<v 6>Thank you.</v>
