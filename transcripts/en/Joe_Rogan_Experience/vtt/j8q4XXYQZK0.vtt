<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I wake up like an hour later and my ears</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ringing in the rooms going like</v>

<v Speaker 1>he ate all the fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they ate this much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they like a,</v>

24
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny amount,</v>

25
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>they will fucked up all night and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a guy who I only get high at that</v>

26
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>point a couple of times in my life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that now my roommate's talking to me.</v>

27
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right where you at?</v>

28
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>He's like five feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like he's yelling from a</v>

29
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tripping on the fucking they were</v>

30
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know if they should take me</v>

31
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fucking puking.</v>

32
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm swearing at him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a week later,</v>

34
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching the superbowl and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still being fucked up</v>

35
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just said when you went,</v>

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>when you ingested orally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way stronger and,</v>

37
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

38
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it little reason my system.</v>

39
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look it up,</v>

41
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is from somebody who didn't.</v>

42
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't smoke a lot of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

43
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Week later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

44
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>at least a weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>at least I'm probably being conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because it stays in.</v>

46
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>If you saw how much I ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:54.741
<v Speaker 1>if you saw how much tomato sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a grease ball and,</v>

48
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they will like,</v>

49
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>they will fucked up all night with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>much and they were like,</v>

50
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making of the fingers like a</v>

51
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>hockey puck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget I'm not on TV.</v>

52
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about half the size of a hockey.</v>

53
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>But I was sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>and my ears were ringing and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

55
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>my roommate's like that close to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like he was yelling down the</v>

56
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>hallway.</v>

57
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because as we talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and we've talked a lot about</v>

58
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>the damage guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've gone through all the</v>

59
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>various techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.800
<v Speaker 1>after you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>a discussion with Brendan Schaub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people came out and they</v>

62
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:27.151
<v Speaker 1>started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

63
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>should we feel bad for talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sport?</v>

64
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard that conversation again,</v>

65
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point should we feel guilty for</v>

66
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>watching guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know our aging fighters and you know,</v>

67
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you could do the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>

68
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly do the same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military where there there's a lot</v>

69
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>of traumatic brain injuries taking place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military as well.</v>

70
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I think people forget in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think people need to understand.</v>

71
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not to excuse anything or take away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the conversation.</v>

72
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of a mitigation.</v>

73
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men and women who do sports like</v>

74
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take it away from them,</v>

75
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>they're going to find it elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a need.</v>

77
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a guy like me had I not found mixed</v>

78
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to find something.</v>

79
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.101
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

80
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>there's drive inside us to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme that makes people raise their</v>

81
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure you want it?</v>

82
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.420
<v Speaker 1>You really are going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have that,</v>

83
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just a personality trait.</v>

84
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

85
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>if mixed martial arts didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at cowboy cerrone,</v>

86
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the things he does to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill that hole in his life and you're</v>

87
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>going to get a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why guys don't want to retire.</v>

88
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know the risks.</v>

89
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>We all know everything we're up against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still sign the contract,</v>

90
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and so it's important to remind them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you know for people that are</v>

91
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>anti this and anti that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

93
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>we're going to find something else to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at some point we've got to be</v>

94
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>accountable for our own actions.</v>

95
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a wide variety of human beings.</v>

96
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be sedentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that sit in their couch is going</v>

97
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>to be people who want to fucking rock</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb with no ropes.</v>

98
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>My friend already went back to the flip</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

99
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>flip phone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He does all of his social media stuff</v>

103
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>either on a computer or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't check his twitter on his</v>

104
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.054
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His.</v>

105
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting too wrapped up in like I</v>

106
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.240
<v Speaker 2>would be talking to someone that goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

107
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.243
<v Speaker 2>I want to finish</v>

108
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.850
<v Speaker 3>sleep last night on like literally the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my iphone hit my forehead three times</v>

109
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 3>and I finally gave up because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

110
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:26.840
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I going to post?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

111
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100
<v Speaker 3>another concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

112
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at.</v>

113
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's spelled correctly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably like a bunch of weird</v>

114
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 3>wingding character or something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>brings me back.</v>

115
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.090
<v Speaker 2>So what I was going to say is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

116
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about iphones that</v>

117
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 2>drag people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>There's something about like being able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at videos and you're,</v>

119
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you're interacting with your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 2>The interaction that you get with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cars,</v>

121
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:52.280
<v Speaker 2>the field that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the addiction that you get to get in</v>

122
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:54.950
<v Speaker 2>those things is very different than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new cars.</v>

123
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to ask you this because</v>

124
00:04:57.321 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>you're the expert on those older cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is there like a point where it</v>

125
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.370
<v Speaker 2>crosses this line and it's not the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience anymore?</v>

126
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And was there like a sweet spot in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>production of cars?</v>

127
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we're there a spot where all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological advances and all the</v>

128
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 2>advances of suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they may allow you to get</v>

129
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 2>around a race track a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker,</v>

130
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 2>especially with like PDK transmissions</v>
<v Speaker 2>with dual clutch is working at the same</v>

131
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do allow you to get places faster,</v>

132
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 2>but is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it missing all the stuff that gets</v>

133
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:32.120
<v Speaker 2>people excited about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because I know that driving an</v>

134
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:35.720
<v Speaker 2>automatic car is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is satisfying,</v>

135
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:40.721
<v Speaker 2>but I also know it's not as satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 2>as shifting your own gears as the field</v>

136
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to get from a car like</v>
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>

137
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

138
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>I think ultimately moving forward the</v>
<v Speaker 3>manual may become a lost art because you</v>

139
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.810
<v Speaker 3>love kids growing up today that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to drive manual cars.</v>

140
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 3>So the point of reference is completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 3>most of us here I think learn driving a</v>
<v Speaker 3>manual car and everything that you said</v>

142
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 3>is perfectly true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That a see interaction between man and</v>

143
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gets you down the road differently</v>

144
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 3>in a manual than what it does in a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
