<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

14
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.490

15
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where we were tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden Georgia tweeted me </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and I tweet him and I say,</v>

17
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>you want to do my podcast and says fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ya.</v>

18
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we meet in Vegas and we're </v>

19
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>hanging out in vegas like we'd known </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other forever.</v>

20
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you dude.</v>

21
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of fucking fun man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia was a cool cat.</v>

22
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite shows of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that ancient aliens.</v>

24
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>I've got a big stack of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't necessarily agree with </v>

25
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you do either.</v>

26
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

27
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

28
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I got from you </v>

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>talking to you in Vegas.</v>

30
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

31
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's going to Atlanta,</v>

32
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>this was a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't know what I mean,</v>

33
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:31.771
<v Speaker 1>but you were like really open to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility which I truly admire in a </v>

34
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

35
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So many people are married to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ideas,</v>

36
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>even preposterous ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

37
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really fucking believes that there's </v>

39
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>reptilians that are running this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says he's got facts and </v>

41
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

42
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen a reptilian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>

43
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>how can you be sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you be when you hear stuff like </v>

44
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in the business of,</v>

45
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>of this wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

46
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:01.951
<v Speaker 1>You have a world where so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>look down on anything that's even </v>

47
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>remotely outside of the mainstream of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets ridiculed,</v>

48
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but when you see a guy like David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>do you ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this motherfucker works for </v>

50
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>the government puts says so much and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much shit.</v>

51
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he starts talking about </v>

52
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>reptilians and he got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's classic disinformation.</v>

53
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>That's like the move that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>if you want to a piss in the well we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do is just throw a bunch of shit </v>

55
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.631
<v Speaker 1>in there that really makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the CIA killed JFK and we were in </v>

56
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam for money and the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex.</v>

57
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It really does run things just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower said.</v>

58
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's a pace on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been donating their telepathically</v>

59
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>for years and what we do is we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a place where we go,</v>

60
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we teleport people and you have to be </v>

61
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 1>naked and that's why women aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be on the base.</v>

62
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about,</v>

63
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Bright,</v>

64
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>thrilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that wacky shit in there.</v>

65
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of piss on all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is interesting because you know,</v>

66
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.461
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy said that the CIA killed </v>

68
00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:08.791
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he also talked about the Wacky </v>

69
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:08.791
<v Speaker 1>Shit on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:08.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

71
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:09.860
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>to me it's very resistant when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your gut feeling because our people</v>

73
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>out there really at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of this book that you would say </v>

74
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>also carry some math so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

75
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Know at the end of the day you just have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to let it go and be like,</v>

76
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what those people are not gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>know anything.</v>

77
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have a choice because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end we all make a choice what we </v>

78
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we subscribe to and you know,</v>

79
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>some of that stuff is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what I mean?</v>

80
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the science today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science book,</v>

81
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>you know there are all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and ideas and it's pretty much </v>

82
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.170
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge on the cutting edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

83
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you look in a textbook from 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

84
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>which was published by the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was considered cutting edge of </v>

85
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>knowledge at the time.</v>

86
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you're looking at that textbook </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

87
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 1>200 years later and 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging obsolete.</v>

88
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what has been disproven?</v>

89
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:28.441
<v Speaker 1>Like what field has been completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>reworked over the last 200 years to </v>

90
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>their stuff as stuff gets updated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is absolutely.</v>

91
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It all comes down to an edison were </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain procedures that time considered </v>

92
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:45.571
<v Speaker 1>to be perfect like radiation treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were actually run from the station </v>

93
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>on the monitor comes down said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

94
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can totally make.</v>

95
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>He was a shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on youtube,</v>

96
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>on a Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're friends and they're </v>

97
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.171
<v Speaker 1>going to be gone each other to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Alex at one weekend in Vegas </v>

101
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you get a better sense of what else </v>
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>

102
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.180

<v Speaker 1>24 slash seven,</v>

103
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a fucking conspiracy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep him from getting a cigarette.</v>

104
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>She tried to keep it from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beer was this woman who works at the </v>

105
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees me,</v>

106
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>he avoids me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoids contact management.</v>

107
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Keep me from having a parent who's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tickets.</v>

108
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Remember the tick everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

109
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I was worried that we weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get in the UFC tickets.</v>

110

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>he's right about a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

118
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the percentage is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always throw out a number like he's </v>

119
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.380
<v Speaker 1>right about 70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 30 percent flexing that he just,</v>

120
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of fills in the blanks.</v>

121
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of filling in the blanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 70 percent that he's,</v>

122
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>or whatever number it is that he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

123
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking.</v>

124
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And he's a perfect example of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about before,</v>

125
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>like where you have to Kinda like use </v>
<v Speaker 1>her own filter.</v>

126
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff that he says that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an incredible amount of merit.</v>

127
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.010
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this stuff that says you're just </v>

128
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

129
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>He gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't go reptilian crazy,</v>

130
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but he gets deep in new world order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets a like,</v>

131
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>like eugenics crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets like he's sure they have a </v>

132
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>population decreased plan where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill off.</v>

133
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Most people except for 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>elites were going to be able to live </v>

134
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

135
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have some fucking rock solid </v>

136
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>evidence to throw that one around.</v>

137
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't just toss that out like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach ball that the elites are gonna.</v>

138
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Kill out fucking have a population </v>
<v Speaker 1>except $500,000.</v>

139
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe be someone's thought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's outside of the realm</v>

140
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.811
<v Speaker 1>of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your business though is filled with </v>

141
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mean,</v>

142
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.941
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are hundreds of billions of stars </v>

143
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:15.881
<v Speaker 1>in this galaxy and we have already </v>
<v Speaker 1>spotted so many of them over the last </v>

144
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>couple of decades or a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

145
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>that are in the goldilocks zone where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know kid possibly inhabit life.</v>

146
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>They sprouted visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the number are,</v>

147
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:28.751
<v Speaker 1>orbiting increases all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly finding planets that </v>

148
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:28.751
<v Speaker 1>could possibly support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

149
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And planets that are older than ours by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a billion years plus or.</v>

150
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>

151
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>The fascinating thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>when the sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Erich von Daniken first wrote,</v>

153
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>chariots of the Gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>the general consensus in the sixties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies was that this discussion was </v>

155
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>even more taboo than it is today </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

156
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>But back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe we were alone in the universe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was only a handful like Frank </v>

159
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Drake and the Carl Sagan who proposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea or dabbled with the idea that,</v>

160
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:06.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might not be the only ones in the </v>

161
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:06.641
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate.</v>

162
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a community now today.</v>

163
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be hard pressed to find any </v>

164
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.451
<v Speaker 1>scientist or any astronomer or </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist that will tell you that </v>

165
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:20.861
<v Speaker 1>they think we're alone in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've definitely switched where it's </v>

166
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 1>almost a given now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>they're intelligent life exists in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

169
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.530
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big taboo topic that we have today </v>

170
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.371
<v Speaker 1>that still remains is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say there is life in the </v>

171
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the galaxy,</v>

172
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but there is no way that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent life could have ever been </v>

173
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>here or visited birth in the remote past</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even present day.</v>

174
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is a fallacy in logic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because granted the distances between </v>

175
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the stars are indeed huge too mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>boggling.</v>

176
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.400
<v Speaker 3>But just because we can't get from point</v>
<v Speaker 3>a to point b doesn't mean another </v>

177
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.831
<v Speaker 3>society that like you mentioned where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit or inferred that there are </v>

178
00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 3>bullying years older than us on third </v>
<v Speaker 3>world at least as a billion years old.</v>

179
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are a very,</v>

180
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>very young culture by any means of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

181
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 3>So someone that's only 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years older,</v>

182
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have technologies or other </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of.</v>

183
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Something where they combine biology </v>
<v Speaker 3>with technology and things like that </v>

184
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 3>that we couldn't even dream up right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

185
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Our imagination is the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>limits us from seeing what they could </v>

186
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.241
<v Speaker 3>possibly have given them a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>years in advance of us in a million </v>

187
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 3>years or even a few hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

188
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.430
<v Speaker 3>look what Nikola Tesla was doing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early 20th century and,</v>

189
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at what's going on today.</v>

190
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:56.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a gigantic monumental leap and </v>

191
00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 3>just a little over 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

192
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

193
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:01.881
<v Speaker 3>just imagine showing your great grandpa </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of our phones today.</v>

194
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to,</v>

195
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 3>to him and star Trek couldn't fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

196
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

197
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.110
<v Speaker 3>They thought you were going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to beam people onto a planet,</v>

198
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.980
<v Speaker 3>but they still had walkie talkies </v>
<v Speaker 3>cookout.</v>

199
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking,</v>

200
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.970
<v Speaker 3>he didn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't wrap</v>

201
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.010
<v Speaker 1>their head around the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have real time communication on </v>

202
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>that states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I convene people there,</v>

203
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>but you can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you can just talk into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The voice thing.</v>

205
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Depressed the voice thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Eddie Bravo,</v>

206
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 1>bravo comes wikipedia page videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking amazing and it's even </v>

207
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.140
<v Speaker 1>with three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 years fast as fuck,</v>

208
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any alien species that's a thousand </v>

209
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.050
<v Speaker 1>years from last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to know what they can do is </v>

210
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 1>absolutely silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already understand principles of </v>

211
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.721
<v Speaker 1>folding space time and meeting those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>points and having a gateway to something</v>

212
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>they know that the possibility that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>existing in the unit,</v>

213
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>completely theoretical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many things were theoretical just</v>

214
00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:08.951
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hundred years ago and look </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing right now with with </v>

215
00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:11.720
<v Speaker 1>this higgs Boson collider in that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>move on plasma,</v>

216
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but part of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sugar camp is 40 or $440.</v>

217
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Billion tons I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

218
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Either one fucking great sugar cube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that they're gonna come up,</v>

220
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

221
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 3>they're hinting that they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to discovering the God particle.</v>

222
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.210
<v Speaker 3>This is Boston us today in 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 3>something a thousand years from now.</v>

223
00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:36.070
<v Speaker 3>My thought is always though that why </v>
<v Speaker 3>would we even see it?</v>

224
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.620
<v Speaker 3>They could come as clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think they're gonna be able to</v>

225
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:41.290
<v Speaker 3>disguise themselves as a fucking tree or</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not.</v>

226
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Not Be visible at a around us right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is the same allegory and </v>

227
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.860
<v Speaker 3>sometimes uses if you have some patio </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting out on your patio and you have </v>

228
00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 3>a cat and that cat loves to go outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the patio every night and you look up</v>

229
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 3>to the sky or look up to the patio </v>
<v Speaker 3>lights,</v>

230
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 3>sees the lights and the cat might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

231
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 3>this is very pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful,</v>

232
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 3>but that cat has no concept of what goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>into those patio lights,</v>

233
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 3>that there's electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic wiring,</v>

234
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>

235
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 3>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that,</v>

236
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 3>that is exactly the concept of exit </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrials as well,</v>

237
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.860
<v Speaker 3>that they can conceivably show up as </v>
<v Speaker 3>some type of shape shifters or something</v>

238
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.250
<v Speaker 3>and not just into people but into </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects or something because they would </v>

239
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 3>use exactly the same what we use today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's technology,</v>

240
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 3>but there's something involved where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.510
<v Speaker 3>just because we can't figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean it does not exist.</v>

242
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I always say I always bring up what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>call the art theory when it comes to,</v>

243
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to aliens.</v>

244
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And my theory is that the idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you couldn't smell,</v>

245
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.760
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have a sense of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have no idea that farts </v>

246
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 3>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had no idea that you were just </v>

247
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 3>sitting in someone's asked gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

248
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 3>You would have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no clue,</v>

249
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.420
<v Speaker 3>but because you have a sense of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this invisible thing all of a sudden </v>

250
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:06.420
<v Speaker 3>becomes a reality.</v>

251
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 3>How do we not know there are a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>different senses,</v>

252
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.490
<v Speaker 3>a million different things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us all the time that we just </v>

253
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.521
<v Speaker 3>can't tune into an all some alien has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do is tune into something that's outside</v>

254
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:22.681
<v Speaker 3>of our spectrum to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into something that's not within our </v>

255
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:26.041
<v Speaker 3>natural ability to perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean our natural ability perceive as </v>

256
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 3>very similar to the people that live </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

257
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 3>years ago and we're throwing fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed sticks it,</v>

258
00:13:30.411 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 3>moving animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very,</v>

259
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 3>very little difference between us </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically now and then.</v>

260
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.800
<v Speaker 3>So how do we not know that the systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have in place are all in place </v>

261
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 3>for the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in place for you.</v>

262
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.280
<v Speaker 3>You hear animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you,</v>

263
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 3>you see moving things you know and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>smelled food.</v>

264
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.070
<v Speaker 3>You know these are all in place to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>us alive and keep us successful.</v>

265
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.310
<v Speaker 3>We could very well be developing new </v>
<v Speaker 3>senses because of Wifi and because of </v>

266
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 3>all these cellular signals and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

267
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.530
<v Speaker 3>How sick are you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy?</v>

268
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 3>You want to go home or you that sick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to go home.</v>

269
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to get everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>

270
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking some shit flying through </v>

271
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 3>the air in this room right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's this guy's sick and he's got some</v>

272
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:19.591
<v Speaker 3>germs inside of his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some shit that you can't see </v>

273
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 3>unless you get a microscope and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>little invading animals.</v>

274
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to take over and kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

275
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 3>So his army right now is at war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much shit out there.</v>

276
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 3>There's so much shit out there that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't wrap our heads around because it's</v>

277
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 3>happening right here at this table right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

278
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 3>There's aliens watching us in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fridge.</v>

279
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 3>You get into your field and how did you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get on ancient aliens?</v>

280
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>

281
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:44.041
<v Speaker 3>I really have to thank my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandma because growing up I,</v>

282
00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:50.351
<v Speaker 3>I traveled around the world with my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my parents and they made sure that </v>

283
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:55.351
<v Speaker 3>we would go to those different museums </v>
<v Speaker 3>and archeological sites and things like </v>

284
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

285
00:14:56.001 --> 00:15:01.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like guided tours by the resident </v>

286
00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 3>archeologists or the resident curator </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

287
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then whenever I would come back </v>

288
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:07.180
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandma would say,</v>

289
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.651
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've just been taught about the </v>

290
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 3>contemporary contemporary ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular cultures,</v>

291
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.700
<v Speaker 3>but let me show you that other ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>theories exist as well.</v>

292
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>So she would tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lantus,</v>

293
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 3>she would tell me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:27.431
<v Speaker 3>the ancient astronauts theory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chariots of the gods and all those </v>

295
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 3>different viewpoints that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposed by others.</v>

296
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.060
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these types of topics have been.</v>

297
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I've been exposed to those fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a fairly young age.</v>

298
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was all dinner table </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

299
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

300
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my parents or my grandparents would</v>

301
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 3>visit a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

302
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 3>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she always used to say that whenever we </v>

303
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 3>would have to use this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would say,</v>

304
00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that all of this that we </v>

305
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 3>have today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been here before.</v>

306
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 3>And I never knew what she meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

307
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was five,</v>

308
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years old,</v>

309
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.110
<v Speaker 3>but today I knew exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I finally understand what she meant </v>

310
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.110
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.260
<v Speaker 3>this is just a repetition of history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How high was she when she started this?</v>

312
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

313
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.340
<v Speaker 3>I was too young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure they're talking about </v>

314
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

315
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Not My mom.</v>

316
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is,</v>

317
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.920
<v Speaker 3>she's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of them that right now.</v>

318
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.600
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

320
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.720
<v Speaker 3>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 3>so today especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 3>now that my parents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time,</v>

324
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 3>they with that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting your time with this,</v>

325
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Yada Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

326
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.130
<v Speaker 3>now all I have to say is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I am here because of my parents and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandparents.</v>

328
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

329
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>it was their fault that all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

330
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 3>What year did chariots of the gods came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

331
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 3>It came out like in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

332
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:55.721
<v Speaker 3>it was first published in German under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the title memories of the future in 1968</v>

333
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.590
<v Speaker 3>and then it was a runaway success and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first English edition came out in </v>

334
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 3>1970 and within a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

335
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 3>eight months or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>6 million copies have been sold.</v>

336
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:13.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was an absolute phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they called the keitus and he was a</v>

337
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:20.861
<v Speaker 3>huge success worldwide and here we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2011 in chariots of the Gods is still</v>

338
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:23.460
<v Speaker 3>read Eric Fund.</v>

339
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Danny can just turned 77 years old by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

340
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.020
<v Speaker 3>He says hello to the entire audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very happy and excited that I'm </v>

341
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 3>under program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he says yes,</v>

342
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>absolutely listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're trying.</v>

343
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to get him on the program </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring them in.</v>

344
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:41.110
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remote sensing.</v>

345
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Where does he live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lives in Switzerland.</v>

346
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking fly out to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

347
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.110
<v Speaker 3>well we'll definitely set something up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it when you first met him.</v>

348
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.740
<v Speaker 3>It's that kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

349
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>I would say it was weird the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually hung out and had a </v>

350
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.720
<v Speaker 3>conversation and stuff because I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

351
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I had gone to some of his lectures when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in my early teens.</v>

352
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

353
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 3>it's different than someone named </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

354
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

355
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

356
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I started the magazine that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>published.</v>

357
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.780
<v Speaker 3>You published legendary 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when we started in 1998 and in </v>

358
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 3>legendary times is basically all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient civilizations.</v>

359
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's specifically geared towards </v>

360
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.320
<v Speaker 3>ancient civilizations in respect to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient astronaut theory suggesting or </v>

361
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.870
<v Speaker 3>exploring the idea whether or not extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrials flesh and blood exits.</v>

362
00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Terrestrials visited earth in the remote</v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

363
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 3>And by that I don't mean you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years ago,</v>

364
00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

365
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>8,000</v>

366
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 3>years ago from today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at it,</v>

367
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:53.421
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the Sumerian texts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at funding Akins work and what </v>

368
00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 3>is your gut impression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you an thank you if got not making</v>

369
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 3>a conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which way do you lean?</v>

370
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean 50 percent that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were here 50 percent than maybe </v>

371
00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:03.321
<v Speaker 3>something else happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

372
00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 3>How do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than 50 percent personally?</v>

373
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

374
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you the most hope or the most a</v>

375
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.010
<v Speaker 3>reason to believe this.</v>

376
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's I,</v>

377
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 3>I sometimes liken it to when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>completing a puzzle,</v>

378
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.290
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter how big the puzzle is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the more pieces you put together,</v>

379
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:29.811
<v Speaker 3>the more pieces you fit into place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when that puzzle is not yet </v>

380
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:32.370
<v Speaker 3>completed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've all done puzzles as kids,</v>

381
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 3>it gets easier as you move along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can stop somewhere three </v>

382
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:43.881
<v Speaker 3>quarters of the way and you can look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that puzzle and you know exactly what </v>

383
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 3>the picture looks like even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not yet complete.</v>

384
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:52.341
<v Speaker 3>And there's a couple of pieces missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is what the ancient astronauts </v>

385
00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:56.841
<v Speaker 3>theory to me is like that there are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many indications from our ancient </v>

386
00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 3>cultures that the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion is inescapable.</v>

387
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not just saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

388
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.520
<v Speaker 3>because I'm pulling this out of my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because there are stories and there </v>

389
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 3>are physical pieces of evidence that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only conclusion that we can draw unless </v>

390
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
<v Speaker 3>we go into the realm of the fantastical </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the unlikely is that we have been </v>

391
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.180
<v Speaker 3>visited by flesh and blood exits the </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

392
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.540
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is like,</v>

393
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:28.910
<v Speaker 3>if you were going to try to convince </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

394
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.160
<v Speaker 3>what is the most compelling evidence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your opinion that,</v>

395
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said there's,</v>

396
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 3>there's evidence where you cannot draw </v>
<v Speaker 3>any other conclusions.</v>

397
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.400
<v Speaker 3>What is the most compelling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

398
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where I truly enjoy and </v>

399
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.161
<v Speaker 3>respect the work of many archaeologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world because they excavating</v>

400
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.380
<v Speaker 3>a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

401
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.690
<v Speaker 3>sites and different monuments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're truly breaking their backs for </v>

402
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>some fantastic research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

403
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when you look at that research</v>
<v Speaker 3>or some of the ideas that they present,</v>

404
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some faults in,</v>

405
00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in logic there because they,</v>

406
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:13.381
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that we have moved a block </v>

407
00:21:13.381 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 3>that's 1,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons heavy,</v>

408
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:20.701
<v Speaker 3>1,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>metric tons heavy with a piece of string</v>

409
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 3>and some chicken bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And today our cranes,</v>

410
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 3>they tap out at 1,350</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons.</v>

411
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.430
<v Speaker 3>So if we today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much difference is that weight was.</v>

412
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

413
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about 200 and 200 tons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 200 tons shy.</v>

414
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do to.</v>

415
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

416
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's heavier.</v>

417
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>So using that as the best proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

418
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

419
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 3>that one block for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it the city in Lebanon called bow </v>

420
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>

421
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 3>we've all seen that amazing stone that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in charge of the God the movie.</v>

422
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

423
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Heliopolis,</v>

424
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.830
<v Speaker 4>you've seen it already right beyond you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

425
00:22:00.831 --> 00:22:02.220
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't even wrap your head around it.</v>

426
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.750
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not,</v>

427
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.000
<v Speaker 4>you can't move this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move this.</v>

428
00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:11.001
<v Speaker 4>So you have photos of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it maybe just something that we're </v>

429
00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:11.001
<v Speaker 4>not thinking of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was,</v>

430
00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>underwater at one point it made it </v>

431
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.220
<v Speaker 4>easier to move rocks or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that or this,</v>

432
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.450
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make it easier to move </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to epic.</v>

433
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 4>What would the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

434
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.070
<v Speaker 4>the possibilities are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two in my opinion,</v>

435
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 4>there's his idea that we've been visited</v>
<v Speaker 4>by ancient aliens and then there's the,</v>

436
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.970
<v Speaker 4>the idea that civilization has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>restarted several times and that is that</v>

437
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:38.090
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of a cataclysmic event</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's killed almost everybody except </v>

438
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.320
<v Speaker 4>for a small amount of stragglers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they regrouped and rebuilt and rethought</v>

439
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 4>things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why things</v>

440
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:46.500
<v Speaker 4>come so quickly and technology is moving</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fast and as your mom said,</v>

441
00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:47.850
<v Speaker 4>or whose grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever it was,</v>

442
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 4>that we are relearning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've done this before.</v>

443
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it can also be a combination of </v>

444
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.210
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that?</v>

445
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>

446
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Can I see that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

447
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:00.930
<v Speaker 3>This is the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

448
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.490
<v Speaker 3>this is Baalbek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

449
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:08.491
<v Speaker 3>There's the bow back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the stone of the pregnant </v>

450
00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:12.181
<v Speaker 3>woman and it's one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>monoliths that has ever been seen on </v>

451
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.090
<v Speaker 3>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

452
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me right there,</v>

453
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 3>we could not move this with our modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>day cranes.</v>

454
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.790
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

455
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>something happened in all of the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 3>sites because you know,</v>

456
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>we know there's absolutely no question </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mind that our ancestors,</v>

457
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were extremely smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were ingenious and obviously did </v>

458
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 3>they know how to cut stones and how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>transport them and things like that.</v>

459
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

460
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not really interested in moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>around stones that are cut from </v>

461
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 3>limestone or sandstone and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

462
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.560
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm interested in is stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this where it was cut out of granted or </v>

463
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 3>out of diorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still today.</v>

464
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.420
<v Speaker 3>We use diamond tip saws in order to cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of these blocks that we cut today </v>

465
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 3>and allegedly our ancestors that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>with copper tools.</v>

466
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.010
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere the logic just fails because </v>

467
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.591
<v Speaker 3>there's logic certainly fails that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that technology that we attributed to </v>

468
00:24:16.591 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 3>those people because we have to put them</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bronze age.</v>

469
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 3>And the copper age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't put them in the age of steel,</v>

470
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.780
<v Speaker 3>but to me the logic is much more likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they we were wrong about the age of</v>

471
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 3>bronze and steel and that people had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure it out.</v>

472
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Diverse hip tools like went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't they find markings inside the </v>

473
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 3>sarcophagus and the king's chamber of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Great Pyramid of Giza?</v>

474
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they believe were attributed only </v>

475
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>to diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Head of drill.</v>

476
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Egypt we have a very fascinating </v>

477
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.151
<v Speaker 3>site called Abi Dose and in Abi Dose you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a sorry,</v>

478
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 3>in Aba Zeer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in Dose Abbott doses where they have</v>

479
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:57.101
<v Speaker 3>to do those weird hieroglyphics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Ab Azir you have a what's known </v>

480
00:24:57.101 --> 00:25:01.931
<v Speaker 3>as a signatures of core drills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a core drill is basically if you </v>

481
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:08.291
<v Speaker 3>imagine a steel tube tip with diamonds </v>
<v Speaker 3>that drills itself into the ground or </v>

482
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 3>into the Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you break it free.</v>

483
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.520
<v Speaker 3>You take out that tube and inside of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have like a pipe of that,</v>

484
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 3>a cordial sample of that particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

485
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Now in Abu Azir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find multiple stones where we can see</v>

486
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 3>a signature of these types of machining </v>
<v Speaker 3>that took place there.</v>

487
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Now a lot of people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

488
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all modern day occurrences.</v>

489
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was done.</v>

490
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the first first a modern day core </v>

491
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.620
<v Speaker 3>drill machine was invented in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 19 twenties.</v>

492
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Now when you look at the book that Surf </v>
<v Speaker 3>Flinders Petrie wrote,</v>

493
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 3>that book was written in Nineteen Oh </v>
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>

494
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 3>And it already had drawings of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>core drill holes in them,</v>

495
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.820
<v Speaker 3>which proves that these core drill holes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can find acquisitions are not </v>

496
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:06.761
<v Speaker 3>modern day creations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is absolutely crazy because </v>

497
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:12.491
<v Speaker 3>Christopher done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my colleagues who wrote the Giza </v>

498
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 3>power plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he proved because he's a machinist,</v>

499
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's an engineer and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff like the back of his hand.</v>

500
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like somebody walked along </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

501
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 3>this is how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy,</v>

502
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 3>that's what he does for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He builds machines and he,</v>

503
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

504
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.170
<v Speaker 3>precision mechanisms and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

505
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 3>So he is trained for that kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

506
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 3>investigation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that there is no way that this </v>

507
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 3>could have been done with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

508
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.020
<v Speaker 3>with copper tools.</v>

509
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

510
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.080
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wild,</v>

512
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.720
<v Speaker 3>wild pieces of evidence that we have out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there like in Puma Puma,</v>

513
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.820
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly in the Bolivian highlands at an </v>

514
00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.320
<v Speaker 3>altitude of 12 and a half thousand feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is this magnificent place called </v>

515
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.620
<v Speaker 3>to an ACO that everyday hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tourists arrive there and they look at </v>

516
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:10.641
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it take pictures and then they leave as </v>

517
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:10.641
<v Speaker 3>clueless as they arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

518
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

519
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 3>about 150 200 yards away from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

520
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 3>to knock who there's another site that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much lesser known,</v>

521
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 3>called Puma Puma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

522
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.650
<v Speaker 3>And at Puma Puma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything defies logic is defied at </v>

523
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:32.661
<v Speaker 3>Puma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puma will be caused the blocks of stone </v>

524
00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:32.661
<v Speaker 3>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are pure diorite,</v>

525
00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:37.640
<v Speaker 3>andesite and granted and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are so perfect that we today would </v>

526
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:42.870
<v Speaker 3>have a hard time recreating some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these blocks.</v>

527
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.630
<v Speaker 3>And I actually spoke to a real life </v>
<v Speaker 3>stonemasons.</v>

528
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.730
<v Speaker 3>His name is Roger Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he looked at some of these pictures </v>

529
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.931
<v Speaker 3>that I showed him of Puma Puma crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that not for any amount of </v>

530
00:27:56.931 --> 00:28:00.801
<v Speaker 3>money or for any amount of time would </v>
<v Speaker 3>volunteer to try to replicate some of </v>

531
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 3>these rocks as somebody blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if a real life stone mason says </v>

532
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.610
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean God bless the,</v>

533
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the professors and the archeologists,</v>

534
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.360
<v Speaker 3>but I'd rather listen to someone who cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>stone for a living than someone you know</v>

535
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.180
<v Speaker 3>who stands before a blackboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy who cut stone for a living,</v>

536
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.300
<v Speaker 3>what he said was that it could be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said it would be really hard and he </v>

537
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want to do it for any amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

538
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 3>but that it couldn't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

539
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:31.020
<v Speaker 3>But I wouldn't lead with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with modern day.</v>

540
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not with what?</v>

541
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 3>So with chicken bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we know that if we know that it could</v>

542
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:41.091
<v Speaker 3>be done with modern technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be more likely that modern </v>

543
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:47.541
<v Speaker 3>technology is sort of a recreation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what people did learn in the past and </v>

544
00:28:47.541 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 3>that they probably were wiped out by </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a cataclysmic disaster.</v>

545
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 3>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems way more likely than aliens came </v>

546
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 3>and moved rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

547
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 3>you're saying if like if Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it'd be really,</v>

548
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:58.920
<v Speaker 3>really difficult for people to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

549
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of stuff that will be </v>

550
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.160
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult for people to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

551
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily suggesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting that aliens moved to rocks.</v>

552
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.470
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that the aliens that </v>
<v Speaker 3>visited Earth gave the technology or </v>

553
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:18.470
<v Speaker 3>taught the technology to humans because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they wanted to do is to leave </v>

554
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 3>behind messages that they were here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>

555
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 3>So all those incredible monuments that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have today,</v>

556
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 3>like the Pyramids of Giza or Stonehenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>or Puma Puma for example,</v>

557
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 3>or new grange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these magnificent sights in Cusco,</v>

558
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Machu Picchu in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all those places are messages for a</v>

559
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:46.921
<v Speaker 3>future generation to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>something way different happened in our </v>

560
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the main reason why,</v>

561
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:55.891
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have religions today and things like </v>

562
00:29:55.891 --> 00:29:55.891
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

563
00:29:55.891 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think that pretty much all </v>

564
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>science emanates from some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alien contact?</v>

565
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

566
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 3>no because modern day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

567
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.080
<v Speaker 3>because was a trace of modernist science</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can follow it.</v>

568
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now let's think about this.</v>

569
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.250
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what age do you think people had </v>

570
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 3>technology that sort of any fucking nut </v>
<v Speaker 3>that crashed and the,</v>

571
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the TV show lost crash on an island and </v>

572
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 3>you could recreate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that like maybe 2000,</v>

573
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:27.400
<v Speaker 3>3000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more thousand dollars,</v>

574
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like five,</v>

575
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:34.891
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago they were basically living </v>

576
00:30:34.891 --> 00:30:34.891
<v Speaker 3>like savages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

577
00:30:34.891 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suppose serially supposedly yes.</v>

578
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 3>If you follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's give him even even even early.</v>

579
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

580
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 3>the thing is my point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

581
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point was that if in 10,000</v>

582
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 3>years time people have gone from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>cave dwelling savages that were throwing</v>

583
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 3>pointy sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

584
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 3>moving animals to people with cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phones and the Internet and wireless and</v>

585
00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 3>this is all created pain arguably by </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

586
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a record of all these inventions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these creations.</v>

587
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.900
<v Speaker 3>If this has been achieved over 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

588
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 3>what's to say that there wasn't some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a massive disaster that happened</v>

589
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the last ice age or </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger in in their 20,000</v>

590
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the date it for 15,000,</v>

591
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:20.551
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that technology died and that </v>

592
00:31:20.831 --> 00:31:25.831
<v Speaker 3>civilization died and it had to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinvented by the surviving humans </v>

593
00:31:25.831 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 3>basically from scratch and that even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though human beings have been around for</v>

594
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:30.040
<v Speaker 3>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

595
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 3>long time before that and civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>had evolved to an incredibly high level,</v>

596
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>all that information was lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is way more likely than </v>

597
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 3>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

598
00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 3>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

599
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:47.730
<v Speaker 3>This is where the difference lies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when let's say the Sumerian culture </v>

600
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 3>sprung out of virtually nothing happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually overnight.</v>

601
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:57.030
<v Speaker 3>The Sumerians were very clear in stating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they got their start in </v>

602
00:31:57.731 --> 00:32:02.731
<v Speaker 3>civilization by what they referred to as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the under knocking and the unlock key </v>

603
00:32:02.731 --> 00:32:05.250
<v Speaker 3>translated into English means those who </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the hurricane.</v>

604
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>

605
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that true that that's only by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means Zechariah stitching is pretty</v>

606
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:13.370
<v Speaker 3>much the main scholar of the Sumerian </v>
<v Speaker 3>texts that police.</v>

607
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of other scholars that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>not agree with it.</v>

608
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the translation,</v>

609
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 3>even a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

610
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.380
<v Speaker 3>a quote unquote mainstream scientist or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some neurologist will say that on </v>

611
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 3>knocking means that I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not,</v>

612
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sicker,</v>

613
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:33.721
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did have quite a few things that he </v>

614
00:32:33.721 --> 00:32:33.721
<v Speaker 3>translated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:32:33.721 --> 00:32:35.100
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

616
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 3>so that's definitely a valid point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are the great majority of what</v>

617
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

618
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 4>talking about has been translated </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctly and he has used,</v>

619
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many of the most accessible,</v>

620
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and correct translations that can be </v>

621
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 4>found today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even in the epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

622
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:58.961
<v Speaker 4>don't they refer to a long gone superior</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization that existed before then?</v>

623
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

624
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.220
<v Speaker 4>but that civilization always lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote somewhere else and </v>

625
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.420
<v Speaker 4>integrate dark void.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what's the great dark avoid?</v>

626
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful Pasadena city name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a poetic way of saying compton deep</v>

627
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:22.480
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Compton would've been better for him.</v>

628
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Shit fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

629
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.650
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it is,</v>

630
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you follow me.</v>

631
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

632
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 4>I firmly believe that there's life out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

633
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:33.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the possibility is,</v>

634
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the numbers,</v>

635
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's also very possible that</v>

636
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:42.851
<v Speaker 4>it's reached us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think if you look at what's more </v>

637
00:33:42.851 --> 00:33:46.091
<v Speaker 4>likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we absolutely know that people can </v>

638
00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 4>build a immense structures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we absolutely know that civilization,</v>

639
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely because of all these </v>

640
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>historical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

641
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.500
<v Speaker 4>depictions of natural disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the epic of Gilgamesh or </v>

642
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.471
<v Speaker 4>Noah's Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 100 different cultures that have </v>

643
00:34:02.471 --> 00:34:05.260
<v Speaker 4>stores of apocalyptic disastrous and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>volatile nature of the earth itself.</v>

644
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we know it's covered in </v>
<v Speaker 4>craters,</v>

645
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:12.941
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we know that every plan </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we look at the moon and just see </v>

646
00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:15.281
<v Speaker 4>creators all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know about the shifting of the polar </v>

647
00:34:15.281 --> 00:34:15.281
<v Speaker 4>ice caps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who know about Pangea.</v>

648
00:34:15.281 --> 00:34:19.961
<v Speaker 4>We know that there was intelligent life </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably in some sort of a monkey forum </v>

649
00:34:19.961 --> 00:34:19.961
<v Speaker 4>when Pangea was around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

650
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

651
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:25.541
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a beating for people don't know the </v>

652
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 4>whole entire world is one continent </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fieriness drifted apart.</v>

653
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

654
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.880
<v Speaker 4>I just think that if we know for a fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that human beings are capable now of </v>

655
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.080
<v Speaker 4>doing spectacular things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we have said already that if we </v>

656
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 4>existed 100 years more man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and imagine what we would know.</v>

657
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine what has sprung out over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last hundred,</v>

658
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 4>300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

659
00:34:45.531 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 4>and I think you add a few hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that or a thousand years to that.</v>

660
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 4>It's not unreasonable in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think that 10,000</v>

661
00:34:52.581 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 4>years ago there was some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>event,</v>

662
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:58.050
<v Speaker 4>some sort of catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's $15,000,</v>

663
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:03.060
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck name it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a catastrophic event that fuck this </v>

664
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 4>world sideways and killed almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

665
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:09.670
<v Speaker 4>To me that is just way more likely than </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people got it from some higher </v>

666
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 4>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of them.</v>

667
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.620
<v Speaker 4>A Combo of both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how many different ancient </v>

668
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 4>civilizations tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the people where they got their,</v>

669
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 4>their knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just the Samaritans,</v>

670
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:26.261
<v Speaker 4>they're all telling you there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible monuments that were puzzled </v>

671
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:28.860
<v Speaker 4>us today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're telling you that dudes from Earth,</v>

672
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 4>from the heavens came down and showed </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

673
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:36.551
<v Speaker 4>but no one's bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're also telling you that a guy died </v>

674
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 4>and came back to earth three days later </v>
<v Speaker 4>he turned water into</v>

675
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 3>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these,</v>

676
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 3>these are structures that actually you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see in their scientists.</v>

677
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Baffled by what you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like structures and stuff in South </v>

678
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mayans.</v>

679
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the ancient Sumerian.</v>

680
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

681
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

682
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 3>the Mayans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

683
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 3>they did their shit is totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

684
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:58.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean they believe that a fucking plume</v>
<v Speaker 3>snake created the universe.</v>

685
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second now.</v>

686
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.070
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

687
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.350
<v Speaker 3>What is behind this story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snake mushrooms like a motherfucker in </v>

688
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.980
<v Speaker 3>the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hang it out.</v>

689
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Banging hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My in checks chilling.</v>

690
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Internet.</v>

691
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.500
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely an idea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility playing football with human </v>

692
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.821
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm trying to figure out what are </v>

693
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 3>the realities behind the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think it's a possibility.</v>

694
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ruling out that pause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

695
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

696
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.560
<v Speaker 3>it is definitely a combination because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is that all these </v>

697
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.500
<v Speaker 3>ancient cultures are very adamant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific in saying that this all </v>

698
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:44.400
<v Speaker 3>happened because of a visit from beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the stars.</v>

699
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:50.240
<v Speaker 3>The star thing is very prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it were a previous civilization or if</v>

700
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 3>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

701
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes people say,</v>

702
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:56.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come you don't?</v>

703
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.800
<v Speaker 3>How come you're not talking about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a w.</v>

704
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:04.850
<v Speaker 3>it's our civilization from the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>travel into the past to help us with </v>

705
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 3>certain developments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

706
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.630
<v Speaker 3>that can't be true because nowhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient texts do we find any </v>

707
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 3>reference where it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

708
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 3>we're just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're from the future.</v>

709
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe future bullshit artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's those little gray dudes.</v>

710
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Are they just completely full of Shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're us from the future,</v>

711
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 3>but they fuck with us the same way we </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck with monkeys.</v>

712
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get in the cage,</v>

713
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:33.591
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a banana and the monkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets in the cage and you just steal </v>

714
00:37:33.591 --> 00:37:33.591
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take them to the zoo,</v>

715
00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.880
<v Speaker 3>given that banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

716
00:37:34.881 --> 00:37:34.990
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

717
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing about Zachariah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially when people questioned his </v>

718
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.371
<v Speaker 3>translations are the things that he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the seventies and they were </v>

719
00:37:43.371 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 3>finding out just today in 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

720
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:50.451
<v Speaker 3>2002,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in the stories that he's talking </v>

721
00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:50.451
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the adult hockey,</v>

722
00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:53.770
<v Speaker 3>he saying in a nutshell that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper advanced wraith is created us as </v>

723
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 3>slaves to mine gold because they needed </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold dust particles to suspend them.</v>

724
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:01.190
<v Speaker 3>An atmosphere to protect our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

725
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 3>we just discovered in the 2000 thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

726
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 3>you actually do protect atmospheres by </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspending metallic product.</v>

727
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 3>How the hell did an archeologist know </v>
<v Speaker 3>some astrophysics in the seventies?</v>

728
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.160
<v Speaker 3>That's an intention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

729
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Well it is possible that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>really sophisticated seven,</v>

730
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:22.851
<v Speaker 3>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and they knew that we were </v>

731
00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 3>eventually going to run into the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems again.</v>

732
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:28.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they were burning shit back then </v>

733
00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:30.801
<v Speaker 3>that was eating up the ozone layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were fucking with chemicals </v>

734
00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:30.801
<v Speaker 3>back then just like we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that.</v>

735
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 3>So that would mean that were super </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

736
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're telling you specifically</v>

737
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 4>the reason why they to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

738
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

739
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.090
<v Speaker 4>they figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured it out,</v>

740
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 4>just like we figured it out now and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured it out then.</v>

741
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're telling you how they figured</v>

742
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:50.371
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're saying they're saying they got </v>

743
00:38:50.371 --> 00:38:50.371
<v Speaker 4>it from the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Again,</v>

744
00:38:50.371 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

745
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about language to </v>

746
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 4>argue against or for switching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know that he's a road scholar.</v>

747
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 3>He's not the only one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean again,</v>

748
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:05.580
<v Speaker 3>knockier to Sumerian stories are not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only stories that we find constraints </v>

749
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.710
<v Speaker 3>for evidence Dogan mean they completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>such detailed astronomical knowledge </v>

750
00:39:13.531 --> 00:39:15.810
<v Speaker 3>which was not corroborated it until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

751
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.410
<v Speaker 3>early 19 sixties and there's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that say,</v>

752
00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:24.411
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a complete hoax when it really </v>

753
00:39:24.411 --> 00:39:26.480
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they knew about invisible stars </v>

754
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.110
<v Speaker 3>that were then later truly corroborated </v>
<v Speaker 3>by NASA and other astrophysicists.</v>

755
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how on earth would they know something </v>

756
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.091
<v Speaker 3>like this and the Dogan give you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers that they were visited by </v>

757
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:43.101
<v Speaker 3>somebody that descended from the sky and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then who are we to say that these people</v>

758
00:39:44.191 --> 00:39:49.191
<v Speaker 3>are lying or that they made up fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories because that to me is the </v>

759
00:39:49.191 --> 00:39:49.680
<v Speaker 3>insult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

760
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.060
<v Speaker 3>When people,</v>

761
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 4>we'll say salt the fuck out of some old </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes.</v>

762
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

763
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no snakes.</v>

764
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm just referring to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 3>because because people archeologist the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunkers are saying,</v>

766
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:01.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

767
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:06.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys attribute everything to alien </v>

768
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.710
<v Speaker 3>intervention and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.560
<v Speaker 3>you undermine to human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human ingenuity.</v>

770
00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 3>You're suggesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 3>our ancestors were stupid and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nothing could be further from the </v>

772
00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.421
<v Speaker 3>truth because obviously nothing happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our brain development in the last </v>

773
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 3>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

774
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:24.100
<v Speaker 3>If you bring someone from 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago to today,</v>

775
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 3>you can teach that person how to drive a</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

776
00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:30.820
<v Speaker 3>You can teach that person even to fly a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane,</v>

777
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.210
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because intellectually speaking they're </v>

778
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 3>as capable as we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

779
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:43.140
<v Speaker 3>there was one huge difference and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is their technological frame of </v>

780
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 3>reference was different or smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we have today.</v>

781
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:52.020
<v Speaker 3>So when we have stories of flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>shields or dragons or smoking a snakes </v>

782
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:57.730
<v Speaker 3>and plumes and plume snakes and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

783
00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 3>then my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

784
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:04.411
<v Speaker 3>what was it exactly that our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to describe with their vocabulary </v>

785
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't have the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 3>for rocket or for,</v>

786
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had to liken a rocket to a </v>

787
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 3>blazing oven or something like this or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

788
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:18.010
<v Speaker 3>gleaming bronze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a monster and things like that.</v>

789
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 3>So there in lies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lies the big difference.</v>

790
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:23.650
<v Speaker 3>And so when archeologists and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

791
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:28.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that I undermine human </v>

792
00:41:28.651 --> 00:41:29.570
<v Speaker 3>ingenuity from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

793
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:34.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not because I am reading to </v>

794
00:41:34.571 --> 00:41:37.501
<v Speaker 3>you exactly that these same people said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they received their knowledge from </v>

795
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 3>these humanoid beings that the senate </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the sky.</v>

796
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 3>So you think that that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

797
00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:48.180
<v Speaker 3>the most compelling piece of evidence to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you is a human beings depictions of what</v>

798
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 3>was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like given us or you know.</v>

799
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:52.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

800
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 3>that is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that,</v>

801
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's the great thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient alien theory that you can,</v>

802
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such an interdisciplinary field of </v>

803
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 3>research that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.990
<v Speaker 3>you can look at ancient Egypt and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can look at South America and draw </v>

805
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:10.230
<v Speaker 3>correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they did.</v>

806
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 3>They found crazy correlations between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those two cultures,</v>

807
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:19.091
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they found cocaine in mummies and </v>

808
00:42:19.091 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 3>things like that where cocaine was only </v>
<v Speaker 3>available in one country.</v>

809
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.970
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was definitely,</v>

810
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something definitely happened that there</v>

811
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:31.211
<v Speaker 3>was trade between continents and </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally I suggest that trait didn't </v>

812
00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 3>necessarily happen on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on water,</v>

813
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.870
<v Speaker 3>but that they actually had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 3>aircraft because that is what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient texts are saying,</v>

815
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 3>not only in India with the vimanas but </v>
<v Speaker 3>also in,</v>

816
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Hebrew and an Ethiopian cultures.</v>

817
00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Have you have the story of King Solomon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his flying carpet and it's flying </v>

818
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.971
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't your show take an artifact and </v>

819
00:42:57.971 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 3>recreated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain that.</v>

820
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about what happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

821
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 3>where was the artifact from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from South America,</v>

822
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:07.961
<v Speaker 3>from Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a gold funerary objects.</v>

823
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a totem that hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of those little artifacts </v>

824
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:19.631
<v Speaker 3>have been found and they will usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaped in the form of frogs and insects </v>

825
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 3>and fish and crocodiles and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

826
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.750
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of those thousands of funerary </v>

827
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.751
<v Speaker 3>objects that have been found about eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>were found worldwide that looked like </v>

828
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:37.631
<v Speaker 3>modern day airplanes and so these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineers in one,</v>

829
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:42.990
<v Speaker 3>one doctor and one engineer in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they did is in the early,</v>

830
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 3>in the mid nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1996,</v>

831
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:50.021
<v Speaker 3>they took one of those little funerary </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects and they blew it up to ratio and</v>

832
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>to size without adding an inch or </v>
<v Speaker 3>subtracting an inch.</v>

833
00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just basically blew it up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>about three to four feet long and it </v>

834
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 3>looks exactly like exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>

835
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 3>They put a propeller inside and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried multiple objects.</v>

836
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:11.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't just do one that they </v>

837
00:44:11.531 --> 00:44:11.531
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

838
00:44:11.531 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 3>this one is most likely like a looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely like a plane,</v>

839
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.390
<v Speaker 3>so let's just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well No,</v>

840
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:16.900
<v Speaker 3>they took a whole bunch of them and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreated them as,</v>

841
00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 3>as model planes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A throw them up in the air and they were</v>

842
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:26.111
<v Speaker 3>100 percent aerodynamically sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were able to do roles and looping </v>

843
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 3>loops and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

844
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>they were 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

845
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were airplanes and even to the </v>

846
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 3>untrained eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

847
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.560
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like planes because here's the</v>

848
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:45.561
<v Speaker 3>thing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people say about when they say </v>

849
00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 3>that these are also fish or insects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you look at that,</v>

850
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:54.021
<v Speaker 3>that's an airplane because first of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a delta shape and a fuselage </v>

851
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.600
<v Speaker 3>and then you have the stabilizers in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and you've got an upright rudder </v>

852
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.070
<v Speaker 3>and no living creature in nature does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not exist.</v>

853
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Plus the wing formation is a low wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>formation.</v>

854
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Where would have wings are attached to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the fuselage body.</v>

855
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have our wings are arms attached </v>

856
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the birds and the shoulder girdle.</v>

857
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.750
<v Speaker 3>And that formation that we can find in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Colombian artifact does not.</v>

858
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't suggest how old is that </v>

859
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 3>artifact?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thousand 500 to 1000,</v>

860
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.490
<v Speaker 3>600 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Dang.</v>

861
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So totally.</v>

862
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.611
<v Speaker 3>My region in Columbia and Pre-colombian </v>
<v Speaker 3>artifact and it's uh,</v>

863
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:46.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so those are all those little things </v>

864
00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 3>that all fit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some how,</v>

865
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:54.350
<v Speaker 3>and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had something to do with flesh and </v>

866
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 3>blood aliens who visited in the remote </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

867
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird that our history is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>incomplete.</v>

868
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're having this debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we're having this debate </v>

869
00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 3>is because we know that the history so </v>
<v Speaker 3>sketchy when you get just a few thousand</v>

870
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all he fucking knows,</v>

871
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:08.100
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

872
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:13.310
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't help when you get these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conventional archaeologists that are so </v>

873
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 3>fucking set in their ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

874
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:20.450
<v Speaker 3>this Robert Schoch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Anthony West thing that's going on </v>

875
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.450
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

876
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:25.190
<v Speaker 3>pertaining to the dating of the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find their research fascinating.</v>

877
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:30.201
<v Speaker 3>What I find more fascinating is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>these mainstream egyptologist just just </v>

878
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 3>poo poo it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

879
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:36.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well where's the evidence for this </v>

880
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.170
<v Speaker 3>culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

881
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.531
<v Speaker 3>the argument they had was so childish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so egotistical that guy was </v>

882
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 3>standing up going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the Sphinx being </v>
<v Speaker 3>predating,</v>

884
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:43.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>

885
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:48.741
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the evidence of this culture </v>

886
00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:48.741
<v Speaker 3>that's willing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the evidence?</v>

887
00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you think is going to </v>

888
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:52.070
<v Speaker 3>be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir?</v>

889
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going to be there </v>
<v Speaker 3>after 11,000</v>

890
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking 9,000</v>

891
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is going to be left?</v>

892
00:46:55.981 --> 00:47:00.981
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what's going to be left </v>

893
00:47:00.981 --> 00:47:02.630
<v Speaker 3>rocks and there's your evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>geological ropps that are so fucked up </v>

894
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.240
<v Speaker 3>by water that it has to be thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of rainfall,</v>

895
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 3>you know that is unanimous.</v>

896
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:12.350
<v Speaker 3>When geologists look at the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>enclosure and they and they show of </v>

897
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 3>photographs of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water erosion of the fishers,</v>

898
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.680
<v Speaker 3>they're 100 percent agreed that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>water erosion due to thousands of years </v>

899
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 3>of rain fall by the way rainfall to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just flooding,</v>

900
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 3>not like one crazy flood know thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>or many years,</v>

901
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.800
<v Speaker 3>so that just shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be older than 9,000</v>

902
00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.600
<v Speaker 3>bc because that was the last time there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was flooding or there's a rain forest in</v>

903
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:42.601
<v Speaker 3>the Nile Valley know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing is also that their </v>

904
00:47:42.601 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 3>research is corroborated by other </v>
<v Speaker 3>research as well.</v>

905
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:49.381
<v Speaker 3>When my colleague Robert Boulevard came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out with the Orion mystery and when he </v>

906
00:47:49.381 --> 00:47:54.210
<v Speaker 3>suggested that if you look at the great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three great pyramids of Giza from a </v>

907
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 3>bird's eye perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that the three are sort of lined</v>

908
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 3>up but not completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not in a straight line.</v>

909
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 3>At the smallest pyramid is a bit off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

910
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:07.210
<v Speaker 3>well that's really strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's going on here?</v>

911
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:12.211
<v Speaker 3>And then he determined that these three </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids are in fact built to the exact </v>

912
00:48:12.211 --> 00:48:15.370
<v Speaker 3>ratio of Orion to three stars in Orion's</v>
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>

913
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.900
<v Speaker 3>The band heard though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the only way you could see the </v>

914
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.091
<v Speaker 3>three stars from that angle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have to look at everything </v>

915
00:48:24.091 --> 00:48:27.570
<v Speaker 3>upside down from like like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't actually work that way,</v>

916
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 3>but it was disproven that you can you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see it that way,</v>

917
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 3>but not from Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not from.</v>

918
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Not from the way we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have reverse </v>

919
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:39.690
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

920
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at the general idea still </v>

921
00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:47.221
<v Speaker 3>holds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though that the upside down theory </v>

922
00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 3>is possibly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not sure of that,</v>

923
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:51.580
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what either I a video.</v>

924
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I think however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he did determine is the fact that </v>

925
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.910
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were to put three floodlights on </v>

926
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 3>top of each tip of the pyramid and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire it straight into the sky,</v>

927
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at the bookstore in Las Vegas,</v>

928
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:11.010
<v Speaker 3>the big been the time when the three </v>
<v Speaker 3>tips of those pyramids would line up </v>

929
00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:17.011
<v Speaker 3>exactly with Orion spelled and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>software for this where you can rewind </v>

930
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.260
<v Speaker 3>back the night sky and the computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>

931
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be in 12,500,</v>

932
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 3>12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 years ago,</v>

933
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:31.920
<v Speaker 3>which bore a labeled or is known </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptology as the golden age when the </v>

934
00:49:33.911 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 3>gods still walked amongst men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact that the pyramid,</v>

935
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Sphinx also eight to 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

936
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>well that's 1200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the golden age that everybody </v>

937
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>talks about in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

938
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really learned thousand BC thousands</v>

939
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 3>of years earlier.</v>

940
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.320
<v Speaker 3>It has to exist because of the thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years of rainfall.</v>

941
00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 3>So you are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be 10,500</v>

942
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 11 or so.</v>

943
00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:02.041
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are ancient texts that talk </v>

944
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.770
<v Speaker 3>about these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

945
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.640
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

946
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.250
<v Speaker 3>these previous cultures or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous,</v>

947
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:08.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

948
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 3>periods of other kings and that lived in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptian,</v>

949
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 3>a region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're considered to be fantasy </v>

950
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:24.241
<v Speaker 3>stories by archeologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Pharaohs just like 34,000</v>

951
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:26.560
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't there?</v>

952
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe John Anthony West has stated </v>

953
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:31.860
<v Speaker 3>that he goes back almost 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or more years.</v>

954
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.760
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a king's list out there and </v>

955
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.030
<v Speaker 3>everybody can go google this tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called WB 44.</v>

956
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.540
<v Speaker 3>And that kings list absolutely will </v>
<v Speaker 3>boggle your mind because it basically </v>

957
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:49.030
<v Speaker 3>lists a combined age of kings that ruled</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a half a million years before our </v>

958
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's absolutely,</v>

959
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

960
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and that is a list that can be found at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the British Museum in England,</v>

961
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>in London.</v>

962
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Where's it from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from some area and the WB 44.</v>

963
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 3>And it lists for how long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long,</v>

964
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:15.140
<v Speaker 3>how old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

965
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 3>And some of these kings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

966
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I have root for 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years for 48,000</v>

967
00:51:21.351 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day,</v>

968
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 3>one king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>

969
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:29.201
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this even possible that operate </v>

970
00:51:29.201 --> 00:51:29.201
<v Speaker 3>the great type shit that were working </v>
<v Speaker 3>that back then,</v>

971
00:51:29.201 --> 00:51:29.970
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they are,</v>

972
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dilation,</v>

973
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dilation.</v>

974
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 3>If you travel at close to the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>

975
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:41.500
<v Speaker 3>if on your spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five years pass and you travel at 99 </v>

976
00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:44.540
<v Speaker 3>point nine percent of the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>

977
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years pass here on earth.</v>

978
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the theory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>relativity,</v>

979
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 3>which is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

980
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.580
<v Speaker 3>and it takes a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dilation into account.</v>

981
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anyone that flies a lot,</v>

982
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 3>those people are actually aging slower </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the rest of us.</v>

983
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 3>So the more you are in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the slower you age.</v>

984
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.860
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a mathematically viable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and proven theory that if you travel </v>

985
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

986
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 3>which of course we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are not capable of doing it.</v>

987
00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:22.370
<v Speaker 3>But just because we human beings can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it doesn't mean it does not exist.</v>

988
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's the big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

989
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 3>arc is dude would like come down here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck some shit and go yo,</v>

990
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it comes back like 16,000</v>

991
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:33.650
<v Speaker 3>years because to him it's only a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

992
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes to the speed of light or </v>

993
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he comes back.</v>

994
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it sounds like science fiction.</v>

995
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.160
<v Speaker 3>But who says that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not possible.</v>

996
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting way to stay valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just say,</v>

997
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:52.751
<v Speaker 3>listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am coming back and then you actually </v>

998
00:52:52.751 --> 00:52:55.721
<v Speaker 3>do come back and don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are the stories that we find </v>

999
00:52:55.721 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 3>that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote gods,</v>

1000
00:52:56.601 --> 00:52:58.430
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never existed.</v>

1001
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.110
<v Speaker 3>It's all lower case g,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as God's.</v>

1002
00:53:02.111 --> 00:53:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1003
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 3>it's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1004
00:53:04.641 --> 00:53:09.641
<v Speaker 3>it was a complete misunderstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a misinterpretation of our ancestors who</v>

1005
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 3>didn't understand the nuts and bolts </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies behind these visits.</v>

1006
00:53:14.481 --> 00:53:19.481
<v Speaker 3>And so they started to worship these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and those visitors knew exactly </v>

1007
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 3>that they were being worshiped because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:27.491
<v Speaker 3>it will be the same thing that if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrive on a planet one day in the </v>

1009
00:53:27.491 --> 00:53:27.530
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$5,000</v>

1010
00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 3>or whatever years from now and we find a</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote intelligent species,</v>

1011
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>but they're a bit primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:36.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1013
00:53:36.031 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 3>we'll push them a little bit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right direction,</v>

1014
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.020
<v Speaker 3>show them how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 3>to complete agriculture and medicine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture and all those things.</v>

1016
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1017
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna disappear again.</v>

1018
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our once real visit will turn into will </v>

1019
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:58.370
<v Speaker 3>enter the realm of mythology a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>or 2000 years after our visit.</v>

1020
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.920
<v Speaker 3>And so one day all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all human beings will become ancient </v>

1021
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 3>astronauts on some other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1022
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:08.720
<v Speaker 3>it's just the eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have a question of,</v>

1023
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:12.680
<v Speaker 3>you're a master of ancient cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most ancient culture to get,</v>

1024
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 3>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up close to the engine cultures,</v>

1025
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:20.870
<v Speaker 3>have some kind of 2012 a warning or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>signifies the end of some age.</v>

1026
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Or what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1028
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really need you to pay attention to </v>

1029
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.301
<v Speaker 3>this because I think that the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat that we face on December 22nd </v>

1030
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Speaker 3>2012 is the massive hangover will all be</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

1031
00:54:43.351 --> 00:54:48.351
<v Speaker 3>So that's about it because a lot of 2012</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff with a Zacharias of course.</v>

1032
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.790
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1033
00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.280
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing that would message and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think through was gonna,</v>

1034
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though took a year away,</v>

1035
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.610
<v Speaker 3>when we build it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1036
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1037
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:07.671
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion is nothing else but a </v>

1038
00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:07.671
<v Speaker 3>complete.</v>

1039
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1040
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a mass hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1041
00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Because now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1042
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1043
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.080
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1044
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:21.081
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote right before or a year before </v>

1045
00:55:21.081 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 3>he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he rephrased his,</v>

1046
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:24.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory by saying that if,</v>

1047
00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:26.550
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if at all in the bureau were to return,</v>

1048
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be around 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>36 or 38 or something changed it.</v>

1049
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1050
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:38.030
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's neither here nor there because </v>

1051
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.330
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is that the big problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with 2012 is the fact that it's not even</v>

1052
00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 3>2011 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what nobody talks about,</v>

1053
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1054
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.680
<v Speaker 3>our calendar is wrong because if there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of arguments that you can make,</v>

1055
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:53.750
<v Speaker 3>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1056
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 3>if you look at our code and code </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1057
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>we went from one BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1058
00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:03.471
<v Speaker 3>one add without a year zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that we are already at least</v>

1059
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:09.231
<v Speaker 3>by one year off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's either 2012 or ready or it's </v>

1060
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:09.231
<v Speaker 3>still 2010.</v>

1061
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:14.000
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know whether or not our </v>

1062
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.181
<v Speaker 3>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also know that Jesus was not born in </v>

1063
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:23.691
<v Speaker 3>the year zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but scholars and I'm talking </v>

1064
00:56:23.691 --> 00:56:23.930
<v Speaker 3>theologians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>theological scholars now have determined</v>

1065
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:28.950
<v Speaker 3>that Jesus was born between five and </v>
<v Speaker 3>three add.</v>

1066
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>So right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're worn exactly.</v>

1067
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 3>So right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got another five years considering</v>

1068
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:40.240
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we were being told that </v>
<v Speaker 3>our calendar began ticking on the day of</v>

1069
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Jesus's birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So long story short in the third,</v>

1070
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:49.380
<v Speaker 3>our third argument is also that it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>now Berkeley scholars and scholars in </v>

1071
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.950
<v Speaker 3>the university in a university in Rome </v>
<v Speaker 3>have determined that in the Middle Ages </v>

1072
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.400
<v Speaker 3>when the monks were in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>recording our dates and everything like </v>

1073
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they also made a mistake up to five</v>

1074
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.480
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the interesting thing is that to make</v>

1075
00:57:12.671 --> 00:57:17.671
<v Speaker 3>a long story short that we could be as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far off as 10 years with our current </v>

1076
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:23.521
<v Speaker 3>date and if you take into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 3>when did our calendar really start </v>

1077
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 3>ticking?</v>

1078
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Was it at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time when Jesus died or was it at</v>

1079
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 3>the time when he was nailed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross?</v>

1080
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Who knows these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some have suggested that we're </v>

1081
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 3>off by 200 years and these are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that,</v>

1082
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:41.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just pulling this stuff out of their</v>

1083
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.620
<v Speaker 3>butts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are scholars at universities </v>

1084
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 3>who have studied this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the bottom line is that the whole</v>

1085
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.750
<v Speaker 3>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing else but complete hysteria </v>

1086
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 3>and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me repeat.</v>

1087
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely nothing will happen next </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1088
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you got to talk to Daniel Pinchbeck</v>

1089
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 3>because he's written books and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't agree with you.</v>

1090
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:10.800
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks quite so positive and God </v>

1091
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:10.800
<v Speaker 3>bless them and quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So creditable,</v>

1092
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 3>not come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1093
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 3>that didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1094
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.190
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quizlet.</v>

1095
00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Corrado was an exit terrestrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship.</v>

1096
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1097
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they predict that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mayans pr accurately predicted the </v>

1098
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.940
<v Speaker 3>solar lunar eclipses in the future.</v>

1099
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:33.300
<v Speaker 3>So if they predicted that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it possible that we say they </v>

1100
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:33.300
<v Speaker 3>predicted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1101
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 3>We must be following their timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If following their timeline,</v>

1102
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.430
<v Speaker 3>then the must be 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1103
00:58:39.431 --> 00:58:40.660
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1104
00:58:40.661 --> 00:58:45.661
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if our calendar from the very beginning </v>

1105
00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is wrong,</v>

1106
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 3>then we are basing our wrong calendar on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their calculation.</v>

1107
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we're basing our wrong calendar </v>

1108
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 3>on their calculations and it lines up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with what we call 19,</v>

1109
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 3>19 with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call it 2012,</v>

1110
00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 3>then shouldn't it be that they got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunar eclipses right?</v>

1111
00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 3>So they got 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1112
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely have 2012.</v>

1113
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1114
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1115
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but not yes in their counting in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>town but not ours.</v>

1116
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how is their accounting like line up</v>

1117
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:23.191
<v Speaker 3>exactly with ours when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction of solar and lunar eclipses </v>

1118
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:23.191
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1119
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 3>soon and lunar eclipses it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what you're in.</v>

1120
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

1121
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:31.890
<v Speaker 3>they accurately depicted the year that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the solar and lunar eclipses according </v>

1122
00:59:32.691 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 3>to our talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we impose,</v>

1123
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.500
<v Speaker 3>we super imposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're counting onto ours.</v>

1124
00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 3>So we tried to make it fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1125
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:41.580
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1126
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 3>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the other thing that's tricky</v>

1127
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:49.841
<v Speaker 3>when you get to calendars to right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one a completely different type of </v>

1128
00:59:49.841 --> 00:59:53.800
<v Speaker 3>calendar than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there must be something happened </v>

1129
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 3>and then to December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first 2012,</v>

1130
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 3>I must signify at the end of the 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

1131
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 3>And that is the long couch and that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact thing that you know,</v>

1132
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 3>the Mayans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not once,</v>

1133
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>not once did they ever say that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world was going to end.</v>

1134
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:14.411
<v Speaker 3>The only thing they said is that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time ends and a new period of </v>

1135
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 3>time begins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it could be that you know,</v>

1136
01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:23.261
<v Speaker 3>if you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people believe that time has a </v>

1137
01:00:23.261 --> 01:00:26.311
<v Speaker 3>certain qualities to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are times when things are </v>

1138
01:00:26.311 --> 01:00:28.871
<v Speaker 3>easier and times and things are harder </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this is literally like an ebb </v>

1139
01:00:28.871 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 3>and flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the tines and that perhaps with the</v>

1140
01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:35.531
<v Speaker 3>Mayans were predicting is just some new </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage of humanity,</v>

1141
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:40.631
<v Speaker 3>some new stage of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some new states with the earth and the </v>

1142
01:00:40.631 --> 01:00:43.091
<v Speaker 3>universe that this thing just things </v>
<v Speaker 3>just keep flowing in this sort of a </v>

1143
01:00:43.091 --> 01:00:43.091
<v Speaker 3>circular direction.</v>

1144
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1145
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at everything as we know is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is cyclical.</v>

1146
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:50.020
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is definitely in this.</v>

1147
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.100
<v Speaker 3>They mastered the procession of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equinoxes and they had figured that out.</v>

1148
01:00:55.130 --> 01:01:00.130
<v Speaker 3>They had figured out a lot of cycles </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would really complex who taught </v>

1149
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:03.791
<v Speaker 3>them this and they're also very true </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and a lot of free time also.</v>

1150
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 3>So the aliens who were dressed up as </v>
<v Speaker 3>little mushroom mascot,</v>

1151
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:13.010
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you say to people that say,</v>

1152
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:17.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we know Jesus really even exist?</v>

1153
01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.660
<v Speaker 3>They're like dvds and stuff that did was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that DVD,</v>

1154
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:25.690
<v Speaker 3>the God that God wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that there was a lot of kind </v>

1155
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 3>of argue scientifically that he's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a real figure.</v>

1156
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1157
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I personally think that Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent was a historical figure.</v>

1158
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 3>He was an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1159
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1160
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.520
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and neither was Buddha and neither were </v>

1161
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:41.560
<v Speaker 3>any of the other quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 3>astronaut.</v>

1162
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1163
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1164
01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Jesus was a historical figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was able to move people,</v>

1165
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1166
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1167
01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:53.360
<v Speaker 3>he was the son of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

1168
01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 3>is nonsense because we are all the sons </v>
<v Speaker 3>and daughters of God.</v>

1169
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.710
<v Speaker 3>We all have the divine within our </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts.</v>

1170
01:01:58.711 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 3>So what kind of proof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1171
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you've studied a lot of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures,</v>

1172
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you know of any proof that.</v>

1173
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 3>What did Jesus exist exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1174
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had,</v>

1175
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:14.470
<v Speaker 3>we have stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have texts that have been written </v>

1176
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 3>down at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1177
01:02:15.651 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 3>like the Qumran texts to have the Dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sea scrolls and things like that.</v>

1178
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1179
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 3>obviously nobody took a picture and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1180
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 3>there are some in Texas where you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>real squirrely because the dead sea </v>

1181
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.781
<v Speaker 3>scrolls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's the trace it back to </v>

1182
01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:35.661
<v Speaker 3>an ancient Sumerian where Christ is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Sumerian word that means a </v>

1183
01:02:35.661 --> 01:02:35.810
<v Speaker 3>mushroom covered in God's semen.</v>

1184
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting on Marco Allegro Story.</v>

1185
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although interestingly enough,</v>

1186
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:46.490
<v Speaker 3>what's also fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what many people don't know is that </v>

1187
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 3>before Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were 15 other crucified,</v>

1188
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:54.051
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote saviors in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's all very bizarre that,</v>

1189
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1190
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Christianity claims that he was the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>one which is completely untrue.</v>

1191
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.860
<v Speaker 3>And when you measure his story next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other stores,</v>

1192
01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even Hercules,</v>

1193
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Hercules and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucking close.</v>

1194
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Lot of Goddamn similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1195
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1196
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious that we've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>been looking for a savior.</v>

1197
01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I've always been looking for a one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one thing.</v>

1198
01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:22.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's just some Alpha male </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee thing.</v>

1199
01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 3>When you look for the Alpha and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think somehow,</v>

1200
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one at one point in time there was a</v>

1201
01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 3>super alpha and the Super Alpha had all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the answers.</v>

1202
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it just a myth to keep people going?</v>

1203
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the need for this,</v>

1204
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:41.190
<v Speaker 3>this Super Alpha?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it signifies this </v>

1205
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.160
<v Speaker 3>alien intervention in human history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're.</v>

1206
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you personally believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1207
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that a lot of times people </v>

1208
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:54.321
<v Speaker 3>are not happy with their own thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they need to,</v>

1209
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.870
<v Speaker 3>but this Athena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time,</v>

1210
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 3>there was a god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The theme exists in all of them.</v>

1211
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:06.890
<v Speaker 3>All of the different religions all talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about one point in time there was a god </v>

1212
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:09.810
<v Speaker 3>and this God had all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the shit that he wrote down,</v>

1213
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.310
<v Speaker 3>but this is the shit that he told me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that you know,</v>

1214
01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1215
01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>if you want to look at the Old Testament</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we have a description of quote </v>

1216
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 3>unquote God in the ancient astronaut </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>

1217
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 3>whatever or whoever with described in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament,</v>

1218
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 3>and this is exclusively referring to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old Testament,</v>

1219
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.220
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with you'll shit.</v>

1220
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whatever or whoever was described </v>

1221
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.520
<v Speaker 3>in the old testament by all means was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not God.</v>

1222
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.280
<v Speaker 3>That being or that humanoid x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1223
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:47.290
<v Speaker 3>a creature that was here was </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted or thought as God as </v>

1224
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 3>something divine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something spiritual,</v>

1225
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:57.681
<v Speaker 3>something more advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 100 percent Jesus because Jesus </v>

1226
01:04:57.681 --> 01:04:58.470
<v Speaker 3>was an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1227
01:04:58.471 --> 01:05:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I just said that has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the New Testament,</v>

1228
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old testament.</v>

1229
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 3>God was an alien and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1230
01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.780
<v Speaker 3>it was not god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that I thought it was </v>

1231
01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because see,</v>

1232
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1233
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:16.740
<v Speaker 3>does that mean you were an atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean you don't believe in God?</v>

1234
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of the bunkers,</v>

1235
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:24.990
<v Speaker 3>or actually creationists are always </v>
<v Speaker 3>using Albert Einstein as their best </v>

1236
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they say,</v>

1237
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 3>see even Albert Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes in God,</v>

1238
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we must be right with our ideas.</v>

1239
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is only half of the story because </v>

1240
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 3>when Albert Einstein was asked as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist,</v>

1241
01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a journalist asked Albert Einstein,</v>

1242
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 3>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What Einstein said,</v>

1243
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:54.270
<v Speaker 3>and anyone can go and look this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that he replied by saying,</v>

1244
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear journalist,</v>

1245
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.120
<v Speaker 3>before I can answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to define what your definition </v>

1246
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 3>or your idea of God is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the journalists said,</v>

1247
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the Old Testament,</v>

1248
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 3>God and creator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Albert said,</v>

1249
01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that is your definition of God,</v>

1250
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.080
<v Speaker 3>than I respectfully will tell you that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not believe in God and Tony's like </v>

1251
01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:25.270
<v Speaker 3>wells in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are you talking about?</v>

1252
01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>An Einstein then explained his </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition are his idea of God and the </v>

1253
01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>universe and the order that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

1254
01:06:32.551 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 3>And it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1255
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.960
<v Speaker 3>and if that is what what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this to me is my idea of God,</v>

1256
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 3>that there is some order to the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1257
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 3>God does not throw dice.</v>

1258
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.860
<v Speaker 3>That's one of his most famous quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there in lies the difference that,</v>

1259
01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:55.861
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that there is an all </v>

1260
01:06:55.861 --> 01:06:57.370
<v Speaker 3>encompassing force out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a personal god,</v>

1261
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 3>it's not where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1262
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I pray and then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1263
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm praying for something to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that to me is a waste of time to </v>

1264
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:11.161
<v Speaker 3>be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you want something to </v>

1265
01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.801
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta go out there and do it </v>

1266
01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:15.721
<v Speaker 3>yourself no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the reason why the idea of </v>

1267
01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:19.231
<v Speaker 3>prayer exists is because people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest things with their own thoughts </v>

1268
01:07:19.231 --> 01:07:22.771
<v Speaker 3>and staying positive and focusing on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>goal and make yes to a certain extent </v>

1269
01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:23.310
<v Speaker 3>but thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1270
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.160
<v Speaker 3>but that to me is just thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of prayer,</v>

1271
01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:28.890
<v Speaker 3>prayer is just advanced thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1272
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Just a moment to the moment that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that they're in,</v>

1273
01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets wacky.</v>

1274
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Because the moment that you correlate </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own power,</v>

1275
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:40.120
<v Speaker 3>your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1276
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:45.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the connection to the universe that you </v>

1277
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:48.661
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment that you connect that to a </v>

1278
01:07:48.661 --> 01:07:49.870
<v Speaker 3>personal God and put everything that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1279
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 3>you basically deny all responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>

1280
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:55.810
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

1281
01:07:55.930 --> 01:08:00.930
<v Speaker 3>God will take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is such a cop out attitude.</v>

1282
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.040
<v Speaker 3>why know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be responsible for your own actions and </v>

1284
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 3>don't rely on someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

1285
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 3>But I think that that's where the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of prayer came from.</v>

1286
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:18.841
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it exists to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can sort of make things </v>

1287
01:08:18.841 --> 01:08:20.180
<v Speaker 3>happen if you focus on them for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

1288
01:08:20.181 --> 01:08:25.181
<v Speaker 3>And people who have been successful at </v>
<v Speaker 3>making things happen have like stepped </v>

1289
01:08:25.181 --> 01:08:25.181
<v Speaker 3>back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1290
01:08:25.181 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made this happen by prayer.</v>

1291
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 3>We've thought this through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we get a crop top or open it up?</v>

1292
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I'll just need one stop coughing for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little second.</v>

1293
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Poor little sicky Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1294
01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:40.841
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been doing this for a long time </v>

1295
01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:40.841
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said 1998.</v>

1296
01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You started out your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1297
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.060
<v Speaker 3>your magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get approached to be doing </v>

1298
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:46.060
<v Speaker 3>this ancient alien show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does this happen?</v>

1299
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Did they just seek out people with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1300
01:08:48.201 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 3>sort of fringe beliefs and people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are experts on these subjects?</v>

1301
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually a very funny story and </v>

1302
01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:57.400
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remember,</v>

1303
01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.851
<v Speaker 3>in 2008 that New Indiana Jones movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out the Kingdom of the crystal </v>

1304
01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 3>skull and it's kind of a disaster of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1305
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

1306
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:06.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're making another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you believe it?</v>

1307
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 3>To redeem themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope they get worse.</v>

1308
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.160
<v Speaker 3>It can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't get worse.</v>

1309
01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 3>They just don't seem to make in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1310
01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great thing about the movie itself </v>

1311
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.891
<v Speaker 3>was the idea behind it was great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the execution was horrid.</v>

1312
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 3>It was basic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An ancient alien movie where,</v>

1313
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was chasing the crystal skull.</v>

1314
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 3>The Crystal Skull happened to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra terrestrial origin,</v>

1315
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1316
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history channel made a two hour </v>

1317
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 3>documentary about Indiana Jones and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feasibility behind,</v>

1318
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:47.861
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff that he chased down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was one segment about crystal </v>

1320
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:53.171
<v Speaker 3>skulls in which I appeared and talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the possibility whether to Chris </v>

1321
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Mitchell hedges skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1322
01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.100
<v Speaker 3>was in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or could in fact be an extraterrestrial </v>

1323
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 3>artifact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Mitchell hedges skull is what is</v>

1324
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 3>that the Mitchell had skull is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most perfect,</v>

1325
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.080
<v Speaker 3>the most perfect crystal m I t c h e l l</v>
<v Speaker 3>dash hedges h e d g e s Mitchell,</v>

1326
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.700
<v Speaker 3>hedges skull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that skull was found in beliefs by,</v>

1327
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>by Michel headrest daughter on her </v>
<v Speaker 3>birthday.</v>

1328
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this crystal clear crystal that was</v>

1329
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:36.340
<v Speaker 3>found in the shape of a humanoid head.</v>

1330
01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's massive.</v>

1331
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>It's really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the CRA,</v>

1332
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Mitchell hedges.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a countdown to revelation.</v>

1333
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 3>It's gloom and doom once again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1334
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:50.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dope looking skull.</v>

1335
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 3>And what did you say about this called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them have been disproved,</v>

1336
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:54.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this one hasn't.</v>

1337
01:10:54.611 --> 01:10:56.770
<v Speaker 3>And then there's no question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that,</v>

1338
01:10:56.771 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this one here,</v>

1339
01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.960
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so magnificent where the,</v>

1340
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:03.750
<v Speaker 3>you can actually detach the jawbone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1341
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:07.520
<v Speaker 3>from it any which means that the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from the same crystal,</v>

1342
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.760
<v Speaker 3>which means it had to be one big fricken</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock out of which this whole thing was,</v>

1343
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 3>was made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when was it found?</v>

1344
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Are they in the early 19 hundreds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

1345
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.790
<v Speaker 3>when Mitchell hedges or the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1346
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.340
<v Speaker 3>caretaker a after Mitchell had just died</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1347
01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:31.341
<v Speaker 3>and Anna took over or kept the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she and her,</v>

1348
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>this other dude who's name escapes me </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1349
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Dan in this arena or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1350
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:43.610
<v Speaker 3>They brought it in the 19 sixties to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>labs up in the bay area of Hewlett </v>

1351
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Packard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even in the day,</v>

1352
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only the best scientists worked at these</v>

1353
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:53.170
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1354
01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factories and labs.</v>

1355
01:11:55.470 --> 01:12:00.470
<v Speaker 3>And when the Hewlett Packard scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're done with all their research,</v>

1356
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 3>their conclusion was very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

1357
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 3>and I quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1358
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:13.791
<v Speaker 3>golf should not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a meaning that it was,</v>

1359
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:19.670
<v Speaker 3>they did not find any tool marks that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not find any polished or any </v>

1360
01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 3>evidence that this thing was polished or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

1361
01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And even more crazy is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>each crystal,</v>

1362
01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:30.120
<v Speaker 3>it grows in a particular access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in order to work crystal,</v>

1363
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:35.121
<v Speaker 3>you have to turn to crystal at high </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeds in that direction of the access.</v>

1364
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And according to the Hewlett Packard </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1365
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.980
<v Speaker 3>it was ground against its grain and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would shatter every crystal that you </v>

1366
01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 3>would do this too.</v>

1367
01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:47.960
<v Speaker 3>And the crystal Hydros I mean the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitchell,</v>

1368
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.710
<v Speaker 3>his skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1369
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.410
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still exists and it shouldn't.</v>

1370
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big mystery and yes,</v>

1371
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1372
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 3>some crystal skulls have been determined</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are,</v>

1373
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern day creations,</v>

1374
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:05.180
<v Speaker 3>but not to Mitchell address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1375
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 3>that could be another tool that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1376
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.750
<v Speaker 3>They used to have back in the day that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not thinking about that.</v>

1377
01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1378
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.710
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1379
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is how you got hooked up with </v>

1380
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>the history channel and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1381
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.630
<v Speaker 3>we like to do with crazy hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1382
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:20.790
<v Speaker 3>anything about Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1383
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And denied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I got a call and I was asking,</v>

1384
01:13:23.151 --> 01:13:24.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have I had,</v>

1385
01:13:24.541 --> 01:13:29.541
<v Speaker 3>I heard of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a book called chariots of the Gods </v>

1386
01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:29.541
<v Speaker 3>and Eric Fund,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danica.</v>

1387
01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1388
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:35.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we publish a magazine together in this </v>

1389
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.190
<v Speaker 3>and that and here we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1390
01:13:35.191 --> 01:13:37.020
<v Speaker 3>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an idea to,</v>

1391
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:42.021
<v Speaker 3>to shoot a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two hour documentary 40 years after </v>

1392
01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 3>chariots of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an argument</v>

1393
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 4>with a journalist when I first came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood wasn't really an argument.</v>

1394
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:49.330
<v Speaker 4>It was a talk at one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had these,</v>

1395
01:13:49.331 --> 01:13:50.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was fox,</v>

1396
01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:53.750
<v Speaker 4>I was on Fox and had a party for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sitcom I was on.</v>

1397
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 4>And a guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1398
01:13:56.011 --> 01:13:57.270
<v Speaker 4>can I ask you a couple of questions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

1399
01:13:57.271 --> 01:14:02.271
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he rattles off a bunch of questions </v>

1400
01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:02.271
<v Speaker 4>and one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in aliens?</v>

1401
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I said yeah.</v>

1402
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:05.610
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1403
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1404
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:07.920
<v Speaker 4>I saw this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chariots of the gods,</v>

1405
01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:11.390
<v Speaker 4>and it's a pretty incredible movie and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's,</v>

1406
01:14:11.391 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 4>it's more</v>

1407
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 3>than possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of stars out there.</v>

1408
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And he started going off on how chariots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the gods it was bullshit.</v>

1409
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.710
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1410
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:22.711
<v Speaker 3>it's been completely debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm pretty calm about that kind </v>

1411
01:14:22.711 --> 01:14:22.711
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1412
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.250
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how is it debunked?</v>

1413
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 3>And he had no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1414
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:27.780
<v Speaker 3>but yet you're so convinced that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunked.</v>

1415
01:14:27.781 --> 01:14:29.440
<v Speaker 3>But I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I read that had been debunked.</v>

1416
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't remember what you read,</v>

1417
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 3>but yet what did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you reach out to the gods?</v>

1418
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1419
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

1420
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:40.981
<v Speaker 3>I know it's all about aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And aliens came and made these </v>

1421
01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>structures and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1422
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.430
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty convinced.</v>

1423
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 3>But it was like a sensible man doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe such silly things.</v>

1424
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole attitude about aliens,</v>

1425
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:53.590
<v Speaker 3>about extra terrestrials or even about </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient civilizations.</v>

1426
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.920
<v Speaker 3>And these sensible man doesn't buy into </v>
<v Speaker 3>such nonsense.</v>

1427
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.530
<v Speaker 3>And you must have had to deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole fucking life.</v>

1428
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1429
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.880
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing where you just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>wacky with the hair and the jewelry and </v>

1430
01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I fucking bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going deep.</v>

1431
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy whole.</v>

1432
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm still the same guy from 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

1433
01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:11.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that,</v>

1434
01:15:11.411 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1435
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.200
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1436
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 3>especially the chariots of the gods </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that,</v>

1437
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you know from Danica has been debunked </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

1438
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:21.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1439
01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:25.210
<v Speaker 3>have you looked at this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the bottom line is that chariots</v>

1440
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:30.211
<v Speaker 3>of the gods had over 200 question marks </v>
<v Speaker 3>in it and even had a fricking question </v>

1441
01:15:30.211 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 3>wanting to fucking title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1442
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1443
01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 3>there was a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a idea.</v>

1444
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:42.660
<v Speaker 3>It's raising questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if those questions happen to be </v>

1445
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.300
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1446
01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:48.301
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so be it because a couple of them are </v>

1447
01:15:48.301 --> 01:15:48.301
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1448
01:15:48.301 --> 01:15:48.301
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a lot of Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1449
01:15:48.301 --> 01:15:49.420
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

1450
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this.</v>

1451
01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time you saw as </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist or,</v>

1452
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 3>or any author or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1453
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.740
<v Speaker 3>give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1454
01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years after they first publication </v>

1455
01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:01.820
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1456
01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on page,</v>

1457
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:07.561
<v Speaker 3>so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a mistake when chariots of the </v>

1458
01:16:07.561 --> 01:16:10.591
<v Speaker 3>gods came out as the 35 year addition to</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 year anniversary edition.</v>

1459
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Eric wrote a 16 page of preface to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>new edition.</v>

1460
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:23.660
<v Speaker 3>And in that he pointed out exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1461
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.800
<v Speaker 3>which mistakes he made in the 1968 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>1970 brooke on what page?</v>

1462
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.560
<v Speaker 3>And on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1463
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:33.190
<v Speaker 3>what happened here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1464
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:35.440
<v Speaker 3>one example is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

1465
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:41.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the iron pillar in New Delhi for a long </v>

1466
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.310
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.680
<v Speaker 3>we thought that this might be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is of extraterrestrial origin or at</v>

1468
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:50.200
<v Speaker 3>least that extra terrestrials taught </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice metallurgist.</v>

1469
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.400
<v Speaker 3>How to poor this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pillar of iron because up to that time</v>

1470
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 3>it didn't corrode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't rust.</v>

1471
01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had been around for many,</v>

1472
01:16:59.441 --> 01:17:01.630
<v Speaker 3>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know hundreds and hundreds of years.</v>

1473
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 3>And guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is rusting today.</v>

1474
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:09.750
<v Speaker 3>It's corroding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know what that piece of evidence </v>

1475
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1476
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.040
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the conclusion is that it in in </v>

1477
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>case a piece of evidence turns out to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong or false.</v>

1478
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:24.850
<v Speaker 3>If you eliminate that piece of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only makes the overall theory </v>

1479
01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>stronger because you eliminate false </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1480
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:34.900
<v Speaker 3>So to suggest that just because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a few mistakes and chairs of the </v>

1481
01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:38.120
<v Speaker 3>gods which Eric openly admitted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that the whole ancient</v>

1482
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.460
<v Speaker 3>alien theory all of a sudden becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

1483
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 3>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it more stronger.</v>

1484
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially on the show,</v>

1485
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:48.980
<v Speaker 3>ancient aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1486
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.220
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow is the premier of season three.</v>

1487
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm very excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

1488
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:57.220
<v Speaker 3>What's going well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you preview us?</v>

1489
01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell us to have some scoops?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any Nazi stuff?</v>

1490
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:05.820
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely stuff in there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has not been explored in the previous </v>

1491
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>History channel needs to combine Nazis,</v>

1492
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:13.511
<v Speaker 3>Ufo and ghost together and monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One are fucking smash them up show.</v>

1493
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1494
01:18:17.271 --> 01:18:22.271
<v Speaker 3>so I lost my train of thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>season of the history exactly his </v>

1495
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.000
<v Speaker 3>special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now in season three.</v>

1496
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:31.330
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how many university </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors have come forward and agreed </v>

1497
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:36.050
<v Speaker 3>to be on a show called ancient fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>aliens.</v>

1498
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that university professors,</v>

1499
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.340
<v Speaker 3>because as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1500
01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you're in TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to disclose what show you're </v>

1501
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:47.720
<v Speaker 3>calling from or what show you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be on.</v>

1502
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1503
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 3>put a question mark there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that university professors </v>

1504
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 3>are now coming forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for season three to appear on</v>

1505
01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:00.380
<v Speaker 3>that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that speaks volumes.</v>

1506
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's huge that,</v>

1507
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 3>that all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1508
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Eric von Daniken children's and I and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Martell and coppens,</v>

1509
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:11.140
<v Speaker 3>we're surrounded by people from mit </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about ancient aliens and what </v>

1510
01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.340
<v Speaker 3>exactly these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1511
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:15.160
<v Speaker 3>professors about what is their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1512
01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 3>their subjects of expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they,</v>

1513
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:17.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1514
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

1515
01:19:18.981 --> 01:19:23.981
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this episode that airs tomorrow and </v>

1516
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Aliens and the old West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a professor is not only do we </v>

1517
01:19:29.841 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 3>have elders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a native American elders who are talking</v>

1518
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 3>about the idea of star people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ancient American west,</v>

1519
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.940
<v Speaker 3>but also there are professors that we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten from universities and curators of</v>

1520
01:19:45.051 --> 01:19:50.051
<v Speaker 3>museums where they corroborate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories about the star people.</v>

1521
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And so which one do they do that well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>

1522
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.600
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1523
01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:00.760
<v Speaker 3>they have access to many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many recordings that were written down </v>

1524
01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 3>by a previous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1525
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 3>in the old west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things for the first time would be able </v>

1526
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.271
<v Speaker 3>to be recorded because in ancient native</v>
<v Speaker 3>American times their traditions were </v>

1527
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 3>brought from generation to generation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and words.</v>

1528
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Spoken words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1529
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.600
<v Speaker 3>And then when white men came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess unfortunately the,</v>

1530
01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:32.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was recorded all of a </v>

1531
01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:34.521
<v Speaker 3>sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have very old recordings </v>

1532
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.340
<v Speaker 3>talking about these star people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>came allegedly a long time ago.</v>

1533
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:43.550
<v Speaker 3>And so that is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge part of our theory that there are </v>

1534
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 3>entire cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1535
01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:52.731
<v Speaker 3>native Americans that talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kachinas descending from the sky in </v>

1536
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:59.540
<v Speaker 3>flying shields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were very adamant because of </v>

1537
01:20:59.540 --> 01:20:59.880
<v Speaker 3>course native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1538
01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 3>believe in the spiritual realm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no question,</v>

1539
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:08.250
<v Speaker 3>but they're also very adamant to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are two worlds,</v>

1540
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:13.430
<v Speaker 3>there is the spiritual realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there is also the physical </v>

1541
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:18.171
<v Speaker 3>realm and vet the star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were part of the physical realm.</v>

1542
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.850
<v Speaker 3>And here we are to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1543
01:21:20.851 --> 01:21:25.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know what they were talking </v>

1544
01:21:25.851 --> 01:21:25.851
<v Speaker 3>because they were just all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi there,</v>

1545
01:21:25.851 --> 01:21:25.851
<v Speaker 3>we're getting that pod.</v>

1546
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1547
01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course there is not one culture in </v>

1548
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the world that did not dabble in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mind altering drugs.</v>

1549
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

1550
01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a complete,</v>

1551
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:40.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's who we are as a people.</v>

1552
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:45.861
<v Speaker 3>There is no question about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time there were always </v>

1553
01:21:45.861 --> 01:21:50.241
<v Speaker 3>these different levels that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely no doubt in my mind </v>

1554
01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:55.490
<v Speaker 3>that the spiritual realm does exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also have a physical realm in </v>

1555
01:21:56.341 --> 01:22:01.341
<v Speaker 3>which our ancestors said that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in a physical form,</v>

1556
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:07.160
<v Speaker 3>so you think that there's probably some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an advanced life or some sort of</v>

1557
01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 3>a different life in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a nonmaterial form as well.</v>

1558
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some sort of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm,</v>

1559
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 3>100 percent chin or something like have </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1560
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 3>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of intelligent life,</v>

1561
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.610
<v Speaker 3>and then there's physical life is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know me,</v>

1562
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm the nuts and bolts alien guy.</v>

1563
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I would be a fool </v>

1564
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:33.560
<v Speaker 3>to deny or to even suggest that that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethereal realm does not exist because </v>

1565
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:40.790
<v Speaker 3>that would render our physical world </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely useless if that's all there </v>

1566
01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:42.660
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people are saying,</v>

1567
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1568
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 3>if you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it's going to happen is that,</v>

1569
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:50.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna basically just pull the </v>

1570
01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 3>plug from the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard drive and things like that.</v>

1571
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's usually the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they give,</v>

1572
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:58.970
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily true because if you keep </v>

1573
01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:04.191
<v Speaker 3>your computer in a very safe place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can leave it there unplugged for a </v>

1574
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.040
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you find a power source a million </v>

1575
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:11.680
<v Speaker 3>years down the road and you plug that </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer back in,</v>

1576
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.950
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything on that hard drive is still </v>

1577
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what if the hard drive is to soul?</v>

1578
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 3>And therefore once we die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our souls goes with us.</v>

1579
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:26.320
<v Speaker 3>That's who we are as an essence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes we will leave this body,</v>

1580
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time energy does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

1581
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.960
<v Speaker 3>It goes on in some form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to suggest that after this life,</v>

1582
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 3>it's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot process that.</v>

1583
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Do Kurtzweil and Ray Kurzweil's ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 3>downloading human consciousness into,</v>

1584
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 3>into intelligent computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea of your,</v>

1585
01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.520
<v Speaker 3>you will be able to duplicate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and live forever in some sort of cyber </v>

1586
01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.051
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fascinating and you know </v>

1587
01:23:58.051 --> 01:23:58.150
<v Speaker 3>what happens with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1588
01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 3>the spiritual version of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that takes place,</v>

1589
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:05.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe then that's where you live </v>

1590
01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:05.941
<v Speaker 3>inside that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside that saddle zombies.</v>

1591
01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1592
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you know,</v>

1593
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:12.901
<v Speaker 3>movies like the Matrix are so the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>one was so wonderful because those are </v>

1594
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:16.120
<v Speaker 3>all fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting ideas.</v>

1595
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.860
<v Speaker 3>But to me I'm a big subscriber to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reincarnation and uh,</v>

1596
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:24.460
<v Speaker 3>what I think because that because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy not being able to die,</v>

1597
01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:26.980
<v Speaker 3>and I think our soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our essence,</v>

1598
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.400
<v Speaker 3>his energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of this all encompassing force</v>

1599
01:24:30.401 --> 01:24:35.310
<v Speaker 3>that to me is the universe or God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

1600
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:39.400
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look for example,</v>

1601
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:44.401
<v Speaker 3>at the dialogue or a lot of Buddhists </v>
<v Speaker 3>who believe in reincarnation or Hindus </v>

1602
01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:49.171
<v Speaker 3>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always talk about how you will get </v>

1603
01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:53.161
<v Speaker 3>reincarnated here on planet earth as </v>
<v Speaker 3>another being or another animal or </v>

1604
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.280
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

1605
01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:59.281
<v Speaker 3>to me that's all very limited thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>because while I do subscribe to </v>

1606
01:24:59.281 --> 01:25:00.160
<v Speaker 3>reincarnation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no way,</v>

1607
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:04.000
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion that we would only </v>
<v Speaker 3>reincarnate here on earth.</v>

1608
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 3>We can reincarnate throughout the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1609
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 3>And that is why some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they come back to Earth,</v>

1610
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:15.571
<v Speaker 3>they're considered maybe old souls or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more intuitive to everything </v>

1611
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 3>that they might've been here before.</v>

1612
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:22.350
<v Speaker 3>So using this one universal bank of </v>
<v Speaker 3>souls for the entire universe and that </v>

1613
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody has to tip into it no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>

1614
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:26.820
<v Speaker 3>on planet fucking serious or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1615
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:27.310
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1616
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you all did for the same souls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

1617
01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 3>you could die here and then reemerge on </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

1618
01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:36.370
<v Speaker 3>go fuck yourself in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere and somehow somehow with a,</v>

1619
01:25:36.371 --> 01:25:41.371
<v Speaker 3>but somehow with the same quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinct or knowledge because there's </v>

1620
01:25:41.371 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 3>something that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the,</v>

1621
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 3>the eternal spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is,</v>

1622
01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:48.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we all consist of,</v>

1623
01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 3>of particles and elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every 60 days our entire bodies are,</v>

1624
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:56.470
<v Speaker 3>are completely recycled because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1625
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 3>we're completely changing tickets every </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years.</v>

1626
01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1627
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I did or it's the,</v>

1628
01:26:02.711 --> 01:26:06.840
<v Speaker 3>it's the complete resection of a body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is absolutely mind boggling.</v>

1629
01:26:06.841 --> 01:26:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty crazy.</v>

1630
01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It's seven years and we're being </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombarded by this cosmic dust.</v>

1631
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And that is what we consist of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of French philosopher </v>

1632
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 3>John Shiran in his book called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternal spirit.</v>

1633
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the internal internal particles </v>

1634
01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:24.670
<v Speaker 3>suggested that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1635
01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:28.870
<v Speaker 3>each time one of our particles in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>body travels through the universe,</v>

1636
01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:34.150
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it passes through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a stone or a or some type of a </v>

1637
01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 3>being or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it records everything.</v>

1638
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1639
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 3>each and every particle contains the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of the entire universe.</v>

1640
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's within us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1641
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.160
<v Speaker 3>it's the theory of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recording things by Rupert Sheldrake,</v>

1642
01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who he is.</v>

1643
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a,</v>

1644
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 3>some sort of theory that things </v>
<v Speaker 3>contained memory,</v>

1645
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 3>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tables,</v>

1646
01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:58.940
<v Speaker 3>chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1647
01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Because we're all made of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1648
01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:03.680
<v Speaker 3>And if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1649
01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 3>if these particles all record the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1650
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are all one.</v>

1651
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>See if you take a piece of skin and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it underneath the electron </v>

1652
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 3>microscope and you go deeper and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>and deeper and deeper,</v>

1653
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.750
<v Speaker 3>everything wobbles.</v>

1654
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Everything vibrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all exciting down there.</v>

1655
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1656
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.880
<v Speaker 3>that's just who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We consist of a vibration frequency.</v>

1657
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:33.040
<v Speaker 3>It's all harmonics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you take a piece of this Metal Cup </v>

1658
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.631
<v Speaker 3>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is considered to be inorganic or </v>

1659
01:27:37.631 --> 01:27:41.051
<v Speaker 3>dead material and you put a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>little piece under the same electron </v>

1660
01:27:41.051 --> 01:27:42.710
<v Speaker 3>microscope and you go deeper and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>and deeper.</v>

1661
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 3>At the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very core,</v>

1662
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.560
<v Speaker 3>it's the exact same thing and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge you for 100 bucks to tell me </v>

1663
01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.910
<v Speaker 3>which is which.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can tell.</v>

1664
01:27:53.911 --> 01:27:58.911
<v Speaker 3>I can tell the difference unless you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know exactly which means we all exist of</v>

1665
01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 3>the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't we all exist?</v>

1666
01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:07.141
<v Speaker 3>It actually has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean isn't like most of the universe </v>

1667
01:28:07.141 --> 01:28:07.230
<v Speaker 3>and nothing changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The universe's most.</v>

1668
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Mostly Adams and most adams are almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely nothing and end.</v>

1669
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 3>We consist of nothing too because while </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can touch ourselves and touch other </v>

1670
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:18.050
<v Speaker 3>people and the sensation of touch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this,</v>

1671
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 3>it's all complete its magnetism.</v>

1672
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should use that as a trial,</v>

1673
01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab some chicks ass.</v>

1674
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I've touched nothing was nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch.</v>

1675
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the stuff you're saying I agree</v>

1676
01:28:33.411 --> 01:28:38.240
<v Speaker 3>with and a lot of stuff they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edgar Casey for instance,</v>

1677
01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:39.220
<v Speaker 3>he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1678
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.440
<v Speaker 3>he believed in the Akashic records and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he,</v>

1679
01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:43.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can put them,</v>

1680
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:47.560
<v Speaker 3>he put his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put himself under hypnosis,</v>

1681
01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:48.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1682
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Self hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he was an under south </v>

1683
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:55.860
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became this brilliant all knowing </v>

1684
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.331
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had a third grade education and </v>

1685
01:28:58.331 --> 01:28:58.331
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he's all,</v>

1686
01:28:58.331 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 3>this information can be tapped into by </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

1687
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Just got to learn like meditation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it and that's why there's a big,</v>

1688
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:10.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation is huge and Yoga is huge </v>

1689
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:12.711
<v Speaker 3>because once you master meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually can tap into the Akashic </v>

1690
01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 3>records which holds the answers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1691
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Where you Edgar Casey Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you follow him at all?</v>

1692
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:25.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I really don't know much about </v>

1693
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.150
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1694
01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true that you see we only use </v>

1695
01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 3>about five percent of our entire brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1696
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that's been debunked.</v>

1697
01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if let's say,</v>

1698
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's 10 percent,</v>

1699
01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 3>don't even think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they've debunked it.</v>

1700
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that was back when people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorant as about the functions of </v>

1701
01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.961
<v Speaker 3>different areas of the brain and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've attributed different areas of </v>

1702
01:29:50.961 --> 01:29:53.631
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two different functions and I think the </v>

1703
01:29:53.631 --> 01:29:53.631
<v Speaker 3>more they understand about the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they realize that that's,</v>

1704
01:29:53.631 --> 01:29:55.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a misnomer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you driven down to four or five?</v>

1705
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:57.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still,</v>

1706
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:59.730
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1707
01:29:59.731 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

1708
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:04.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they even said like if you use more than</v>

1709
01:30:04.021 --> 01:30:09.021
<v Speaker 3>10 percent at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would just go into seizures and </v>

1710
01:30:09.021 --> 01:30:09.021
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1711
01:30:09.021 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all worship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all been disproven.</v>

1712
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1713
01:30:10.681 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I believe what you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well anyway,</v>

1714
01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea,</v>

1715
01:30:14.551 --> 01:30:19.551
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's operate under the assumption that </v>

1716
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:19.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1717
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:22.570
<v Speaker 3>we only use about eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to eight percent of our total brain</v>

1718
01:30:22.571 --> 01:30:25.770
<v Speaker 3>power is one guy suggested a </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosopher.</v>

1719
01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:30.771
<v Speaker 3>He said that the brain is the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>untamed beast in the universe.</v>

1720
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 3>And that is true because every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that we see each day,</v>

1721
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 3>every single thing that we hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that we say,</v>

1722
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:44.670
<v Speaker 3>our brains records it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is there,</v>

1723
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.300
<v Speaker 3>everything is there permanently for </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternity in our brains.</v>

1724
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.290
<v Speaker 3>The only problem is we can't access the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1725
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are great at,</v>

1726
01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>memorizing lines or memorizing texts or,</v>

1727
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.750
<v Speaker 3>or whatever or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have photographic memory,</v>

1728
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.310
<v Speaker 3>autism where they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1729
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1730
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

1731
01:31:07.651 --> 01:31:12.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally quote unquote functioning </v>

1732
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:12.651
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1733
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:12.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:12.651
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1735
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:12.651
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how,</v>

1736
01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:17.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have the code and code gift </v>

1737
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 3>to recall certain things and some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1738
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:20.270
<v Speaker 3>And that is where I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1739
01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:24.230
<v Speaker 3>the last frontier lies that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1740
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:29.240
<v Speaker 3>we could conceivably access way more of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our brain power and then you could move </v>

1741
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 3>proverbial mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 10 percent of the brain is </v>

1742
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 3>absolutely a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1744
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.430
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is actually a misinterpretation,</v>

1745
01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.460
<v Speaker 3>a misquote of Albert Einstein or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpretation of the work of Pierre </v>

1746
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Florins in the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1747
01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.220
<v Speaker 3>we use 100 percent of our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't mapped out.</v>

1748
01:31:47.221 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 3>They know what part of your brain works </v>
<v Speaker 3>for different areas that did not know at</v>

1749
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:53.490
<v Speaker 3>a certain point in time in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when people started,</v>

1750
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:58.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of chirping that and sending it </v>

1751
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.510
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>

1752
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.620
<v Speaker 3>So through the wonders of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just cleared that up.</v>

1753
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.230
<v Speaker 3>And this is why you never stop learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

1754
01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Every day you learn something new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1755
01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about all this Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit because,</v>

1756
01:32:08.261 --> 01:32:13.261
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's fascinating </v>

1757
01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:15.271
<v Speaker 3>about the ancient aliens show is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much the Nazis were into the occult and </v>

1758
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:18.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1759
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mahabharata and trying to recreate </v>

1760
01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.120
<v Speaker 3>things that were in ancient scriptures </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean being Indiana Jones thing.</v>

1761
01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 3>They kind of got into it with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1762
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:28.580
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1763
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:31.930
<v Speaker 3>what is it called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ark of the covenant and you know,</v>

1764
01:32:31.931 --> 01:32:35.440
<v Speaker 3>and that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's something to it.</v>

1765
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:37.930
<v Speaker 3>And the Nazis were obsessed with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1766
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but if they were just some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kooks,</v>

1767
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:43.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they clearly were in one way,</v>

1768
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 3>but there were also sell fucking vance </v>
<v Speaker 3>with rocketry.</v>

1769
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:51.361
<v Speaker 3>And with science and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean somebody companies came out of </v>

1770
01:32:51.361 --> 01:32:51.361
<v Speaker 3>Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1771
01:32:51.361 --> 01:32:54.140
<v Speaker 3>there's just Germany period for getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazi matter.</v>

1772
01:32:54.150 --> 01:32:55.170
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1773
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.750
<v Speaker 3>the Porsche started there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1774
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:58.300
<v Speaker 3>bmw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1775
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.320
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated engineers there were so </v>

1776
01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:03.320
<v Speaker 3>advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was there?</v>

1777
01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:07.551
<v Speaker 3>A big thing about Ufo is where was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole Nazi ufo connection because that </v>

1778
01:33:07.551 --> 01:33:10.040
<v Speaker 3>was one of the most fascinating ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>aliens to me.</v>

1779
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1780
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:14.550
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely something that</v>

1781
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 3>can be said about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1782
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea because many scholars say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1783
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler and the Nazis were never into the</v>

1784
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:27.541
<v Speaker 3>occult and that is simply untrue because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have found or they found a documents </v>

1785
01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.720
<v Speaker 3>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazis were immaculate.</v>

1786
01:33:31.721 --> 01:33:34.410
<v Speaker 3>The record keepers as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1787
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.420
<v Speaker 3>it says that these expeditions to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Pole to find openings at the North</v>

1788
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Pole and the South Pole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these expeditions truly did exist,</v>

1789
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:50.041
<v Speaker 3>that the real society and the Tulip </v>
<v Speaker 3>society really existed in things like </v>

1790
01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I personally find fascinating.</v>

1791
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.120
<v Speaker 3>But I gotta be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that to me it's not ancient </v>

1792
01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.011
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about Egos because that was 70 </v>

1793
01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:02.011
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1794
01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:04.370
<v Speaker 3>my ancient aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1795
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people consider a 70 year old </v>

1796
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:09.600
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient,</v>

1797
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:09.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1798
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.530
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my aliens happened thousands of years,</v>

1799
01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:16.540
<v Speaker 3>so you a Sumerian Mesopotamia and Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Greece and things like that,</v>

1800
01:34:17.681 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1801
01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.760
<v Speaker 3>you just never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would be foolish to not listen to</v>

1802
01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:30.850
<v Speaker 3>those stories or to look at these </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions because you just never know.</v>

1803
01:34:30.851 --> 01:34:35.851
<v Speaker 3>Just be open at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there like a bunch of faces and </v>

1804
01:34:35.851 --> 01:34:39.901
<v Speaker 3>paintings that have like old a drawing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an alien's on them and stuff like </v>

1805
01:34:39.901 --> 01:34:44.701
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And have those been disproven or have </v>

1806
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:44.701
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1807
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:44.701
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the.</v>

1808
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Because I've seen a few of them where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1809
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:46.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an alien.</v>

1810
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1811
01:34:46.501 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 3>that or it's just a guy that has his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head shaved and the artists sucks,</v>

1812
01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've done in any research on that </v>

1813
01:34:55.901 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1814
01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1815
01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote pieces of evidence we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1816
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1817
01:35:03.210 --> 01:35:04.150
<v Speaker 3>the deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1818
01:35:04.151 --> 01:35:07.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carvings that we find,</v>

1819
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but also the figurines and drawings on </v>
<v Speaker 3>vases,</v>

1820
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:16.451
<v Speaker 3>like what you were saying and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are compelling figurines and </v>

1821
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:22.901
<v Speaker 3>compelling drawings that compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern days are eerily similar to modern</v>

1822
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:30.611
<v Speaker 3>day astronauts suits and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times that the bunkers are </v>

1823
01:35:30.611 --> 01:35:30.611
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1824
01:35:30.611 --> 01:35:35.501
<v Speaker 3>so you're suggesting that the aliens </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here and why on earth would they </v>

1825
01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:40.901
<v Speaker 3>wear to same suits or why would they </v>
<v Speaker 3>need suits like our modern day </v>

1826
01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 3>astronauts because they were only a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more advanced us.</v>

1827
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1828
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:45.560
<v Speaker 3>But there were us in 100 years but we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would need suits.</v>

1829
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that.</v>

1830
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:51.520
<v Speaker 3>But that's the exact argument that if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't go to the moon without a suit,</v>

1831
01:35:51.921 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so why would aliens if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1832
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.850
<v Speaker 3>have oxygen based to people as we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1833
01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:03.010
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or people that need to breathe oxygen </v>

1834
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:03.010
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their life support.</v>

1835
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:07.300
<v Speaker 3>So to suggest that aliens are so vastly </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than us that I have a hard </v>

1836
01:36:07.851 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 3>time with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1837
01:36:08.601 --> 01:36:11.600
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that have suggested </v>
<v Speaker 3>that aliens are just these,</v>

1838
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:13.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1839
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.850
<v Speaker 3>blobs of slime and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1840
01:36:16.851 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 3>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1841
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:23.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would define nature because nature </v>

1842
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:27.341
<v Speaker 3>is very efficient and I think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>building blocks that are requirements </v>

1843
01:36:27.341 --> 01:36:31.400
<v Speaker 3>for life are pretty much a given </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the entire universe.</v>

1844
01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And so that if something happens here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think that aliens would exist,</v>

1846
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:40.790
<v Speaker 3>like in the Hollywood movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bit too much for me.</v>

1847
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1848
01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it's great entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do I think that that is how it is in</v>

1849
01:36:46.281 --> 01:36:47.960
<v Speaker 3>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

1850
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:50.630
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're all pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:52.390
<v Speaker 3>the same out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1852
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more advanced obviously,</v>

1853
01:36:54.171 --> 01:36:57.700
<v Speaker 3>but it looks nice because all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient uh,</v>

1854
01:36:57.710 --> 01:37:01.190
<v Speaker 3>carvings or descriptions and paintings </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have,</v>

1855
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:06.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you look at the ancient </v>

1856
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Hindu gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like us.</v>

1857
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just with blue skin for example,</v>

1858
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.090
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have four in India.</v>

1859
01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did have 20 arms,</v>

1860
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:18.430
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's definitely something to be said </v>

1861
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:19.340
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1862
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:25.270
<v Speaker 3>we think that we have depictions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show potential exit through restroom </v>

1863
01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:28.520
<v Speaker 3>visits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>visitors in the past.</v>

1864
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:33.660
<v Speaker 3>You must dominate some late night hippie</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy sitting around with,</v>

1865
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting around smoking weed with some </v>

1866
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:40.550
<v Speaker 3>chicks at a party and you drop some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this ancient alien knowledge dude,</v>

1867
01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 3>you must just knock it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking park.</v>

1868
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Or should I say have in the past or </v>
<v Speaker 3>should I say have the potential to.</v>

1869
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't say you use it for evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never evil,</v>

1870
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:56.170
<v Speaker 3>never evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in or what do you think </v>

1871
01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.880
<v Speaker 3>about the reptilian shape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shifting genre,</v>

1872
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 3>complete nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The David acres.</v>

1873
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:07.870
<v Speaker 3>So many nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got so many good points but a </v>

1874
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:12.041
<v Speaker 3>little things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you mentioned Shane shapeshifting </v>

1875
01:38:12.041 --> 01:38:13.540
<v Speaker 3>earlier this the possibility to turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>into clouds are trees.</v>

1876
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1877
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:19.290
<v Speaker 3>But I would not say that that's only </v>
<v Speaker 3>reserved for reptilians.</v>

1878
01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1879
01:38:19.681 --> 01:38:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I really think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1880
01:38:23.401 --> 01:38:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole argument with the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>reptilian thing.</v>

1881
01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:32.661
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really doesn't matter because what </v>

1882
01:38:32.661 --> 01:38:37.281
<v Speaker 3>this theory or this whole extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial question is about is whether</v>

1883
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 3>or not extraterrestrial life not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been here,</v>

1884
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 3>but also whether they're here right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what,</v>

1885
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:51.200
<v Speaker 3>whether their reptilian or if they look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like link the Loompa's he doesn't </v>

1886
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1887
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:57.350
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that having an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraterrestrial presence on planet </v>

1888
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:58.080
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only today,</v>

1889
01:38:58.081 --> 01:39:03.081
<v Speaker 3>but for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is sensational enough then to </v>

1890
01:39:03.081 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 3>suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1891
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:09.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming from planet so and so </v>

1892
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:11.400
<v Speaker 3>their space ships name is so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their commander's name was so and so.</v>

1893
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1894
01:39:12.391 --> 01:39:17.391
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all irrelevant garbage and that is why </v>

1895
01:39:17.391 --> 01:39:20.900
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream is not listening to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories because they're completely,</v>

1896
01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 3>it's complete buffoonery to suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1897
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:29.931
<v Speaker 3>what plant they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what their spaceships name was with the </v>

1898
01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:30.450
<v Speaker 3>propulsion system was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1899
01:39:30.451 --> 01:39:35.451
<v Speaker 3>it's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit extra terrestrials </v>

1900
01:39:35.451 --> 01:39:38.460
<v Speaker 3>we're an art here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all that should matter to you.</v>

1901
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:39.600
<v Speaker 3>That I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1902
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1903
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Do you um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe Robert Loser?</v>

1904
01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe his stories?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1905
01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and John Lear,</v>

1906
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:48.810
<v Speaker 3>John Lear's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the craziest theories ever,</v>

1907
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:53.811
<v Speaker 3>John Lear believes that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of humanoids on every planet in</v>

1908
01:39:55.591 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 3>the solar system and we've been to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the planets.</v>

1909
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a CPA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's Kooky,</v>

1910
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.910
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1911
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:07.340
<v Speaker 3>but Robert Lasar is not so cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Lazard is a,</v>

1912
01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I think he's probably full of shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>some things for sure.</v>

1913
01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:14.880
<v Speaker 3>But he's also a very intelligent guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>god damn,</v>

1914
01:40:14.881 --> 01:40:19.881
<v Speaker 3>he sounds confident as fuck when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you his depictions to pictures of </v>

1915
01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 3>what happened at area 51 and where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked.</v>

1916
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:22.770
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting,</v>

1917
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1918
01:40:24.421 --> 01:40:26.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's telling the truth,</v>

1919
01:40:26.311 --> 01:40:30.150
<v Speaker 3>but from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lied about his education.</v>

1920
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:32.040
<v Speaker 3>He lied about where he went to school </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've,</v>

1921
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:37.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've proven that he didn't get </v>

1922
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:37.090
<v Speaker 3>degrees where he said he got degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I dunno,</v>

1923
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1924
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:41.630
<v Speaker 3>could be more disinflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be more.</v>

1925
01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 3>He was really good friends with John </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

1926
01:40:43.081 --> 01:40:48.081
<v Speaker 3>They were buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not good because that John </v>

1927
01:40:48.081 --> 01:40:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Lear guys out to lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or John Lear says that the moon is a </v>

1928
01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 3>spaceship right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says that that's where your soul goes</v>

1929
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:55.300
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a song catcher.</v>

1930
01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.420
<v Speaker 3>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your soul goes to the moon.</v>

1931
01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.980
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me is nonsense.</v>

1932
01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:00.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just right there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1933
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never say never.</v>

1934
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 3>But that right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to lose the mainstream </v>

1935
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And listen,</v>

1936
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:11.700
<v Speaker 3>that Guy John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>

1937
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:14.260
<v Speaker 3>if anybody's a dis information guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Lear,</v>

1938
01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:19.290
<v Speaker 3>lear jets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys worth fucking $50 million dollars </v>

1939
01:41:19.290 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 3>is out there running around talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the moon,</v>

1940
01:41:19.391 --> 01:41:22.060
<v Speaker 3>catching souls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you die,</v>

1941
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you live in Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy,</v>

1942
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.680
<v Speaker 3>tell us about some episodes that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject or subjects that you guys are </v>

1943
01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.051
<v Speaker 3>going to cover that you didn't cover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first two things because he did the </v>

1944
01:41:32.051 --> 01:41:32.200
<v Speaker 3>cowboy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>

1945
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1946
01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the entire churches </v>

1947
01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:43.231
<v Speaker 3>and buildings that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are carved into the ground in </v>

1948
01:41:43.231 --> 01:41:47.041
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia at zoom and Baylor were </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently a a version or possibly the </v>

1949
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Ark of the covenant is still buried in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>town called act soon.</v>

1950
01:41:56.170 --> 01:42:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Now that's what got Graham Hancock into </v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole journey that he went on.</v>

1951
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:06.870
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't say mainstream reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was covering some political </v>

1952
01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:10.300
<v Speaker 3>unrest in Ethiopia and he started </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to some of the people that guard</v>

1953
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:13.450
<v Speaker 3>the temple that where they say the Ark </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the covenant is inside.</v>

1954
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.430
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1955
01:42:15.431 --> 01:42:20.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was very compelled by the evidence and </v>

1956
01:42:20.431 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 3>the history behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think about it?</v>

1957
01:42:20.670 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1958
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:26.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean every week they have a procession</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the town where they carry a </v>

1959
01:42:26.791 --> 01:42:29.650
<v Speaker 3>replica of the Ark around and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously a replica.</v>

1960
01:42:29.651 --> 01:42:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1961
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:36.910
<v Speaker 3>nobody has access to the arc except for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this family,</v>

1962
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:42.150
<v Speaker 3>for who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for generations have been guarding this </v>

1963
01:42:42.150 --> 01:42:45.270
<v Speaker 3>arc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's really fascinating is that </v>

1964
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.950
<v Speaker 3>each and every guardian of that arc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eventually go blind,</v>

1965
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.160
<v Speaker 3>which is really fascinating to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1966
01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:56.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're guarding this object that only </v>

1967
01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.831
<v Speaker 3>you are allowed to see if at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And each and every one of these guards </v>

1968
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:00.500
<v Speaker 3>has gone blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many,</v>

1969
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 3>how many you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1970
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:06.601
<v Speaker 3>we're talking at least 350 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Record it of people go on blind faith </v>

1971
01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 3>that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

1972
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 3>you could have that job.</v>

1973
01:43:09.010 --> 01:43:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may not have lava and you get this </v>

1974
01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:17.931
<v Speaker 3>arc of the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so awesome that it's willing </v>

1975
01:43:17.931 --> 01:43:18.340
<v Speaker 3>to make you go blind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is the exact question.</v>

1976
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:23.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so something is going on there unless </v>

1977
01:43:23.341 --> 01:43:23.341
<v Speaker 3>it's a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1978
01:43:23.341 --> 01:43:25.900
<v Speaker 3>and the stories have been made up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that man who,</v>

1979
01:43:25.901 --> 01:43:30.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told Graham Hancock about it had </v>

1980
01:43:30.901 --> 01:43:30.901
<v Speaker 3>cataracts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
01:43:30.901 --> 01:43:33.871
<v Speaker 3>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that led him to start </v>

1982
01:43:33.871 --> 01:43:36.241
<v Speaker 3>investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have heard that too many of the </v>

1983
01:43:36.241 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 3>people that have been in the care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing had been blocked.</v>

1984
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:42.030
<v Speaker 3>So what do they think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that it's radioactive and </v>

1985
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a way possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly.</v>

1986
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to what is it supposed to be?</v>

1987
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to the ancient astronauts </v>

1988
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:52.591
<v Speaker 3>theory that I represent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ark of the was nothing else but a </v>

1989
01:43:53.241 --> 01:43:58.241
<v Speaker 3>container in which an extra terrestrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>food dispensing device was stored in </v>

1990
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 3>food dispensing.</v>

1991
01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an extra terrestrial vending </v>

1992
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1993
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

1994
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to steal that from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that very much.</v>

1995
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 3>So the Ark of the covenant is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>but a fucking vending machine,</v>

1996
01:44:13.730 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that basically,</v>

1997
01:44:18.630 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>how did you come to that conclusion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look in the 19 seventies,</v>

1998
01:44:22.311 --> 01:44:27.311
<v Speaker 3>these two engineers then of Rodney Dale </v>
<v Speaker 3>and George says they wrote a book called</v>

1999
01:44:29.061 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 3>the man and machine and if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mana,</v>

2000
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Mana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning the,</v>

2001
01:44:32.651 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2002
01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 3>the breadth of that fell from heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2003
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:42.790
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ancient astronaut people and the </v>

2004
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:45.581
<v Speaker 3>mushroom people need to get together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with a unified theory of crazy </v>

2005
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.430
<v Speaker 3>because that's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monetize.</v>

2006
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2007
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 3>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is a,</v>

2008
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:52.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2009
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>in the Hebrew Zahar than there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

2010
01:44:56.691 --> 01:44:57.230
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2011
01:44:57.231 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Kabbalah,</v>

2012
01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 3>there a text in the Kabbalah called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zahar.</v>

2013
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:07.470
<v Speaker 3>And the so hard describes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ancient of days that the traveled </v>

2014
01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:13.540
<v Speaker 3>with a 40 year wanderings through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert at this ancient of days was with </v>

2015
01:45:14.091 --> 01:45:19.091
<v Speaker 3>them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the ancient of days has been </v>

2016
01:45:19.091 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 3>interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interpret as the Old Testament God.</v>

2017
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 3>And so these two engineers came along </v>
<v Speaker 3>and theoretic description of it and they</v>

2018
01:45:24.381 --> 01:45:25.100
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2019
01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:30.130
<v Speaker 3>this does not sound like a dad at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds like some type of a </v>

2020
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now mind you,</v>

2021
01:45:31.431 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 3>those guys were engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrical engineers,</v>

2022
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:37.910
<v Speaker 3>so they weren't some hobbyists or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like this.</v>

2023
01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 3>And one guy was also a linguist at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

2024
01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:43.920
<v Speaker 3>So they looked at all these translations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at all the,</v>

2025
01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different interpretations.</v>

2026
01:45:46.701 --> 01:45:51.701
<v Speaker 3>And they found that some of the earliest</v>
<v Speaker 3>translations of the ancient of days </v>

2027
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 3>wasn't in fact the ancient of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the transportable,</v>

2028
01:45:56.631 --> 01:46:01.631
<v Speaker 3>one of the tanks now that is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre that you have this thing that </v>

2029
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:07.751
<v Speaker 3>had to be disassembled and assembled </v>
<v Speaker 3>every week on different,</v>

2030
01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:08.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2031
01:46:08.741 --> 01:46:13.741
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a certain amount of time where </v>

2032
01:46:13.741 --> 01:46:17.351
<v Speaker 3>this machine or this object was taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart with different parts that were </v>

2033
01:46:17.351 --> 01:46:18.590
<v Speaker 3>connected with cubes.</v>

2034
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:23.770
<v Speaker 3>And there was a huge light source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just this magnificent thing </v>

2035
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:28.930
<v Speaker 3>that they determined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dispensed the Mana through big giant </v>

2036
01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 3>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also through tubes.</v>

2037
01:46:33.111 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 3>And things like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2038
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.220
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2039
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:41.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the reason why we have to the </v>

2040
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Sabbath today because on the sabbath the</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine had to be cleaned.</v>

2041
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:47.110
<v Speaker 3>So all those differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is wild stuff,</v>

2042
01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:53.110
<v Speaker 3>wild and crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it's very </v>

2043
01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:58.041
<v Speaker 3>compelling because the texts are exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that that on Friday and Saturday </v>

2044
01:46:58.041 --> 01:47:02.780
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get fed because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter and called dad had to be taken </v>

2045
01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:07.461
<v Speaker 3>apart and cleaned and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely meticulous and dangerous </v>

2046
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:09.440
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People died.</v>

2047
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:15.050
<v Speaker 3>People who did not know how to operate </v>
<v Speaker 3>or how to conduct themselves in the </v>

2048
01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:18.810
<v Speaker 3>presence of this transportable off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tanks.</v>

2049
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 3>They dropped to the floor dead and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would lose their fingernails.</v>

2050
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.290
<v Speaker 3>They would have a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you broke my crazy meter.</v>

2051
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Shit's broken night.</v>

2052
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.800
<v Speaker 3>It don't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2053
01:47:33.090 --> 01:47:36.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>

2054
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 3>My job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have done my job.</v>

2055
01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Try to throw your shit in my brain what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying about this machine and </v>

2056
01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:44.670
<v Speaker 3>then my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2057
01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:45.330
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brain's going,</v>

2058
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:50.540
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you asking me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's possible that there </v>

2059
01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 3>was like this ancient machine that </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed everybody?</v>

2060
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there a shortage of fully back then?</v>

2061
01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Could they just go get food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the food.</v>

2062
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:04.220
<v Speaker 3>They had awesome food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took an ice cream truck back in the </v>

2063
01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.371
<v Speaker 3>time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would freak the shit with an ice </v>

2064
01:48:08.161 --> 01:48:11.980
<v Speaker 3>cream cone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pushy that you would get initially,</v>

2065
01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:17.620
<v Speaker 3>there are ancient stories where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about magical glowing tablets that </v>

2066
01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 3>contained the universe.</v>

2067
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:22.450
<v Speaker 3>The universal knowledge was to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take that,</v>

2068
01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:24.960
<v Speaker 3>those were iphones back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2069
01:48:24.961 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2070
01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:27.780
<v Speaker 3>you have a magical tablet all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden.</v>

2071
01:48:27.781 --> 01:48:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is true.</v>

2072
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2073
01:48:30.091 --> 01:48:31.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2074
01:48:31.021 --> 01:48:36.021
<v Speaker 3>I believe that there's some shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings have discovered a long </v>

2075
01:48:36.021 --> 01:48:39.650
<v Speaker 3>fucking time ago and then rediscovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>it if human beings created the pyramids </v>

2076
01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:40.320
<v Speaker 3>and that is the general consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2077
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 3>and I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely human beings,</v>

2078
01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 3>but with the assistance of exit </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial technology,</v>

2079
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.580
<v Speaker 3>because that is what ancient texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2080
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 3>the all had taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kita are saying,</v>

2081
01:48:53.371 --> 01:48:56.850
<v Speaker 3>written by the Egyptian historian on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chrissy,</v>

2082
01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 3>that the pyramids were built by </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

2083
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:05.810
<v Speaker 3>which was a king and his people with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>assistance of the guardians of the sky.</v>

2084
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.580
<v Speaker 3>And in our interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2085
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.880
<v Speaker 3>the guardians of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're advanced flesh and blood could </v>

2086
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.540
<v Speaker 3>terrestrials who taught mankind how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use certain machinery Yo [inaudible] </v>

2087
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Zachariah such and believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids were never tunes that were </v>

2088
01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:28.551
<v Speaker 3>never built as soon as he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes that they were beacons for </v>

2089
01:49:28.551 --> 01:49:29.180
<v Speaker 3>the is.</v>

2090
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2091
01:49:30.121 --> 01:49:32.760
<v Speaker 3>that is definitely a possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally.</v>

2092
01:49:32.761 --> 01:49:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2093
01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:38.241
<v Speaker 3>I agree with the notion that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids were never tombs because,</v>

2094
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:43.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when the first time that the </v>

2095
01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:45.930
<v Speaker 3>pyramids were allegedly the seals were </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken,</v>

2096
01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:47.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2097
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:52.380
<v Speaker 3>no actual bodies were found in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's really fascinating is the </v>

2098
01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 3>fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
01:49:52.451 --> 01:49:57.451
<v Speaker 3>the pyramids defied every single other </v>
<v Speaker 3>co structure in Egypt because you walk </v>

2100
01:49:58.811 --> 01:50:03.811
<v Speaker 3>inside any tomb in Egypt and there the </v>
<v Speaker 3>walls are filled with hieroglyphics.</v>

2101
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really,</v>

2102
01:50:05.711 --> 01:50:10.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean it says exactly when it was built</v>
<v Speaker 3>by whom and how and when and what and </v>

2103
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:16.201
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go inside the pyramids and </v>

2104
01:50:16.201 --> 01:50:16.630
<v Speaker 3>they're completely anonymous except for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of cartoons.</v>

2105
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:21.830
<v Speaker 3>That debate is still out whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>these cartoon shows are in fact before </v>

2106
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:25.500
<v Speaker 3>juries were not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that that mystery has not yet been </v>

2107
01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:30.151
<v Speaker 3>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And despite what mainstream </v>

2108
01:50:30.151 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 3>archaeologists saying when they've dated</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Great Pyramid,</v>

2109
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 3>back to 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

2110
01:50:32.741 --> 01:50:34.330
<v Speaker 3>what have they used to data?</v>

2111
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:36.250
<v Speaker 3>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2112
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically,</v>

2113
01:50:37.421 --> 01:50:38.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that?</v>

2114
01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that you just asked that question</v>

2115
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:46.141
<v Speaker 3>because the great misunderstanding is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when there's a lot of people that </v>

2116
01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:49.000
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2117
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:52.720
<v Speaker 3>when they dated the Sphinx or when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>dated the pyramid and when they,</v>

2118
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:58.290
<v Speaker 3>and right there you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to take a step back because </v>

2119
01:50:58.290 --> 01:51:01.770
<v Speaker 3>nobody was actually able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't really date stone </v>

2120
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.350
<v Speaker 3>because the stone is an inorganic </v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

2121
01:51:06.150 --> 01:51:11.150
<v Speaker 3>If you carbon date something with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they call the c 14 or carbon 14 </v>

2122
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With dating,</v>

2123
01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:17.611
<v Speaker 3>you can only date something that's of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living material like bones or coal or </v>

2124
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:23.490
<v Speaker 3>textiles and things like that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they measure the half </v>

2125
01:51:23.490 --> 01:51:28.341
<v Speaker 3>life period of radioactive isotopes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's how you can accurately date,</v>

2126
01:51:30.641 --> 01:51:31.810
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2127
01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:32.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2128
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:37.890
<v Speaker 3>an old fire pit that has been found and </v>
<v Speaker 3>many times archeologists are dating a </v>

2129
01:51:37.890 --> 01:51:42.721
<v Speaker 3>firepit and then they come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular lady yields that the test </v>

2130
01:51:42.721 --> 01:51:44.770
<v Speaker 3>yields a particular date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2131
01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 3>500 BC and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2133
01:51:48.341 --> 01:51:53.341
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means that the site itself also </v>

2134
01:51:53.341 --> 01:51:53.650
<v Speaker 3>dates from 500 BC.</v>

2135
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:58.890
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion is a logical fallacy </v>

2136
01:51:58.890 --> 01:52:01.980
<v Speaker 3>because just because a firepit bates to </v>
<v Speaker 3>500 BC doesn't mean that was also built </v>

2137
01:52:05.381 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>in 500 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't date stones.</v>

2138
01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2139
01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:11.180
<v Speaker 3>So how do they do good Beckley Tepi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they say that?</v>

2140
01:52:11.181 --> 01:52:13.080
<v Speaker 3>That thing is 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old with,</v>

2141
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:18.140
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the fire pits and the bones that </v>

2142
01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:19.530
<v Speaker 3>were found in and around that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's still absolutely so,</v>

2143
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 3>which means that the stones themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>could date back even further.</v>

2144
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 3>It would be way newer APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2145
01:52:25.901 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look Weird.</v>

2146
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Are they using go Beckley Teppei though </v>
<v Speaker 3>for folks I don't know.</v>

2147
01:52:30.491 --> 01:52:35.491
<v Speaker 3>It's right now considered to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oldest structure ever discovered and </v>

2148
01:52:35.491 --> 01:52:38.440
<v Speaker 3>they're saying that it's 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years before Mesopotamian Sumir,</v>

2149
01:52:38.441 --> 01:52:41.680
<v Speaker 3>which was previously considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cradle of civilization,</v>

2150
01:52:41.681 --> 01:52:46.681
<v Speaker 3>the oldest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying that this was all </v>

2151
01:52:46.681 --> 01:52:46.681
<v Speaker 3>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can people were hunter gatherers,</v>

2152
01:52:46.681 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 3>but if that is what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how can you say that if it's just</v>

2153
01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.160
<v Speaker 3>like fire pit shit and bones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2154
01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is also that,</v>

2155
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:59.201
<v Speaker 3>you know on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the little Mediterranean island in </v>

2156
01:52:59.201 --> 01:52:59.201
<v Speaker 3>Malta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is right next to Sicily,</v>

2157
01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:04.600
<v Speaker 3>there are megalithic structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Megalithic meaning gigantic stones that </v>

2158
01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:04.900
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2159
01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:09.940
<v Speaker 3>250 500 metric tons heavy slabs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been transported from somewhere </v>

2160
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:13.820
<v Speaker 3>else put into place with incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>precision.</v>

2161
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.310
<v Speaker 3>And some of these have data to 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC when allegedly we were just,</v>

2162
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:22.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>munching on bananas and how do they date</v>

2163
01:53:22.101 --> 01:53:23.370
<v Speaker 3>these to 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC?</v>

2164
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:28.420
<v Speaker 3>What are they also again with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with bones and with having found fire </v>

2165
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:32.861
<v Speaker 3>pits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that does not mean that the stones </v>

2166
01:53:32.861 --> 01:53:32.861
<v Speaker 3>themselves have been placed there even </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

2167
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.740
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2168
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:40.010
<v Speaker 3>a method out there called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the thermo luminescent,</v>

2169
01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.530
<v Speaker 3>a dating method of stone where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2170
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:48.730
<v Speaker 3>you can conceivably date stone bites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit inaccurate because what </v>

2171
01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:52.121
<v Speaker 3>happens is if you Polish or cut a stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oxygen in the air,</v>

2172
01:53:53.691 --> 01:53:58.691
<v Speaker 3>there's a chemical reaction that takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>place with the surface of that stone and</v>

2173
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:02.820
<v Speaker 3>they can somehow somehow measure this </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been cut.</v>

2174
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2175
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:08.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very expensive way of testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2176
01:54:08.511 --> 01:54:11.300
<v Speaker 3>So in many universities unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have the money.</v>

2177
01:54:11.301 --> 01:54:16.301
<v Speaker 3>So they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third way is we're each time that </v>

2178
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:22.390
<v Speaker 3>you have an ancient stone overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were talking before about </v>

2179
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 3>erosion and if you have thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of rainfall,</v>

2180
01:54:25.791 --> 01:54:27.980
<v Speaker 3>what is left over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gave the answer,</v>

2181
01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:31.130
<v Speaker 3>you said rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly right.</v>

2182
01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:35.840
<v Speaker 3>So over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what forms over a rock is this thin film</v>

2183
01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:38.030
<v Speaker 3>that just built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a Patina.</v>

2184
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And the thicker this film or this Patina</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the older the stone.</v>

2185
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.840
<v Speaker 3>So people have in fact been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure the Patina and people have </v>

2186
01:54:50.421 --> 01:54:55.421
<v Speaker 3>determined that some of these cuts are </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of years old,</v>

2187
01:54:56.180 --> 01:55:01.180
<v Speaker 3>meaning they're not modern day creations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and right there it just boggles the mind</v>

2188
01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:05.150
<v Speaker 3>because it was certainly not cut with </v>
<v Speaker 3>blondes.</v>

2189
01:55:05.151 --> 01:55:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Tools are with chicken bones.</v>

2190
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:09.920
<v Speaker 3>As we were led to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had the opportunity right now,</v>

2191
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:14.921
<v Speaker 3>if the government came and they picked </v>
<v Speaker 3>you up and air force one and flew to </v>

2192
01:55:14.921 --> 01:55:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Washington and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to,</v>

2193
01:55:16.090 --> 01:55:17.630
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna offer you something I didn't</v>

2194
01:55:17.631 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 3>know you know a lot about the shit we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could use you.</v>

2195
01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 3>We're going to show you some shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you needed to help us.</v>

2196
01:55:22.881 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 3>But you can't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to quit your all your ancient</v>

2197
01:55:26.811 --> 01:55:29.300
<v Speaker 3>alien stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to quit your magazine.</v>

2198
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:31.550
<v Speaker 3>You got to work for the government and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell no one.</v>

2199
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.730
<v Speaker 3>And they monitor your fucking calls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you telling anybody you're dead,</v>

2200
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:39.970
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to take an area 51 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take you to Wright </v>

2201
01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 3>Patterson air force base to hang 18 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to show you all that shit.</v>

2202
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:46.901
<v Speaker 3>Would you be down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to show you the ancient </v>

2203
01:55:46.901 --> 01:55:46.901
<v Speaker 3>show</v>

2204
01:55:46.901 --> 01:55:46.901
<v Speaker 4>you everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the answer.</v>

2205
01:55:46.901 --> 01:55:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would do it right?</v>

2206
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd give up on civilization and be a </v>

2207
01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:53.900
<v Speaker 4>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2208
01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:53.900
<v Speaker 4>I might be to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might do it two.</v>

2209
01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:54.560
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2210
01:55:54.610 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 4>I quit comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quit comedy to learn about the aliens </v>

2211
01:55:59.610 --> 01:56:01.680
<v Speaker 4>because it helped me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2212
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 4>if you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you knew for a fact,</v>

2213
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:07.440
<v Speaker 4>would it help?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would we just sit around waiting for the</v>

2214
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:12.441
<v Speaker 4>ambulance to come?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when they didn't want you be </v>

2215
01:56:12.441 --> 01:56:12.441
<v Speaker 4>disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2216
01:56:12.441 --> 01:56:12.920
<v Speaker 4>if you do know that there are aliens out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and they're monitoring you,</v>

2217
01:56:12.930 --> 01:56:13.890
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2218
01:56:13.891 --> 01:56:15.190
<v Speaker 4>make something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2219
01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's something I would like to put on </v>

2220
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 4>the record.</v>

2221
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Hear that personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never seen a Ufo.</v>

2222
01:56:21.630 --> 01:56:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I have never been visited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never had any,</v>

2223
01:56:24.871 --> 01:56:25.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2224
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:28.440
<v Speaker 3>an abduction experience or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2225
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:31.590
<v Speaker 3>So because a lot of people asked me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I tell them,</v>

2226
01:56:31.591 --> 01:56:33.000
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I haven't been there like,</v>

2227
01:56:33.001 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 3>well then how do you subscribe to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas?</v>

2228
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:36.990
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2229
01:56:36.991 --> 01:56:39.690
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me this has really nothing to do with</v>

2230
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:44.310
<v Speaker 3>belief because belief always has this </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote religious connotation.</v>

2231
01:56:44.311 --> 01:56:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It means that if you believe something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have faith.</v>

2232
01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:50.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't have faith in aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't worship them.</v>

2233
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't quote unquote think of them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual or divine beings.</v>

2234
01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 3>There are people like us just more </v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced technologically speaking.</v>

2235
01:57:00.331 --> 01:57:05.331
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's more of an idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of knowing instead of believing I think </v>

2236
01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 3>about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2237
01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I quote unquote bullying.</v>

2238
01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:13.790
<v Speaker 4>So you think there's a broad spectrum of</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens out there?</v>

2239
01:57:13.791 --> 01:57:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some of them that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little more advanced than us.</v>

2240
01:57:16.431 --> 01:57:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Like they could visit us and maybe maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck us and gold.</v>

2241
01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's other ones that are like </v>

2242
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:26.861
<v Speaker 4>super advanced that are just showing up </v>
<v Speaker 4>as clouds and monitoring us and </v>

2243
01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 4>explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is</v>

2244
01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:33.620
<v Speaker 3>this a thing out there where this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carter chef is Soviet scientist in the </v>

2245
01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:36.100
<v Speaker 3>sixties and seventies actually came up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>

2246
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:41.340
<v Speaker 3>the classification of civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that there's basically three</v>

2247
01:57:41.341 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 3>types of civilizations out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>type one,</v>

2248
01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:45.090
<v Speaker 3>type two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>type three,</v>

2249
01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 3>type one civilization is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all about energy because in the</v>

2250
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 3>end that's all what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2251
01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:58.440
<v Speaker 3>he basically suggested that a type one </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization is capable of harnessing </v>

2252
01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.870
<v Speaker 3>the energy resources of their own home </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

2253
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:06.410
<v Speaker 3>A type two civilization is able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>harness the energy resources of their </v>

2254
01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 3>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a type three civilization is able to</v>

2255
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 3>harness the energy resources of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own galaxy.</v>

2256
01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Now we on this scale are were none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are type zero civilization on the </v>

2257
01:58:20.881 --> 01:58:23.910
<v Speaker 3>verge of becoming a type one </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

2258
01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:28.200
<v Speaker 3>So Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl Sagan actually suggested that we're</v>

2259
01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:33.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe a point seven or possibly now a </v>
<v Speaker 3>point eight and many of these </v>

2260
01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:39.380
<v Speaker 3>astronomers and astrophysicists are </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting that this transitionary </v>

2261
01:58:39.901 --> 01:58:44.901
<v Speaker 3>period from a type zero type one is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult and most dangerous one </v>

2262
01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:51.901
<v Speaker 3>because it does involve the splitting of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atom or monkeys altogether.</v>

2263
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 3>And monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2264
01:58:56.981 --> 01:59:00.730
<v Speaker 3>so I mean this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all fascinating stuff.</v>

2265
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Brian Asleep one thing I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask you about before when you studied,</v>

2266
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:12.780
<v Speaker 3>they found those little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rebuild and upper propellers on </v>

2267
01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:13.930
<v Speaker 3>them and they were like a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the pictures of those,</v>

2268
01:59:13.931 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 3>but it also looks like they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>modified the,</v>

2269
01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2270
01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:20.600
<v Speaker 3>the wings a little bit to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually fly a,</v>

2271
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:23.750
<v Speaker 3>what could it have been just easily like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a statue of a bird or,</v>

2272
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:24.790
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2273
01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:29.791
<v Speaker 3>Why is it all just they put routers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like they modified the </v>

2274
01:59:29.791 --> 01:59:34.050
<v Speaker 3>wings on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the actual statute is just like a </v>

2275
01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:34.050
<v Speaker 3>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:35.770
<v Speaker 3>that has to be curved in order for it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get flight,</v>

2277
01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:59:37.001 --> 01:59:39.220
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is that it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2279
01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.070
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2280
01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:43.720
<v Speaker 3>in the same collection of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>

2281
01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 3>the totems or robbed or found.</v>

2282
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:52.680
<v Speaker 3>They did find carvings or creations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds and they look totally different.</v>

2283
01:59:54.301 --> 01:59:59.301
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fish and crocodiles and what he was </v>

2284
01:59:59.301 --> 02:00:02.641
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier too about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wings being on the bottom and the </v>

2285
02:00:02.641 --> 02:00:05.161
<v Speaker 3>fuselage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that shit is like the rudder on </v>

2286
02:00:05.161 --> 02:00:08.221
<v Speaker 3>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no animal in the history of the </v>

2287
02:00:08.221 --> 02:00:08.221
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking thing.</v>

2288
02:00:08.221 --> 02:00:08.221
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2289
02:00:08.221 --> 02:00:12.721
<v Speaker 3>let me see some of those pictures you </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought him in because he brought in </v>

2290
02:00:12.721 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 3>some bad ass structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a your own collection.</v>

2291
02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stuff that I,</v>

2292
02:00:15.821 --> 02:00:19.000
<v Speaker 3>that I took a all around the world now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2293
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:24.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was saying earlier that </v>

2294
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:26.670
<v Speaker 3>obviously our ancestors did know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut stone and move objects and move </v>

2295
02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:31.231
<v Speaker 3>stone blocks and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's absolutely no question about </v>

2296
02:00:31.231 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did know how to do this,</v>

2297
02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:37.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to show you a physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossibility right now where I still </v>

2298
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:43.680
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show these pictures at each and every </v>

2299
02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 3>one of my lectures and I have yet anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come forward and tell me how this was</v>

2300
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:47.020
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2301
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:52.380
<v Speaker 3>And I've taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shown these pictures to engineers </v>

2302
02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:52.390
<v Speaker 3>to stone cutters and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they're like,</v>

2303
02:00:52.391 --> 02:00:54.490
<v Speaker 3>this can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look,</v>

2304
02:00:54.491 --> 02:00:59.491
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this structure right here,</v>

2305
02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:04.830
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's a type of a stone quarry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're blocks were cut out so you know,</v>

2306
02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:12.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no question that stone blocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>where were actually cut out of these </v>

2307
02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:15.910
<v Speaker 3>particular sections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2308
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2309
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:22.210
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this year is on the back entrance in</v>

2310
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Peru in an area called a orientate </v>
<v Speaker 3>tombow and uh,</v>

2311
02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:33.420
<v Speaker 3>what you have here is a two blocks that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were cut out of the side of the </v>

2312
02:01:34.811 --> 02:01:39.811
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one at the very top where if you look </v>

2313
02:01:39.811 --> 02:01:39.811
<v Speaker 3>closely at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2314
02:01:39.811 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>at this particular photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top one,</v>

2315
02:01:43.130 --> 02:01:47.120
<v Speaker 3>the top block or the top slab was </v>
<v Speaker 3>released by,</v>

2316
02:01:47.370 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having three cards on the left and the </v>

2317
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 3>right in the bottom.</v>

2318
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And then one blade that went down on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2319
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:57.770
<v Speaker 3>But now I want you to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom square of this particular,</v>

2320
02:01:58.090 --> 02:02:03.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slap it was cut out where you can see </v>

2321
02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 3>the four sites have been cut out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the back.</v>

2322
02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.740
<v Speaker 3>But there is no access point to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

2323
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the back.</v>

2324
02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look closely the bridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>that connects or that is between the top</v>

2325
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.690
<v Speaker 3>part or the top slab that was cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the bottom one,</v>

2326
02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 3>there is no access point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a solid piece.</v>

2327
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2328
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is that the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>one you could slide behind it and cut it</v>

2329
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 3>out because you could get at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2330
02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a bridge and as no way to </v>

2331
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:42.791
<v Speaker 3>get behind it and write it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as if somebody wants to have a good </v>

2332
02:02:42.791 --> 02:02:46.631
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual block that fit into the </v>

2333
02:02:46.631 --> 02:02:49.841
<v Speaker 3>bottom slot is sitting right next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we say.</v>

2334
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they just destroyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2335
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2336
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2337
02:02:52.571 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it and hear it is cut out.</v>

2338
02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2339
02:02:56.170 --> 02:03:00.590
<v Speaker 3>and that piece right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that blog has not a single millimeter of</v>

2340
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:05.591
<v Speaker 3>loss of material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like a carved around it or </v>

2341
02:03:05.591 --> 02:03:07.430
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a physical impossibility.</v>

2342
02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.620
<v Speaker 3>And the only way that somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2343
02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:16.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give an idea how this could have been </v>

2344
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:19.510
<v Speaker 3>been possible is you have a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is I really wish we had photos of </v>

2345
02:03:22.221 --> 02:03:23.960
<v Speaker 3>this that we could show people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2346
02:03:23.961 --> 02:03:24.650
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2347
02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:30.500
<v Speaker 3>W can they look up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to look up on the </v>

2348
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:30.500
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really fascinating.</v>

2349
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:34.000
<v Speaker 3>What is the name of this stone and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>could they look up online if they want </v>

2350
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
<v Speaker 3>to do with this yet broke?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people are looking at this at a</v>

2351
02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:35.680
<v Speaker 3>fraction?</v>

2352
02:03:37.050 --> 02:03:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I can send you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can send you the,</v>

2353
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:40.980
<v Speaker 3>what should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should they look for this?</v>

2354
02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:46.090
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is we untaped tombow o l l a n t a </v>

2355
02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:50.410
<v Speaker 3>y t a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b Oriente.</v>

2356
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Tom Is in Peru in Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a in the backs in the quarry of</v>

2357
02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:59.750
<v Speaker 3>that archaeological site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking incredible.</v>

2358
02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Now I got a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would the fuck is up with Peru?</v>

2359
02:04:03.561 --> 02:04:08.561
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much crazy shit in Peru with </v>

2360
02:04:08.561 --> 02:04:08.561
<v Speaker 3>the Nasco lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Machu Picchu,</v>

2361
02:04:08.561 --> 02:04:09.070
<v Speaker 3>those crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skulls with a,</v>

2362
02:04:09.071 --> 02:04:14.071
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deformed their skulls and make </v>

2363
02:04:14.071 --> 02:04:14.071
<v Speaker 3>themselves look like fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coneheads,</v>

2364
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 3>the Eland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gator craniums is a cone.</v>

2365
02:04:18.591 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Heads is definitely at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>below the same error.</v>

2366
02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Is it all combined?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no.</v>

2367
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2368
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:31.810
<v Speaker 3>one thing that's really great in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion is that the archeologists agree </v>

2369
02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:37.000
<v Speaker 3>that in Peru has the culture to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2370
02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:39.120
<v Speaker 3>the ancient culture of Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Incas,</v>

2371
02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:42.540
<v Speaker 3>and what's fascinating is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

2372
02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:47.541
<v Speaker 3>the archeologists agree that a pre inca </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization did in fact exist,</v>

2373
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:55.370
<v Speaker 3>but not a single archeologist agrees who</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell those pre inca people were.</v>

2374
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:03.620
<v Speaker 3>So this is where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your previous idea in theory definitely </v>

2375
02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:08.151
<v Speaker 3>comes into place or fits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a type of highly advanced</v>

2376
02:05:08.551 --> 02:05:13.551
<v Speaker 3>civilization back in the past that </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows even know what date and </v>

2377
02:05:13.551 --> 02:05:15.300
<v Speaker 3>some have suggested 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>

2378
02:05:15.301 --> 02:05:20.301
<v Speaker 3>years ago that that civilization might </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been wiped out because Puma Plinko </v>

2379
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:27.380
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is such an era of such a region or a </v>

2380
02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:29.970
<v Speaker 3>site that was 100 percent built by pre </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy,</v>

2381
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:35.030
<v Speaker 3>buy a pri inconsideration and still </v>
<v Speaker 3>today archeologists are fighting over </v>

2382
02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:38.010
<v Speaker 3>who these people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a buddy on the other day,</v>

2383
02:05:38.070 --> 02:05:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Thompson had been demonstrably feature </v>
<v Speaker 3>several times and I was saying that I </v>

2384
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:46.581
<v Speaker 3>had read something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was Graham Hancock </v>

2385
02:05:46.581 --> 02:05:48.981
<v Speaker 3>speculation about launch Picchu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That at one point in time it was at the </v>

2386
02:05:48.981 --> 02:05:50.130
<v Speaker 3>side of water isn't not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puma,</v>

2387
02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Puma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puma.</v>

2388
02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:51.520
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

2389
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.220
<v Speaker 3>wasn't much a pitcher.</v>

2390
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>In fact Puma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puma is translated.</v>

2391
02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:56.340
<v Speaker 3>It's but it's miles away from water </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2392
02:05:56.341 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2393
02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.640
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's right next to.</v>

2394
02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It's right next to Lake Titicaca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the highest navigable lake in </v>

2395
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:08.211
<v Speaker 3>the world at 12 and a half thousand feet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and still today,</v>

2396
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:10.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the train,</v>

2397
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:15.410
<v Speaker 3>the train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the train tracks that drive or to go </v>

2398
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:19.011
<v Speaker 3>through with the Bolivian highlands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the proven highlands are filled with </v>

2399
02:06:19.011 --> 02:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>muscles and with fish bones that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of years old </v>

2400
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:28.800
<v Speaker 3>proving that that area used to be under </v>
<v Speaker 3>seawater.</v>

2401
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.260
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>

2402
02:06:30.261 --> 02:06:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking,</v>

2403
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh water.</v>

2404
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:35.070
<v Speaker 3>We're talking seawater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

2405
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:38.730
<v Speaker 3>so people were punk who was built as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean port.</v>

2406
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is even something that </v>

2407
02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:44.820
<v Speaker 3>mainstream archaeologists have proposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

2408
02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 3>And how old is supposed to be then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that would mean it goes back to the</v>

2409
02:06:48.541 --> 02:06:49.410
<v Speaker 3>last ice age.</v>

2410
02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Socially we're at 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

2411
02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:58.880
<v Speaker 3>So all these Dasko lines and the top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazca lines isn't there like clear </v>

2412
02:07:00.271 --> 02:07:04.200
<v Speaker 3>evidence that area has been excavated by</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

2413
02:07:04.201 --> 02:07:09.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are entire mountain tops at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs are missing to have been as if with </v>

2414
02:07:09.661 --> 02:07:12.320
<v Speaker 3>a cheese knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know that it was higher.</v>

2415
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean what is the proof?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2416
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:17.670
<v Speaker 3>because you have a mountain ranges right</v>
<v Speaker 3>next door,</v>

2417
02:07:17.671 --> 02:07:22.671
<v Speaker 3>not even 100 yards away or 200 yards </v>
<v Speaker 3>away or a certain height of a certain </v>

2418
02:07:22.671 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 3>height and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2419
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:29.870
<v Speaker 3>and the other ones are completely like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like table top level is level </v>

2420
02:07:30.151 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 3>100 percent real affection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you play pool on it?</v>

2421
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really should go play some NASCAR,</v>

2422
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Nascar Pool right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the mainstream opinion of what </v>

2423
02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:42.610
<v Speaker 3>those lines are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ford's very clear.</v>

2424
02:07:42.611 --> 02:07:47.611
<v Speaker 3>You could only see them from the sky if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are just artwork their artwork for </v>

2425
02:07:47.611 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking who fucking exactly how big are </v>
<v Speaker 3>they?</v>

2426
02:07:50.070 --> 02:07:51.910
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>

2427
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Nazca is fascinating because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>world famous geoglyphs and mainly you </v>

2428
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:00.760
<v Speaker 3>people see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2429
02:08:00.761 --> 02:08:05.761
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the images of the spider and the monkey </v>

2430
02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:05.761
<v Speaker 3>astronaut astronaut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2431
02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 3>the astronaut who looks like eat with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big eyes,</v>

2432
02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.980
<v Speaker 3>one hand is pointing to the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other hand is pointing to is both </v>

2433
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:18.130
<v Speaker 3>suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of space with his dick.</v>

2434
02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

2435
02:08:19.721 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2436
02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:25.680
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time you have those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines that look like landing trips that </v>

2437
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.030
<v Speaker 3>look like landing strips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

2438
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:31.840
<v Speaker 3>we never suggest that that they actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>were landing strips because the argument</v>

2439
02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:36.841
<v Speaker 3>is completely ridiculous because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraterrestrials traveled millions and </v>

2440
02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:41.280
<v Speaker 3>billions of light years plan before they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can land is to get a build airstrips.</v>

2441
02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:42.520
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>

2442
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:46.270
<v Speaker 3>so for the debunkers to even say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nuts,</v>

2443
02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:47.680
<v Speaker 3>what do you think those lines are then?</v>

2444
02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Those long straight lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like,</v>

2445
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like an airport.</v>

2446
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely no doubt in that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like an airport.</v>

2447
02:08:56.891 --> 02:08:58.630
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2448
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.080
<v Speaker 3>look right now we've got a rover on Mars</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2449
02:09:02.081 --> 02:09:07.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving around and it's leaving behind </v>

2450
02:09:07.081 --> 02:09:09.320
<v Speaker 3>these tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're suggesting that at some point a</v>

2451
02:09:09.321 --> 02:09:14.321
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some type of an unmanned or possibly </v>

2452
02:09:14.321 --> 02:09:17.581
<v Speaker 3>even manned craft landed at Nassco for </v>
<v Speaker 3>to conduct a core drills and core </v>

2453
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 3>samples of the ground to determine </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's in that area because still today,</v>

2454
02:09:23.201 --> 02:09:25.510
<v Speaker 3>NASA is a bunch of drilled holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2455
02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are you.</v>

2456
02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:33.250
<v Speaker 3>And there's still mining going on today </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Nasa because it's very abundant in a </v>

2457
02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:39.150
<v Speaker 3>very precious raw materials on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to know about planet </v>

2458
02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:44.160
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to NASA and by conducting a </v>

2459
02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.730
<v Speaker 3>few days of research you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the cliff notes of planet </v>

2460
02:09:47.730 --> 02:09:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Earth essentially.</v>

2461
02:09:47.730 --> 02:09:52.500
<v Speaker 3>And so imagine if you had a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>natives there and all of a sudden this </v>

2462
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 3>thing lands that conducts a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>research there,</v>

2463
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid they run away.</v>

2464
02:09:57.070 --> 02:09:58.040
<v Speaker 3>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2465
02:09:58.130 --> 02:10:03.130
<v Speaker 3>this craft leaves again and it leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has left behind some tracks in the </v>

2466
02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:08.041
<v Speaker 3>sand or on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they come back out and they </v>

2467
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:08.041
<v Speaker 3>look at this stuff and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2468
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:12.961
<v Speaker 3>what just happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we were just visited by God </v>

2469
02:10:12.961 --> 02:10:15.940
<v Speaker 3>doesn't create these funerary objects </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are 1000,</v>

2470
02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:20.941
<v Speaker 3>500 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like planes that are from </v>

2471
02:10:20.941 --> 02:10:20.941
<v Speaker 3>central and South America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it make more sense that they had</v>

2472
02:10:20.941 --> 02:10:23.320
<v Speaker 3>planes that someone had planes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

2473
02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2474
02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:29.130
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is the suggestion that the </v>

2475
02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:31.730
<v Speaker 3>runways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what this whole multi Nazca </v>

2476
02:10:31.730 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 3>lines thing maybe it really isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport.</v>

2477
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always,</v>

2478
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm always one to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never say never.</v>

2479
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:41.630
<v Speaker 3>So I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2480
02:10:41.631 --> 02:10:44.030
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flush and loved ones at that.</v>

2481
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:45.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is that,</v>

2482
02:10:45.431 --> 02:10:48.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is that at Nassco,</v>

2483
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 3>what's really odd is that we have done </v>
<v Speaker 3>some research there were we found,</v>

2484
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher levels of arsenic in areas where </v>

2485
02:10:57.950 --> 02:11:00.461
<v Speaker 3>there shouldn't be any arsenic and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre magnetic fields there where you </v>

2486
02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:05.501
<v Speaker 3>can put down your compass and it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 3>on spinning and things like that at the </v>

2487
02:11:05.501 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 3>beginning and the end of this runway </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking like strips.</v>

2488
02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so something definitely happened </v>

2489
02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:18.071
<v Speaker 3>there because the whole idea that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>very easy to build these things is </v>

2490
02:11:18.071 --> 02:11:19.760
<v Speaker 3>nonsense because people have suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2491
02:11:19.770 --> 02:11:22.820
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>scratch off the surface of the,</v>

2492
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>off the off the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you expose the lighter and </v>

2493
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:30.200
<v Speaker 3>darker underground with the pebbles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

2494
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.800
<v Speaker 3>We've tried that and people have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>

2495
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:37.070
<v Speaker 3>So many things in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that,</v>

2496
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.890
<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With Machu Picchu and the skulls,</v>

2497
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 3>those people that were forming their </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads,</v>

2498
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:45.170
<v Speaker 3>what is the explanation for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made their heads or an alien heads.</v>

2499
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:47.430
<v Speaker 3>They flatten them out and them out </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain.</v>

2500
02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Well and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the crazy thing that </v>

2501
02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:54.380
<v Speaker 3>archeology even has an answer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say that the reason why,</v>

2502
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:59.381
<v Speaker 3>and this was achieved by binding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infant's head upon birth with the wooden</v>

2503
02:12:00.171 --> 02:12:03.430
<v Speaker 3>boards so that the brains or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2504
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:05.510
<v Speaker 3>the skull brain chambers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would,</v>

2505
02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:08.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow into this elongated fashion.</v>

2506
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:11.810
<v Speaker 3>And the archeologists are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2507
02:12:11.811 --> 02:12:16.811
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they did this because they </v>

2508
02:12:16.811 --> 02:12:18.671
<v Speaker 3>were mimicking or worshiping their gods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they pat each other on the </v>

2509
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and then they go home and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>case solved mystery done.</v>

2510
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:25.460
<v Speaker 3>We're out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

2511
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:28.400
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly where I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2512
02:12:28.401 --> 02:12:32.150
<v Speaker 3>this isn't that where the mystery is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>solved because the question is,</v>

2513
02:12:32.151 --> 02:12:33.230
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just said,</v>

2514
02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.700
<v Speaker 3>but this was done in order to worship </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gods.</v>

2515
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my question is,</v>

2516
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:44.770
<v Speaker 3>who were these gods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the question that the </v>

2517
02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:47.081
<v Speaker 3>archeologists are not answering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there any images that they have of </v>

2518
02:12:47.081 --> 02:12:47.570
<v Speaker 3>these gods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

2519
02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all over ancient Egypt,</v>

2520
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:55.991
<v Speaker 3>which by the way did the Sgo deformation</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon also happened in ancient </v>

2521
02:12:55.991 --> 02:12:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened in Germany.</v>

2522
02:12:57.441 --> 02:12:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It happened in Russia all around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2523
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Do we have these elongated skulls that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are obviously human in origin,</v>

2524
02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 3>but they all have all these elongated </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>

2525
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:12.251
<v Speaker 3>And then there are some scholars that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if they're really human in </v>

2526
02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:13.490
<v Speaker 3>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2527
02:13:13.491 --> 02:13:15.870
<v Speaker 3>who knows that star child thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about that,</v>

2528
02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:20.880
<v Speaker 3>is that a horseshit that for example?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's definitely something worth </v>

2529
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:21.080
<v Speaker 3>looking into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2530
02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:24.200
<v Speaker 3>There's no question in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to return to the Eland,</v>

2531
02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:27.220
<v Speaker 3>you don't know about star child now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Star child skull,</v>

2532
02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:30.400
<v Speaker 3>the they found it's really freaky </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>

2533
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>They've determined that it's human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it</v>

2534
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:36.180
<v Speaker 4>might be human plus something else like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mitochondrial Dna,</v>

2535
02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:41.181
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was determined that the </v>

2536
02:13:41.181 --> 02:13:41.181
<v Speaker 4>mother was human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what father was.</v>

2537
02:13:41.181 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just reading it online.</v>

2538
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 4>It could easily just be some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>birth defects.</v>

2539
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:47.760
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to be debated,</v>

2540
02:13:47.761 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 4>but the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a fascinating story that</v>

2541
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:55.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>merits further investigation out of all </v>

2542
02:13:55.450 --> 02:13:55.950
<v Speaker 4>these sites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Replaces,</v>

2543
02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.410
<v Speaker 4>haven't you been to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to most of them.</v>

2544
02:13:58.411 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Eighty percent of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety percent of them like.</v>

2545
02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:06.460
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know there's definitely been </v>

2546
02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:09.121
<v Speaker 4>about to 75 percent of the stuff because</v>
<v Speaker 4>see that's the most mind blowing and </v>

2547
02:14:10.801 --> 02:14:11.970
<v Speaker 4>putting the Puente club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2548
02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean look for sheer size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely the great pyramids on </v>

2549
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.560
<v Speaker 4>the Giza plateau because have you been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must go.</v>

2550
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:20.720
<v Speaker 4>I met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been you.</v>

2551
02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only been to you need,</v>

2552
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:24.340
<v Speaker 4>so that's the only place I.</v>

2553
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 4>that's also crazy thing with the shadow </v>
<v Speaker 4>play in all this.</v>

2554
02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2555
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000
<v Speaker 4>when you stand in front of that pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're breathless that you can't </v>

2556
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.290
<v Speaker 4>breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so incredible.</v>

2557
02:14:36.291 --> 02:14:41.291
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy about him is that you never </v>
<v Speaker 4>see the pyramids and the pictures that </v>

2558
02:14:41.291 --> 02:14:43.090
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never see that there's like a ghetto</v>

2559
02:14:43.091 --> 02:14:45.840
<v Speaker 4>and Egypt and get on all around it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2560
02:14:45.841 --> 02:14:50.841
<v Speaker 4>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one side of the pyramid where </v>

2561
02:14:50.841 --> 02:14:52.881
<v Speaker 4>it's all open desert and then right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there you're in a ghetto and the cool </v>

2562
02:14:52.881 --> 02:14:55.230
<v Speaker 4>thing is when you drive around this </v>
<v Speaker 4>gallery owner and garbage,</v>

2563
02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.260
<v Speaker 4>but the pyramid is always visible </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever you go.</v>

2564
02:14:58.261 --> 02:15:01.680
<v Speaker 4>So you've got this ancient monument and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you place.</v>

2565
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2566
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:09.750
<v Speaker 4>Drive bys cheap goat head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's cool about your job?</v>

<v Speaker 4>there was ever a chick that was like a </v>

2568
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.650
<v Speaker 4>little bit out of your league,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could always saying it,</v>

2571
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.070

<v Speaker 4>if I was a chicken,</v>

2572
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:29.090

<v Speaker 4>and we get traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2576
02:15:34.050 --> 02:15:38.280
<v Speaker 4>a man with that kind of experienced sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a nerd,</v>

2577
02:15:38.281 --> 02:15:43.281
<v Speaker 4>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy hair and all of his </v>

2578
02:15:43.281 --> 02:15:43.281
<v Speaker 4>jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do want to go to Easter island.</v>

2579
02:15:43.281 --> 02:15:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Who the Puma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Nazi symbol built into it.</v>

2580
02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Got One part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he has chicks laying it out.</v>

2581
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:51.840
<v Speaker 4>You probably have chicks laying it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>on Easter island.</v>

2582
02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.570
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and along the input,</v>

2583
02:15:54.610 --> 02:15:59.610
<v Speaker 4>put a swastika was a swastika and put </v>
<v Speaker 4>them up there because all around the </v>

2584
02:16:00.511 --> 02:16:02.550
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact the swastika is,</v>

2585
02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.760
<v Speaker 4>has its origin in ancient India and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hindu and good fortune.</v>

2586
02:16:08.581 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2587
02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:13.740
<v Speaker 4>So the first telling people that now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2588
02:16:13.741 --> 02:16:16.410
<v Speaker 4>they reversed the reverse that </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>

2589
02:16:16.411 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2590
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.590
<v Speaker 4>but the bottom line is they're ruined </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2591
02:16:19.591 --> 02:16:24.591
<v Speaker 4>And the little mustache,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jordan tried to bring back that </v>

2592
02:16:24.591 --> 02:16:28.201
<v Speaker 4>a little monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of an ego that </v>

2593
02:16:28.201 --> 02:16:28.201
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they reversed it to say,</v>

2594
02:16:28.201 --> 02:16:29.440
<v Speaker 4>sign of death instead of sign of good </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortune or</v>

2595
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:35.460
<v Speaker 3>bad fortune gang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just stole it and it was also used </v>

2596
02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 3>in ancient Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2597
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did reverse it.</v>

2598
02:16:39.431 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2599
02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:42.160
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Symbolism is fascinating,</v>

2600
02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:45.310
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to me about the Egyptian language</v>

2601
02:16:45.311 --> 02:16:50.311
<v Speaker 3>that it was all symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead of with us with letters and </v>

2602
02:16:50.311 --> 02:16:54.101
<v Speaker 3>each letter having a sound that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have is like symbols and he said </v>

2603
02:16:54.101 --> 02:16:56.530
<v Speaker 3>that apparently just absorbing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>language isn't interpreting and just has</v>

2604
02:16:56.531 --> 02:16:59.080
<v Speaker 3>a completely different experience in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human mind.</v>

2605
02:16:59.370 --> 02:17:03.310
<v Speaker 3>You know these all these symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have symbols that we re register like</v>

2606
02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:05.620
<v Speaker 3>this is a McDonald's symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is citgo,</v>

2607
02:17:05.621 --> 02:17:10.621
<v Speaker 3>this but their language consistent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things and that is a completely </v>

2608
02:17:10.621 --> 02:17:14.350
<v Speaker 3>different experience than reading our </v>
<v Speaker 3>language and the ancient,</v>

2609
02:17:14.351 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 3>the incas had not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had string.</v>

2610
02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 3>That was their language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their.</v>

2611
02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:21.190
<v Speaker 3>That was their written language number.</v>

2612
02:17:21.250 --> 02:17:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Why they got jacked by the Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Spanish came over and go,</v>

2613
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo writing string with a shop to giving </v>

2614
02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:32.350
<v Speaker 3>us a gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get the gold for that motherfucker</v>

2615
02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:37.380
<v Speaker 3>on the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is rather because what wants the </v>

2616
02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:38.860
<v Speaker 3>gold ran out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started fucking slicing,</v>

2617
02:17:39.550 --> 02:17:44.550
<v Speaker 3>realizing that they weren't God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore till they thought people on </v>

2618
02:17:44.550 --> 02:17:44.830
<v Speaker 3>horses were gods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2619
02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:48.720
<v Speaker 3>there's actually a little bit more to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that story and that is that get out.</v>

2620
02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:54.660
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was toward the end that many Asian </v>

2621
02:17:56.921 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 3>cultures based their whole calendar on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the return of the gods.</v>

2622
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:03.250
<v Speaker 3>And it just so happened that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2623
02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:08.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both Cortez and Pittsboro happened to </v>

2624
02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.460
<v Speaker 3>arrive on the shores in the same year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking lucked out is it?</v>

2625
02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was complete chance and need the beard </v>

2626
02:18:17.931 --> 02:18:22.931
<v Speaker 3>at the serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The plume serpent doesn't that same </v>

2627
02:18:22.931 --> 02:18:24.300
<v Speaker 3>thing mean a bearded man isn't there </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2628
02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:29.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the translation of Queso and Kukula con </v>

2629
02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:33.690
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so similar to a man with a beard </v>

2630
02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2631
02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:38.470
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aztecs were so baffled by these people </v>

2632
02:18:38.470 --> 02:18:38.620
<v Speaker 3>really are men with beards.</v>

2633
02:18:38.670 --> 02:18:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2634
02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2635
02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it,</v>

2636
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:47.641
<v Speaker 3>but to me that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very elitist in,</v>

2637
02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:52.200
<v Speaker 3>in a certain way because even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2638
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:55.030
<v Speaker 3>those theories have been proposed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2639
02:18:55.031 --> 02:19:00.031
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this redheaded guy appeared with a red </v>

2640
02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:02.170
<v Speaker 3>beard and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's why he was worshiped.</v>

2641
02:19:02.171 --> 02:19:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2642
02:19:02.521 --> 02:19:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that people are or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2643
02:19:05.051 --> 02:19:07.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those coaches back then were so shallow.</v>

2644
02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:11.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it has more to do that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>quits bottler coopered con character.</v>

2645
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:17.490
<v Speaker 3>If he was a redhead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy that he flew around in this flute </v>

2646
02:19:17.490 --> 02:19:22.380
<v Speaker 3>flying or plumed or winged serpent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this winged serpent,</v>

2647
02:19:22.391 --> 02:19:27.160
<v Speaker 3>we all know that snakes do not fly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need enough mushrooms.</v>

2648
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:27.830
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2649
02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.920
<v Speaker 3>I can talk to you and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that you can't </v>

2650
02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:36.080
<v Speaker 3>attribute everything that a person sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>to mushrooms,</v>

2651
02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:38.690
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've done enough mushrooms.</v>

2652
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.040
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2653
02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2654
02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I have to say something about yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2655
02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:48.041
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is that our collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>through our collective consciousness </v>

2656
02:19:48.041 --> 02:19:49.400
<v Speaker 3>today is way bigger than the collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

2657
02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>

2658
02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because today if yes,</v>

2659
02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing is that you know today,</v>

2660
02:19:57.650 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 3>if we see if we see a spaceship or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ufo,</v>

2661
02:20:01.671 --> 02:20:05.240
<v Speaker 3>we can immediately recognize it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship or a Ufo.</v>

2662
02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't know what that was,</v>

2663
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.630
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter how many mushrooms you</v>
<v Speaker 3>took,</v>

2664
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:16.990
<v Speaker 3>you still have to describe it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was a spark of </v>

2665
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 3>inspiration or a spark of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2666
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:22.280
<v Speaker 3>that motivated or inspired all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

2667
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:27.550
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do we not know that what these </v>

2668
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:29.981
<v Speaker 3>stories are is people's memory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else who had seen people who </v>

2669
02:20:31.641 --> 02:20:36.220
<v Speaker 3>were flying around and it was thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years ago over time,</v>

2670
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:37.160
<v Speaker 3>but that's the story.</v>

2671
02:20:37.450 --> 02:20:39.000
<v Speaker 3>More and more diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2672
02:20:39.310 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to heal and they and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely did.</v>

2673
02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.230
<v Speaker 3>They did get diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole.</v>

2674
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:47.240
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2675
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:49.150
<v Speaker 3>that's why we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2676
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Christianity today and Islam and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those different things.</v>

2677
02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I believe you believe these depiction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>

2678
02:20:57.831 --> 02:21:02.831
<v Speaker 3>that we were engineered from a lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates by some aliens to mine for </v>

2679
02:21:02.831 --> 02:21:06.740
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I subscribe to the sort of first,</v>

2680
02:21:06.741 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a part of that statement,</v>

2681
02:21:08.841 --> 02:21:09.460
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2682
02:21:09.490 --> 02:21:14.490
<v Speaker 3>that we came about through a direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>targeted mutation of our genes and that </v>

2683
02:21:15.650 --> 02:21:17.420
<v Speaker 3>that will be the ultimate proof by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2684
02:21:17.421 --> 02:21:22.421
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate proof of visitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to be in a crash spaceship or a </v>

2685
02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:25.040
<v Speaker 3>finding a ray gun or something silly </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2686
02:21:25.041 --> 02:21:30.041
<v Speaker 3>but it'll be an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be found in our own genes that </v>

2687
02:21:30.041 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 3>something happened in the past that did </v>
<v Speaker 3>not come by chance,</v>

2688
02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:36.730
<v Speaker 3>but haven't they already mapped out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human genome is not how they understand </v>

2689
02:21:36.730 --> 02:21:40.331
<v Speaker 3>like the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people mostly related to </v>

2690
02:21:40.331 --> 02:21:42.020
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals and they've definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out all these things.</v>

2691
02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2692
02:21:43.401 --> 02:21:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many conclusions have been drawn,</v>

2693
02:21:46.971 --> 02:21:49.820
<v Speaker 3>but there's still some mystery in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human genome.</v>

2694
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2695
02:21:52.101 --> 02:21:52.640
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2696
02:21:52.641 --> 02:21:57.641
<v Speaker 3>95 percent of our human genome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our DNA makeup allegedly is junk.</v>

2697
02:21:58.650 --> 02:22:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely disagree with that.</v>

2698
02:22:00.801 --> 02:22:05.801
<v Speaker 3>Just because we can't decipher those 95 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent yet doesn't mean that that 95 </v>

2699
02:22:08.421 --> 02:22:13.421
<v Speaker 3>percent truly is garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that in our lifetime and things </v>

2700
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:17.260
<v Speaker 3>are going to change quickly though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>

2701
02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.580
<v Speaker 3>we were not create a slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2702
02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:24.110
<v Speaker 3>absolutely don't believe that's again </v>
<v Speaker 3>and glue nonsense.</v>

2703
02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:29.140
<v Speaker 3>So they came and they just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked with people and created what we </v>

2704
02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:31.110
<v Speaker 3>will do 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now on another planet.</v>

2705
02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:32.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2706
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:34.500
<v Speaker 3>if we want to experiment and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2707
02:22:34.501 --> 02:22:38.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good in the end always outweighs the bad</v>

2708
02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:42.060
<v Speaker 3>talk to the Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got checked well,</v>

2709
02:22:42.350 --> 02:22:44.490
<v Speaker 3>but seriously that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2710
02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:49.560
<v Speaker 3>you can definitely make an argument that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we go out there that it won't be to </v>

2711
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 3>destroy others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2712
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:54.660
<v Speaker 3>in a benevolent way in</v>

2713
02:22:55.130 --> 02:23:00.130
<v Speaker 4>planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single intelligent animal that's </v>

2714
02:23:00.130 --> 02:23:00.130
<v Speaker 4>less intelligent than us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been slaved.</v>

2715
02:23:00.130 --> 02:23:02.690
<v Speaker 4>We fucked with dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Orca as monkeys,</v>

2716
02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:05.060
<v Speaker 4>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that we can fuck me,</v>

2717
02:23:05.061 --> 02:23:06.980
<v Speaker 4>fuck everything that we can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We eat.</v>

2718
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:10.010
<v Speaker 4>And that is the evidence of every other </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life.</v>

2719
02:23:10.011 --> 02:23:15.011
<v Speaker 4>How it treats that other intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>life that it can manipulate like </v>

2720
02:23:15.011 --> 02:23:17.960
<v Speaker 4>dolphins killing other dolphins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>orcas killing dolphins,</v>

2721
02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:23.190
<v Speaker 3>orchids killing whales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that that is why that </v>

2722
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:26.730
<v Speaker 3>is the reason why we have not yet made </v>
<v Speaker 3>official contact with any type.</v>

2723
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:28.020
<v Speaker 3>So we're not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>

2724
02:23:28.350 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 4>You fucked too many animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what are the top,</v>

2725
02:23:32.390 --> 02:23:37.390
<v Speaker 4>the top five animals that we fuck as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say sheep number one donkeys.</v>

2726
02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:43.090
<v Speaker 4>That Colombian donkey show you ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch that chicken flock of chickens.</v>

2727
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People fucked her dogs for sure.</v>

2728
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:48.950
<v Speaker 4>Then the Dave Chappelle bit about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to fuck him.</v>

2729
02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck him.</v>

2730
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:55.910
<v Speaker 4>Mcgee Mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll take off like a piece of celery </v>

2731
02:23:58.311 --> 02:24:03.311
<v Speaker 4>and throw it in the tall grass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in closing,</v>

2732
02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:09.240
<v Speaker 4>this isn't going crazy at the top five </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

2733
02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:12.040
<v Speaker 4>Took us 20 fucking seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard.</v>

2734
02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Jellyfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was someone really crazy seated.</v>

2735
02:24:16.270 --> 02:24:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Enemy's enemy frog second pocket </v>
<v Speaker 4>flashlight.</v>

2736
02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for chimps,</v>

2737
02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:22.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2738
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Tranquilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met through the front lines and just </v>

2739
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.850
<v Speaker 4>to get off track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that guy,</v>

2740
02:24:29.851 --> 02:24:30.990
<v Speaker 4>that congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got busted.</v>

2741
02:24:30.991 --> 02:24:33.480
<v Speaker 4>He's a furry apparently has been doing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of weird shit.</v>

2742
02:24:33.481 --> 02:24:36.880
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of tiger costume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congressman Lou,</v>

2743
02:24:36.890 --> 02:24:38.880
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his staff's trying to get him to resign.</v>

2744
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:40.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's resigned yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2745
02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:42.570
<v Speaker 4>it's inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a.</v>

2746
02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:45.190
<v Speaker 4>apparently he's out of his fucking mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>dressing up like a tiger.</v>

2747
02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:52.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those kids costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even a cool cut tiger constantly.</v>

2748
02:24:52.051 --> 02:24:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the firies were.</v>

2749
02:24:53.761 --> 02:24:58.761
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about furries in the </v>

2750
02:24:58.761 --> 02:25:00.381
<v Speaker 4>podcast before because I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pittsburgh and they had a furry </v>

2751
02:25:00.381 --> 02:25:02.961
<v Speaker 4>convention at the same time that the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in Pittsburgh and all these firies </v>

2752
02:25:02.961 --> 02:25:07.311
<v Speaker 4>were wandering the streets and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the hotel sent me hip to </v>

2753
02:25:07.311 --> 02:25:07.380
<v Speaker 4>furries because they go to Pittsburgh </v>
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>

2754
02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:08.280
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2755
02:25:08.281 --> 02:25:11.640
<v Speaker 4>the guys that are working in the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you the nutty stories,</v>

2756
02:25:11.641 --> 02:25:15.090
<v Speaker 4>these people shitting and litter boxes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of the furry community actually</v>

2757
02:25:15.091 --> 02:25:17.100
<v Speaker 4>got upset with me that I was spreading </v>
<v Speaker 4>misinformation.</v>

2758
02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say no,</v>

2759
02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.750
<v Speaker 4>you may not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a furry,</v>

2760
02:25:19.751 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 4>you may not be into the dirty aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the furry,</v>

2761
02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:24.490
<v Speaker 4>but there's a broad spectrum of furry </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior folks.</v>

2762
02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:27.510
<v Speaker 4>And just because you're not into taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>shits in letter boxes,</v>

2763
02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that the man who worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>the West and didn't tell me that they </v>

2764
02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:35.611
<v Speaker 4>called down and asked to put a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>litter box in the lobby of the western </v>

2765
02:25:35.611 --> 02:25:37.570
<v Speaker 4>because the firies had every room in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>western.</v>

2766
02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:40.190
<v Speaker 4>So they wanted a litter box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

2767
02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 4>one litter box for everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2769
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:47.350
<v Speaker 4>I asked the guy who was delivering the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food and the room service guy,</v>

2770
02:25:47.351 --> 02:25:51.100
<v Speaker 4>he said that they asked for bose like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the feet on the ground,</v>

2771
02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:52.510

<v Speaker 4>All their food in bowls.</v>

2773
02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:56.050

<v Speaker 4>The bowls are on the ground,</v>

2774
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:58.190
<v Speaker 4>like bowls of milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fast for large bulk.</v>
