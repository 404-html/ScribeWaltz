00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 1>but they are,</v>

153
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.411
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

154
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they probably not live the kind of sexual deviancy that I have gone through,</v>

155
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

156
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And so I just feel that they just seem like wholesome good people,</v>

157
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:11.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>that don't have just this deep dark matter living inside there.</v>

159
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I got up and told his story that I'm about to tell you guys about</v>

160
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>essentially my experience in a fucking orgy.</v>

161
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.891

173
00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

174
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>when you didn't think there were cute stories.</v>

176
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

177
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>

178
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't listen to that hard but,</v>

179
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but I know that people involved,</v>

180
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>they're funny.</v>

181
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of moisture.</v>

182
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.051
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

183
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>the standard Kong moisture is funny as shit.</v>

184
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.271
<v Speaker 1>He's funny.</v>

185
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great sense of humor and the other guys,</v>

186
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen a lot of their work,</v>

187
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:55.641
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be,</v>

188
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>it puts out some pretty bad ass comics.</v>

189
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:57.641
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

191
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>funny fucking people like Amy Poehler came out of there and great people.</v>

192
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And so they're telling their stories and for whatever reason you decided to take</v>

193
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it down per lane.</v>

194
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Tell a story that you never even told me.</v>

195
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never told anybody because you know,</v>

196
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

197
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.031
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

198
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

199
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell something that's a little outrageous because I don't want any</v>

200
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>secrets in my fucking life.</v>

201
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

202
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be fucking out there and I don't give a fuck.</v>

203
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what really care what other people think.</v>

204
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I care what my friends think.</v>

205
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

206
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>my friends all know exactly who the fuck I am.</v>

207
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>All my friends know who I was.</v>

208
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So much freedom in that.</v>

209
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>But there's always freedom and that I can't,</v>

210
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at keeping a facade up.</v>

211
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>So I tell this story.</v>

212
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

213
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>so I'm driving and I go,</v>

214
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I hang on my first impulse,</v>

215
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't do what I can do it.</v>

216
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:37.931
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

217
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:38.561
<v Speaker 1>I had listened,</v>

218
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>there was this thing where you might've told me,</v>

219
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

220
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about a woman who was dying of cancer and they said,</v>

221
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>if you could do it all over again,</v>

222
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.001
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

223
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.340
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

224
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do anything because it made sense.</v>

225
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

226
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that when I got this phone call.</v>

227
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.391
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

228
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:52.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I want to do,</v>

230
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you gotta live your life sometimes and you've got to have experiences and you've</v>

232
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>got to fucking do something that kind of shocks and astonishes yourself.</v>

233
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

234
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't know a guy out there who wouldn't want to fuck six girls at the same</v>

235
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:06.401
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

236
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>So I hear that.</v>

237
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>But I'm driving and I,</v>

238
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>my first info,</v>

239
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

240
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go get it.</v>

241
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I've got to study my audition.</v>

242
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I got an audition tomorrow,</v>

243
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.471
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm thinking,</v>

244
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.011
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

245
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 1>And he's going,</v>

246
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

247
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.241
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'll do?</v>

248
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drive.</v>

249
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>If I see a seven 11 I'll stop and get condoms.</v>

250
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I'm going there.</v>

251
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to him my,</v>

252
00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to stop and maybe if I get another call,</v>

253
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>no good.</v>

254
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.293
<v Speaker 1>Some other,</v>

255
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.811
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

256
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.480
<v Speaker 1>a seven 11 I'm going to pull up,</v>

257
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely not going in this chair it and there's no way I blow off.</v>

258
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:30.581
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

259
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

260
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have any condoms.</v>

261
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Buy Condoms.</v>

262
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.843
<v Speaker 1>Phone rings again.</v>

263
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck are you?</v>

264
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>So while this was going on,</v>

265
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you're basically like a junkie that someone's saying,</v>

266
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.131
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

267
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>let's do some blow.</v>

268
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not basically like a junkie.</v>

269
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I am a junkie.</v>

270
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.703
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

271
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

272
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>But that feeling when you're about to do something really deviant is junky.</v>

273
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Junky my heart and my heart's beating fast and I'm getting,</v>

274
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and I can't get it out of my mind.</v>

275
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to it.</v>

276
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I keep trying to put it out in my mind and I'm a loser and man,</v>

277
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing the battle.</v>

278
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting pulled under.</v>

279
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>They're adding more and more weight and I'm trying to keep up.</v>

280
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I got my,</v>

281
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

282
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

283
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't go under water.</v>

284
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.311
<v Speaker 1>I keep doing this.</v>

285
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm treading water,</v>

286
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>but they're just adding weights to my legs with the imagery.</v>

287
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about these girls.</v>

288
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Long story short,</v>

289
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:11.031
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

290
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

291
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I find myself at the Sheraton.</v>

292
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I go up to the suite,</v>

293
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I get met at the door by my girl.</v>

294
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>She's wearing a mask.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If it did,</v>

594
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.311
<v Speaker 1>and if it did,</v>

595
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.031
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>

596
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.240
<v Speaker 1>because I wouldn't have felt that anyway.</v>

609
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:39.371
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

610

611
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.571
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

612
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>this is an experience I'm already done.</v>

613
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm already fucked.</v>

614
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.433
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.840
<v Speaker 1>so he can't get up.</v>

616
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.901
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:47.411
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

618
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

619
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.060
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

620
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

621

622
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.714
<v Speaker 1>I can't get in.</v>

623
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And she turns around and goes,</v>

624
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:51.761
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

625

627
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I told her I didn't want to do it.</v>

628
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And they start having a fight about not being able to get on her ass as I'm</v>

629
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>having sex with her and they're having a fight.</v>

630
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:00.881
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking to myself,</v>

631
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:01.541
<v Speaker 1>I look around and I'm like,</v>

632
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:01.811
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

633
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>this is the beginning of the end and this relationship,</v>

634
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.690
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird thing to have a fight about a,</v>

635
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 1>there's another issue that,</v>

636
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:10.800
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

640
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.021
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

641
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:11.381
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

642
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.214
<v Speaker 1>But there's swingers,</v>

643
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

644
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.270
<v Speaker 1>so he can't get in.</v>

645
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>They have this fight and then he kind of storms off and she kind of goes back to</v>

646
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>me and we do our thing.</v>

647
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:19.931
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

648
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

649

<v Speaker 1>there goes my reputation by the way.</v>

651
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 1>And so now it comes time for me to,</v>

652
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>she wants me to finish it off in a porn fashion,</v>

653
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 1>which would be again in her mouth.</v>

654
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I go,</v>

655
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

656

<v Speaker 1>But I've,</v>

738
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good at getting,</v>

739
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I think my friends until I was pretty good at getting a group of great open</v>

740
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.180
<v Speaker 1>minded girls together and hoggin off.</v>

741
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing to talk about though,</v>

742
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

743
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing to talk about because when you,</v>

744
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>when you start saying,</v>

745
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:39.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 1>banged all these girls,</v>

747
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I bang this girl by now you open yourself up to people getting angry.</v>

748
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

749
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't.</v>

750
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't.</v>

751
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

752
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't because,</v>

753
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>because I do anything wrong.</v>

754
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything wrong and,</v>

755
00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:49.491
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

756
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and I would do it again and I had a blast.</v>

757
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I have fucking blast and it's true.</v>

758
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And it turned me on is that turned me on.</v>

759
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to turn me on you,</v>

760
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you throw a bunch of like six really cool girls in a room and they're all like,</v>

762
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 1>we want to fuck you.</v>

763
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that turns me on.</v>

764
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

765
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>it turns me off.</v>

766
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Gets me going.</v>

767
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

768
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.451
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

769
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:08.991
<v Speaker 1>it's a crime.</v>

770
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:09.501
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

771
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm down.</v>

772
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.851
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny though,</v>

773
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:11.351
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

774
00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you think about this,</v>

775
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>like the way people describe it,</v>

776
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:15.830
<v Speaker 1>like this is a fucked up thing to talk about.</v>

777
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

778
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.171
<v Speaker 1>the tricky thing,</v>

779
00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

780
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:17.631
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

781
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:18.441
<v Speaker 1>it's taboo because I,</v>

782
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was telling the story of UCB,</v>

783
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 1>it was actually kind of an experiment.</v>

784
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

785
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what happens to this audience.</v>

786
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>When I tell a real story about something that most people would never admit to</v>

787
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 1>because it makes you look to a lot of people bad.</v>

788
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It may or it makes you look like a pervert,</v>

789
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe in that shit.</v>

790
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it and anybody knows me knows.</v>

791
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not hung up on that stuff.</v>

792
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not.</v>

793
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.351
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

794
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

795
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

796
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't change that experience for the fucking world.</v>

797
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:43.730
<v Speaker 1>What's that guy's name?</v>

798
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Vincent Gallo is what his name is,</v>

799
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.190
<v Speaker 1>who they want to do that movie brown butter.</v>

800
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.330
<v Speaker 1>We're Chloe and she still has a career and she blew him in the movie the movie</v>

801
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and in the scene she actually sucks his dick and he keeps,</v>

802
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>especially women when,</v>

803
00:16:59.570 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

804
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.580
<v Speaker 1>what I notice about,</v>

805
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

806
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I told that story,</v>

807
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of women in the,</v>

808
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and UCB women were really open when women were really like,</v>

809
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.950
<v Speaker 1>found like I had a couple women say hi,</v>

810
00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I found that story really honest and refreshing.</v>

811
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.281
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

812
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

813
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>and how do you end it?</v>

814
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.643
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

815
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>It was a slippery slope once you,</v>

816
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.200
<v Speaker 1>like if somebody calls you about an orgy,</v>

817
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>if you don't turn around and drive home immediately and throw handcuffs on</v>

818
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:22.094
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

819
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>anything else is a slippery slope and you're going down that slope.</v>

820
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If you're a guy like me.</v>

821
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>So you got to fucking,</v>

822
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:28.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

824
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.571
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

825
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and you know that story about getting a call,</v>

826
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>like that is what a lot of us deal with on a day to day basis with our</v>

827
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:37.671
<v Speaker 1>addictions.</v>

828
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:38.061
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's,</v>

829
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stop smoking,</v>

830
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stop drinking,</v>

831
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stop fucking watching porn all day,</v>

832
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:44.451
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

833
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>People have these addictions trying to stop meth.</v>

834
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stop heroin.</v>

835
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.961
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

836
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it's the same addiction,</v>

837
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:49.501
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

838
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:50.251
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

839
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the same impulse.</v>

840
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

841
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:57.531
<v Speaker 1>and so just to suggest that I don't have some of that in me and that I in the</v>

842
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>past haven't acted on,</v>

843
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>that is dishonest.</v>

844
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.141
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

845
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 1>his concern is suggesting I'm not human.</v>

846
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

847
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a judgment on that,</v>

848
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was awesome.</v>

849
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.951
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

850
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's how it is.</v>
