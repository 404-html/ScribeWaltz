127
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.720

<v Speaker 3>Early years at Arizona State.</v>

128
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.870
<v Speaker 3>My freshman year I would go get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to Mcdonald's actually like on a </v>

129
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.101
<v Speaker 3>Sunday and read the newspaper and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl working there was just a.</v>

130
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.210
<v Speaker 3>She was just overly positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I order a big Mac Combo and she </v>

131
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 3>guys keep them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you wanted to see the trailer for </v>

133
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Brody's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neisha let,</v>

134
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 3>let's just talk for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll show it later.</v>

135
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was just like so nice and like,</v>

136
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and she was a slightly handicapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the point.</v>

137
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Should I just remember she would slide </v>
<v Speaker 3>it across the,</v>

138
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the counter there and to go enjoy and it</v>

139
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

140
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like she's really into her job and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's big dot.</v>

141
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It's Mcdonald's and she doesn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

142
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw her working at Wendy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the corner.</v>

143
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.180
<v Speaker 3>This is a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went in there and ordered a chocolate </v>

144
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 3>frosty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which at the time wasn't available.</v>

145
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 3>I updated that because at one point it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was only frosties.</v>

146
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chocolate for you update it yourself.</v>

147
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

148
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day like chocolate frosties </v>

149
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 3>and vanilla frosties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only chocolate frosty.</v>

150
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So see when you go to Wendy's and you </v>

151
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 3>said I'm going to get a chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 3>frosty.</v>

152
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>It was redundant because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have other options.</v>

153
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 3>This is in the 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

154
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 3>going through the drive through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get my drink and my food,</v>

155
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 3>the double double and she reaches out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she goes,</v>

156
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 3>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Lady,</v>

157
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 3>different restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast food.</v>

158
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess she decided that was her </v>
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>

159
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:23.471
<v Speaker 3>like maybe she dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked double shifts and it just stuck </v>

160
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:23.471
<v Speaker 3>in my mind.</v>

161
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I brought it around the </v>

162
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>baseball team at Arizona state and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Enjoy us.</v>

165
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 3>It just kind of took a life of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

166
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 3>She stepped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She went from Mcdonald's.</v>

167
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.821
<v Speaker 3>Wendy's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wendy's is probably higher quality </v>

168
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:39.821
<v Speaker 3>burger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>better taste and probably a better gig </v>

175
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.020
<v Speaker 3>and you're sitting down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you were.</v>

<v Speaker 3>mom used to work for the headquarters </v>

<v Speaker 3>and he would dress up as Santa Claus </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>

181
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And as a kid I have all these photos of </v>

<v Speaker 3>I will you be quiet about Santa Claus </v>

<v Speaker 3>I've been dumping drinks over p a n o a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mannequin panic.</v>

234
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are quick silver and fibia shorts.</v>

235
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 3>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can wear them in the water.</v>

236
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's called the secret plug.</v>

237
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I see what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love to work with water on yourself on </v>

238
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 3>purpose to get quick silver migration or</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy central show.</v>

239
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.530
<v Speaker 3>You're a very smart guy in that respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you submitted the nets that have </v>

240
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.530
<v Speaker 3>been chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you wouldn't know it.</v>

241
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 3>There's somebody who knows it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody who knows.</v>

242
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 3>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

243
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:48.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spilt water on the court to kind of </v>

244
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 3>delay the game against the Lakers the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other night because it's a,</v>

245
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 3>they were losing and they had to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>time out or something.</v>

246
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 3>And so once the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

247
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:58.070
<v Speaker 3>spilled the court water on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to clean it up and while </v>

248
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.070
<v Speaker 3>they're cleaning up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they designed to play.</v>

249
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of cheating.</v>

250
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 3>There's been a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

251
00:10:59.911 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 3>two</v>

252
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.740
<v Speaker 1>things over the years where guys have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done various things in the octagon that </v>

253
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>were illegal to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

254
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>to make things more slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like vaseline.</v>

255
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the UFC,</v>

256
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 1>when you throw water on the canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually gives you more traction.</v>

257
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does?</v>

258
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys actually throw water on the ground </v>

259
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:20.830
<v Speaker 1>before they fight and then they step </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that legal or no?</v>

260
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

262
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

263
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to pour too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>water on yourself.</v>

264
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you'll see the referee </v>
<v Speaker 1>drying a guy off.</v>

265
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before he goes out for the next round.</v>

266
00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:35.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like say if you're fighting a </v>

267
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 1>grappler and you come out completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>soaking wet,</v>

268
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 1>like literally dripping wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way harder to grab you.</v>

269
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:44.801
<v Speaker 1>Your slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You slip out of things like you're the </v>

270
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:44.801
<v Speaker 1>swim pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.911
<v Speaker 1>And that's slipperiness can make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between a submission and an </v>

272
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:48.911
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>

273
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Like it's that it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oil.</v>

275
00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys have oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oil up like uh,</v>

276
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>baby oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

277
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cheating,</v>

278
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

279
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that guys have done is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

280
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been rumored that they lie and </v>

281
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.471
<v Speaker 1>mineral baths at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take this bath with a mineral </v>

282
00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>oils and they just soak in it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking like an hour or whatever.</v>

283
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And then they take a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

284
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And then when they sweat the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the skin is dry,</v>

285
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>when they started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they sweat,</v>

286
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>they are just so lit as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're not technically illegal.</v>

287
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not technically illegal because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are clean.</v>

288
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you touch them,</v>

289
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>not going to feel like an oily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no health benefit from it.</v>

291
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's probably good for your </v>

292
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.590
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really keeps you lovely.</v>

293
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I try to take a mineral oil bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who is a actually kicked</v>

294
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:40.970
<v Speaker 1>out a coroner's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

295
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I dunno for life or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was for a long time because he </v>

296
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.161
<v Speaker 1>was rubbing vaseline on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would like do this chest massage </v>

297
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 1>thing while I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rubbing vaseline on them.</v>

298
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>He rubbed their neck and he was rubbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaseline on them.</v>

299
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 1>He was actually making them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>slippery.</v>

300
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>She has a latent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

301
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 1>it was his corner man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was blatant.</v>

302
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

303
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:07.621
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who used to work with </v>

304
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>fighters that claim to be like a witch </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>

305
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:13.591
<v Speaker 1>They called them the witch doctor and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had this whole series of things that he </v>

306
00:13:13.591 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>would do to guys to like align their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shockers and shit.</v>

307
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what Angelo.</v>

308
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Dundee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

309
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the gentleman's name,</v>

310
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but he used to rub dudes chests and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a circle and pat their neck and this is </v>

311
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>corner man was doing that right after he</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied vaseline to his face.</v>

312
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>So whether or not it was intentional is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.670
<v Speaker 1>only he knows that what he was doing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this Voodoo move with vaseline on </v>

314
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 1>his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

315
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of illegal.</v>

316
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Any he might not have realized he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>just put vaseline on his face.</v>

317
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva did it wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he wiped vaseline off of his face and</v>

318
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>put it on his chest and his arms like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of everybody.</v>

319
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that in boxing.</v>

320
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.460
<v Speaker 1>They put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>On your faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

322
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a big difference is having on your</v>

323
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 1>arms and chest.</v>

324
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then if guys go to clinch up </v>

325
00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he slipped away from them and you know,</v>

326
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Anderson did it like really blatantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>one fight.</v>

327
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't let them do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make sure you know,</v>

329
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:09.511
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta realize MMA is only 20 years </v>

330
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:09.511
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still meet.</v>

331
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>We just celebrated the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate its 20th anniversary,</v>

332
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:15.781
<v Speaker 1>so like there's a lot of rules like have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get made up along the way and it's </v>

333
00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:18.210
<v Speaker 1>still evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still some fuckery afoot pretty Stevens,</v>

334
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

335
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to change all that much </v>

336
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.171
<v Speaker 1>over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it could use a few </v>

337
00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:28.171
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be easy food changes,</v>

338
00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>but it might be say like a golf or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tennis,</v>

339
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>which is Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:35.280
<v Speaker 1>over the years I guess those gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

341
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.320
<v Speaker 1>sports mma will never be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so you think it will </v>

342
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>evolve into different rules or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

343
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.980
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to be really primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what would its appeal is,</v>

344
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 1>its appeal is and in this water down </v>
<v Speaker 1>society where everything's nerfed and </v>

345
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the whole world is fucking sanitary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one sport where shit gets</v>

346
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 4>real as real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as fun.</v>

347
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.140
<v Speaker 4>It does two dudes who are pushing </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves for five minutes per round in</v>

348
00:14:58.141 --> 00:15:03.141
<v Speaker 4>a championship match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about 25 minutes of </v>

349
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.340
<v Speaker 4>ferocity in Connecticut Energy and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking and sweat and blood and </v>

350
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 4>injuries and through things and trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to overcome.</v>

351
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking,</v>

352
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.560
<v Speaker 4>it's primal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Primal gets the most exciting sport of </v>

353
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 4>all time and you're right up there with </v>
<v Speaker 4>baseball.</v>

354
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare you know,</v>

355
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 4>daily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even compare those.</v>

356
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people complain about ground,</v>

357
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 4>fighting over a guy holding a guy down </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ground and I'm like,</v>

358
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 4>as boring as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not as boring as baseball.</v>

359
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

360
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't watch a lot of baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You watch plenty.</v>

361
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like going watch too much.</v>

362
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have much.</v>

363
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Not very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much is not very much.</v>

364
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

365
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't honestly,</v>

366
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't watch a lot of TV.</v>

367
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 4>Don't lie to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brody Stevens.</v>

368
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what I like about </v>
<v Speaker 4>baseball.</v>

369
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I like going down early before the fans </v>
<v Speaker 4>get there,</v>

370
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with the team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching the batting practice,</v>

371
00:15:56.901 --> 00:16:01.901
<v Speaker 4>playing grab ass if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to call it that 10 percent </v>

372
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:02.800
<v Speaker 4>having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

373
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 4>that's what I then stay for a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>innings and then go home.</v>

374
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like your sense of humor </v>

375
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.341
<v Speaker 4>actually was kind of developed from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comradery of like hanging out with guys </v>

376
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 4>that you were playing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that makes sense that you would enjoy</v>

377
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 4>that camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like enjoy it.</v>

378
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It in a simple like making and making </v>

379
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 4>everybody laugh that you got that </v>
<v Speaker 4>camaraderie of like teammates,</v>

380
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 4>like working out together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out together.</v>

381
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Like people who've never experienced </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of environment.</v>

382
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 4>They don't really totally understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do they?</v>

383
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think not only because,</v>

384
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.870
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to play baseball and first of all </v>

385
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 4>at Arizona state and we're flying </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

386
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 4>We had to be professionals and represent</v>
<v Speaker 4>the university.</v>

387
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 4>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going off the plane,</v>

388
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 4>the summertime up to Alaska and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're up there and you're meeting guys </v>

389
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 4>from different schools and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

390
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:02.111
<v Speaker 4>you're traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sharing hotel rooms and lot of </v>

391
00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 4>those experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

392
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll the locker room stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the parties and the jokes on the bus</v>

393
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 4>and getting in trouble as a team at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

394
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm dad helped us define who I am.</v>

395
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:16.750
<v Speaker 4>It defined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

396
00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

397
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having that,</v>

398
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody could use.</v>

399
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>competing in a sport is that you go when</v>

400
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 4>you hang out with a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are also doing the same thing and you </v>

401
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 4>learn together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

402
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I think that's missing from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

403
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:36.641
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's missing from a lot of </v>

404
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:36.641
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never get involved in sports.</v>

405
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would add would after the.</v>

406
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean my freshman year I would always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I wasn't a top guy so I didn't </v>

407
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 4>get the instruction from the coaches </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the top recruit.</v>

408
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:51.251
<v Speaker 4>So I would go to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other pitchers of senior pictures </v>

409
00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:51.251
<v Speaker 4>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you guys</v>

410
00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 3>help me out a little bit with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanics?</v>

411
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 3>And there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big a window where you can look in and</v>

412
00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 3>work on your throwing mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys would work with me,</v>

413
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.610
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew the coach was focusing on these </v>

414
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 3>other guys and I never got upset about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

415
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good enough.</v>

416
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I just said I want to become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

417
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.840
<v Speaker 3>the best picture I could be and work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mechanics difference in pitching </v>

418
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.981
<v Speaker 3>between the really awesome dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys would get scouted and a guy </v>

419
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference?</v>

420
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

421
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did get scouted,</v>

422
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 3>but I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

423
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.580
<v Speaker 3>what they look for today is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

424
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.600
<v Speaker 3>size is a Gigaton of fill into his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

425
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having long arms,</v>

426
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good attitude,</v>

427
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a motion going to be where </v>

428
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 3>they're not gonna hurt their shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt their arms.</v>

429
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.810
<v Speaker 3>So they're motion as far as the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw.</v>

430
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see a guy how he throws,</v>

431
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:53.421
<v Speaker 3>like naturally he may throw we strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I can see an injury coming on if </v>

432
00:18:55.021 --> 00:19:00.021
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't adjust that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas some guys had jeff perfect </v>

433
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:04.100
<v Speaker 3>smooth mechanics and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very specific technique when it </v>

434
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 3>comes to throwing a hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

435
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.100
<v Speaker 3>there's specific techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas and then there's,</v>

436
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean within that there's some coaches </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some philosophies that have </v>

437
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.280
<v Speaker 3>variations on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

438
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 3>but there's a few famous guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>deviate,</v>

439
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they go,</v>

440
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 3>they throw side arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

441
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Their side armors are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a sidearm or could be.</v>

442
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get more action.</v>

443
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:28.380
<v Speaker 3>They throw over the top and there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>an okay picture,</v>

444
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:33.381
<v Speaker 3>but they figured out that those side arm</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that book's act different action on </v>

445
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:37.611
<v Speaker 3>the ball and some guys can't do that or </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do that or you don't have </v>

446
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 3>to show baseball.</v>

447
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's brody pitching at Arizona State </v>

448
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 3>pitchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brody,</v>

449
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 3>you're on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I have one video of me pitching </v>

450
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you do?</v>

451
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I gave up a home run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the alumni game.</v>

452
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 3>It's the only time you've ever pitched?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

453
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I patched my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pitched,</v>

454
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I think my record was foreign one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pitched three years.</v>

455
00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I was injured here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I pitched.</v>

456
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I was four and one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I had a few saves.</v>

457
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:07.371
<v Speaker 3>My era was three point something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I 28 strike out and maybe had 31.</v>

458
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I had more strikeouts per innings and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a 11 walk.</v>

459
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.420
<v Speaker 3>What's that one crazy surgery that </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball players,</v>

460
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Tommy Johns elective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tommy John Surgery.</v>

461
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a ligament out of your wrist </v>

462
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 3>and you put it in your elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

463
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda what it was.</v>

464
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:24.410
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

465
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 3>back in the day it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say you hurt your right arm.</v>

466
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 3>They would probably take the poll maris </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendon at the time.</v>

467
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So they would usually take it out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

468
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 3>your left wrist and they put it in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your right elbow.</v>

469
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 3>And they would do a figure eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of tightened it up.</v>

470
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

471
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tommy John.</v>

472
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:47.331
<v Speaker 3>Now they'll take maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ligament from your leg</v>

473
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 2>or maybe a dead body or even your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same arm and they put it in there.</v>

474
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:56.330
<v Speaker 2>So over the years it's gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the surgery is,</v>

475
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.000
<v Speaker 2>is become more common place</v>

476
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 1>elective surgery on some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys they don't even have an </v>

477
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.941
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it because it gives them more </v>

478
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:06.941
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

479
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:06.941
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say no.</v>

480
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

481
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

482
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I know guys have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That baseball players that have said my </v>

483
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 1>arm's fine guys have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

484
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's been high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>pros,</v>

485
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but I know it was reading an article </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

486
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:23.221
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a Tommy John Surgery who </v>

487
00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 1>shares the same birthday as me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

488
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Tommy John Surgery too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still paid similar Tommy John </v>

489
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next steroids.</v>

490
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at this when it comes to high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and college sports,</v>

491
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>young athletes often urine for bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles to enhance their performance,</v>

492
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.700
<v Speaker 1>but for student baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitcher strength isn't so much of a </v>

493
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.071
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is speed throwing speed and now </v>

494
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:46.291
<v Speaker 1>student athlete's looking for a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get extra boost in their pitching arm </v>

495
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:49.530
<v Speaker 1>had been putting their hopes in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elective surgery surgery called the </v>

496
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Ulnar collateral ligament </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstruction.</v>

497
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 1>More famously known as Tommy John.</v>

498
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had something very similar to that.</v>

499
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.770
<v Speaker 2>There's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says that,</v>

500
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it on purpose.</v>

501
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I've read many articles about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like a secret or these high </v>

502
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:04.400
<v Speaker 1>schoolers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are.</v>

503
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school and college athletes.</v>

504
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

505
00:22:07.611 --> 00:22:12.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for bringing that up and I </v>

506
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:14.321
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this is the Joe Rogan experience </v>

507
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:14.321
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to learn stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

508
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I learned that if you're asking me right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

509
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.760
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a major leaguer that has </v>

510
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 2>electively like one of these kids in </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school and we know we have a </v>

511
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.140
<v Speaker 2>problem with high schools and parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pressure of all that.</v>

512
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Is there a major leaguer currently or </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the past year or two who is </v>

513
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.920
<v Speaker 2>electively gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-injury,</v>

514
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 2>electively taken that surgery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued to be in the major leagues and</v>

515
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe improved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guess is no,</v>

516
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.040
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my instinct.</v>

517
00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That's my guess is that has it has not </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

518
00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what happens with this high </v>

519
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 2>school kid or anything.</v>

520
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You know though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all these kids are getting it done,</v>

521
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have gotten that done?</v>

522
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

523
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Because why would you say that?</v>

524
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>

525
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.880
<v Speaker 2>If you tear your ligament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need the surgery.</v>

526
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have the ligament and it's </v>

527
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Speaker 2>chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily torn.</v>

528
00:23:21.021 --> 00:23:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It's worn down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's off the bone.</v>

529
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.170
<v Speaker 2>You're probably going to need the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery and the reason why these guys </v>

530
00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:34.361
<v Speaker 2>come back stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not because the ligament is </v>

531
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:38.231
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that may have something to do </v>

532
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:40.511
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people also think it's the </v>

533
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:43.271
<v Speaker 2>training because you hurt your elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to really go extra </v>

534
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 2>and out of the way to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow is strong,</v>

535
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 2>so when you're doing the rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reaching into the ice,</v>

536
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you're doing all the ultrasound on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow,</v>

537
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 2>the exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing extra actually,</v>

538
00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 2>and that's another reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back stronger and I do think that </v>

539
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you bionic,</v>

540
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.140
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of guys have come back for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that surgery and a thrown harder and if </v>

541
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 2>continued their career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's yet to be known.</v>

542
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>If a guy who elects to do it in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school or college,</v>

543
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.730
<v Speaker 2>it's going to make them throw harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

544
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:24.070
<v Speaker 2>if they're hurting and they got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand if they're having chronic </v>

545
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.581
<v Speaker 2>pains in their elbow and their mechanics</v>
<v Speaker 2>are such where it's not going to get </v>

546
00:24:27.581 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only going to get worse.</v>

547
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 2>So you better adjust your mechanics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of that,</v>

548
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get the Tommy John Surgery and see</v>

549
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

550
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Injury has been proven to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant effect on the mechanics of </v>

551
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.720
<v Speaker 1>your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes your arms stronger.</v>

552
00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it throw faster.</v>

553
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>

554
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that because I </v>

555
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.800
<v Speaker 1>don't think you've got it done and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are saying it is.</v>

556
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.010
<v Speaker 1>All these doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not based.</v>

557
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.720
<v Speaker 1>They're not pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:24:52.721 --> 00:24:55.720
<v Speaker 1>But they're working with pitchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about.</v>

559
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.010
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about getting this done </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a year to recover.</v>

560
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost two years actually to it.</v>

561
00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Most guys come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully strength back to normal,</v>

562
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.690
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half to two years,</v>

563
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.090
<v Speaker 1>put some more strength in your elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the risks are that,</v>

564
00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:18.091
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes after their elbow gets </v>

565
00:25:18.091 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed or just the add this </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional ligament,</v>

566
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes permanently stiff and their </v>

567
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.281
<v Speaker 1>muscles tear or they can have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called I magenic physician induced </v>

568
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>problems with their elbows because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surgery.</v>

569
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Say That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

570
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

571
00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating that people are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

572
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 1>that guys are going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small trend either.</v>

573
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few guys that are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the doctor and they,</v>

574
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 1>they think the doctors saying that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the doctors explaining the </v>

575
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.860
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation process and how long it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>

576
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:53.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll take like up to a year to recover </v>

577
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:57.251
<v Speaker 1>is what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're saying that it does have a </v>

578
00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 1>significant impact</v>

579
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.060
<v Speaker 2>on May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my phone.</v>

580
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>The throwing harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

581
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:12.010
<v Speaker 2>That's my opinion at mile at might allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to whip your arm more like more arm </v>

583
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>whip [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>But arm whip is not.</v>

584
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's going to add a mile or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

585
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.460
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not a believer in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

586
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see a major leaguer that has </v>

587
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.310
<v Speaker 2>had that done and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

588
00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 2>and electively with no injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a cron.</v>

589
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I had the surgery done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a tear.</v>

590
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I had chronic injuries in my elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My elbow wasn't getting better.</v>

591
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I had bad mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an MRI and they go,</v>

592
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ligament,</v>

593
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:48.741
<v Speaker 2>I see damage in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell there is damage in your </v>

594
00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:48.741
<v Speaker 2>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

595
00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he asked me,</v>

596
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may need Tommy John Surgery,</v>

597
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 2>do you want to take the tendon out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your left elbow,</v>

598
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 2>left wrist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

599
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did the surgery and he saw that</v>

600
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:03.951
<v Speaker 2>my ligament was intact and he stapled it</v>
<v Speaker 2>back down to the bone and he tightened </v>

601
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 2>me up and that wasn't the Tommy John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Surgery.</v>

602
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

603
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

604
00:27:09.791 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently also about the rehabilitation</v>

605
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 1>that that's really what's helping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's not necessarily the,</v>

606
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing harder throwing.</v>

607
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the ligament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it might just be the </v>

608
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.241
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis that you put into </v>

609
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:26.241
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation that yeah,</v>

610
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:26.241
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can do,</v>

611
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can do that on your.</v>

612
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Once you do that in any way.</v>

613
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually pretty </v>

614
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:34.840
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna I'm gonna.</v>

615
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Ask around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

616
00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

617
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I W I would wait until you have a </v>

618
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.320
<v Speaker 2>chronic injury or it pops in tears like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:27:42.321 --> 00:27:43.640
<v Speaker 2>you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:47.420
<v Speaker 2>mine was a chronic buildup thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was due to bad mechanics,</v>

621
00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:52.400
<v Speaker 2>so if you have bad mechanics and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>this elective surgery ahead of time,</v>

622
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.070
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to have bad mechanics</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>

623
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Some people have to get a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

624
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tear it again.</v>

625
00:27:59.931 --> 00:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

626
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's super common with the knees guys </v>

627
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.070
<v Speaker 1>who have acl reconstructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they blow it out all the time.</v>

628
00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I can think of several fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominick Cruz,</v>

629
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.890
<v Speaker 1>current bantamweight champion had his </v>
<v Speaker 1>acl reconstructed,</v>

630
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 1>blew it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to have it done again.</v>

631
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.100
<v Speaker 1>So He's been out almost two years when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he fights Hanan Barao the unify,</v>

632
00:28:18.101 --> 00:28:23.101
<v Speaker 1>the title barrel had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a crown in the interim </v>

633
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.711
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hennen and Michael Mcdonald went </v>

634
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:25.711
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great fight.</v>

635
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And Hanan Barao became the interim </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

636
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And now because he's the interim </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion or is it?</v>

637
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he win the title from?</v>

638
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong about that?</v>

639
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Michael Mcdonald challenge for the </v>

640
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.041
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think brow beat somebody else for the </v>

641
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:44.041
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Anyway,</v>

642
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

643
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.760
<v Speaker 1>the instances of guys getting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees reconstructed and blowing them out</v>

644
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.340
<v Speaker 1>again is real high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same knee,</v>

645
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.220
<v Speaker 1>same knee or the other knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had both my knees reconstructed.</v>

646
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Derek rose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you follow basketball.</v>

647
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>He blew out his left knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is on the bowls that he's a million </v>

648
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.740
<v Speaker 2>dollar $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>player and he blew out his knee.</v>

649
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.710
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess his left one of his knees and he</v>

650
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:16.711
<v Speaker 2>took a year off and people gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard time because people do come back </v>

651
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:17.770
<v Speaker 2>actually after nine or 10 months with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acl.</v>

652
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't come back and then he came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back this year and he was playing and he</v>

653
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>did the same thing to his other knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

654
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

655
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I was helen burroughs incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He defended against Michael Mcdonald.</v>

656
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:33.680
<v Speaker 1>He won the title with the decision over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Uriah Faber.</v>

657
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I should've known that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was way back in January or July of </v>

658
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.711
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dominick Cruz had been rehabbing all </v>

659
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:45.491
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the sidelines even before </v>

660
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 1>then because they had to come up with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interim title back then.</v>

661
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The poor guy has been out for two whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

662
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy due to these knee issue knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

663
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with him it's very important because</v>

664
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:59.701
<v Speaker 1>his style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably got the most elaborate </v>

665
00:29:59.701 --> 00:30:02.161
<v Speaker 1>footwork style in all of mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude is tireless and he goes five </v>

666
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:07.501
<v Speaker 1>rounds of constant moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the problems with fighting </v>

667
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:07.501
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never there.</v>

668
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:07.501
<v Speaker 1>He's like a willow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wisp,</v>

669
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

670
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:13.471
<v Speaker 1>his footwork is spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a guy who was coming back from </v>

671
00:30:13.471 --> 00:30:17.460
<v Speaker 1>essentially two significant operations </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his knee and two years on the shelf </v>

672
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's got that crazy style.</v>

673
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>

674
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:25.381
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing guys like coby Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into Germany and getting some of </v>

675
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:30.541
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they do in Germany I had done </v>

676
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:30.860
<v Speaker 1>here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called Regina keen ahead,</v>

677
00:30:30.861 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>head and neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic.</v>

678
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It does work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing what a,</v>

679
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 1>what's it's called Magento keen or Ortho</v>
<v Speaker 1>keen and in Germany,</v>

680
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magento kind,</v>

681
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 1>keen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

682
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 1>they take your blood out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a lot of it,</v>

683
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 1>like almost a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they expose it to environmental</v>

684
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:51.000
<v Speaker 1>factors and spinning it in a centrifuge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing that.</v>

685
00:30:51.001 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It produces this reaction to the heat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they expose it to.</v>

686
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Produces this yellow liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most potent anti </v>

687
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory drug known to man produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by your own body,</v>

688
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

689
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's amazing stuff and they now do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Santa Monica that they do it in </v>

690
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>

691
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it at a couple different,</v>

692
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:16.921
<v Speaker 1>I think they do in Vegas now as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fighters are experienced miraculous </v>

693
00:31:16.921 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 1>results with us and know Chris Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't done on his knees.</v>

694
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 1>A lot of different fighters are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it done and different parts of their </v>

695
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their backs especially,</v>

696
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 1>so they're waiting to their injured to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

697
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does no benefit.</v>

698
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 1>If you were an injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just anti inflammatory,</v>

699
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:34.290
<v Speaker 1>so don't take it unless you are hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who are hurt like elbow </v>

700
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sore elbow,</v>

701
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:40.651
<v Speaker 1>sore knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience profound changes because of </v>

702
00:31:40.651 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing and it's healthy.</v>

703
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally healthy.</v>

704
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 1>It's your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your own body.</v>

705
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing dangerous about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

706
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:52.411
<v Speaker 1>but what's really fascinating is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are figuring out all these </v>

707
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:53.650
<v Speaker 1>different ways to get your body to heal </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

708
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially what they're doing.</v>

709
00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.240
<v Speaker 1>They're reintroducing your body's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti inflammatory response to get it to </v>

710
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.510
<v Speaker 1>fix itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing,</v>

711
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

712
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really like,</v>

713
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible shit and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing this now.</v>

714
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to have in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

715
00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to have in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

716
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will they have because they're going</v>

717
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:15.270
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think within our lifetimes we're going</v>

718
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:20.271
<v Speaker 1>to see genetic genetic manipulation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where they can alter your </v>

719
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:20.271
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

720
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

721
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>hgh for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is available to the public.</v>

722
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

723
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get.</v>

724
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>There's certain companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to make.</v>

725
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.420
<v Speaker 1>It's called secretagogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

726
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

727
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 1>an hgh that is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>

728
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if you'd have to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor's prescription because what it </v>

729
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.871
<v Speaker 1>does is it stimulates your body's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of hgh using a certain </v>

730
00:32:46.871 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 1>combination of amino acids and minerals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

731
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely stimulate the growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it with amino acids.</v>

732
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:58.060
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much been proven that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could raise your levels significantly </v>

733
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:02.230
<v Speaker 1>where you could see it will show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>several percent and that you would get </v>

734
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:06.461
<v Speaker 1>benefit out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like real human growth </v>

735
00:33:06.461 --> 00:33:09.251
<v Speaker 1>hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Sarah is so tropin and that kind of </v>

736
00:33:09.251 --> 00:33:09.251
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get it from a doctor.</v>

737
00:33:09.251 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is available that's prescribed and</v>

738
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:13.270
<v Speaker 1>most sports it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

739
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's prescribed and I know they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these one anti aging clinics in Florida </v>

740
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 1>and the guy's gotten exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where these guys go.</v>

741
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Is that good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that,</v>

742
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>is that something that people take and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not a blank statement?</v>

743
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Is Salt good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

744
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you need a pound,</v>

745
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

746
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.740
<v Speaker 1>So you know by asking his hgh or human </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone and testosterone and at </v>

747
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 1>these doses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

748
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is good for you.</v>

749
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 1>But it also improves performance without</v>
<v Speaker 1>a doubt.</v>

750
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And the question is should you be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do that and compete in </v>

751
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 1>sports?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

752
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a big argument with that </v>

753
00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>right now in fighting because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone use exemptions and it's a </v>

754
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 1>very controversial subject with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different opinions on both sides.</v>

755
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And there's fighters that are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and it helps them recover </v>

756
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it definitely is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take it,</v>

758
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:13.961
<v Speaker 1>it'll definitely help you recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the difference between you </v>

759
00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:17.321
<v Speaker 1>taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recovering quicker and a guy who </v>

760
00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 1>might have the same levels as you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take anything.</v>

761
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're training all the time,</v>

762
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:24.630
<v Speaker 1>your body gets beaten down and your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>has naturally low levels because you're </v>

763
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.451
<v Speaker 1>pushing it to the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to get your body to </v>

764
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:28.451
<v Speaker 1>respond.</v>

765
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:28.451
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure you sleep 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

766
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:30.120
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to make sure you drink shit,</v>

767
00:34:30.121 --> 00:34:35.121
<v Speaker 1>loads of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to make sure your nutrition is </v>

768
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 1>on point super clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do all those things,</v>

769
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you can maximize your hormone levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

770
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 1>If you're a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy man.</v>

771
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:42.200
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get the right sleep,</v>

772
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're stressed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't eat right,</v>

773
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 1>if you overtrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could easily show low levels.</v>

774
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You go to a doctor and the doctor says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

775
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got low testosterone sunrail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a testosterone use exemption </v>

776
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will be better than ever.</v>

777
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question becomes when is it,</v>

778
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 1>when should it be illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then where do we stop?</v>

779
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a lot of testosterone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a testosterone supplements that you can </v>

780
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 1>take that are natural over the counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

781
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different ingredients </v>
<v Speaker 1>and testosterone boosters that has been </v>

782
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.781
<v Speaker 1>shown to have fairly significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases in your body's ability to </v>

783
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:17.090
<v Speaker 1>produce testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd start with that.</v>

784
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is where does it end?</v>

785
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make testosterone illegal,</v>

786
00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

787
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:25.490
<v Speaker 1>a guy can't take tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you take creatine?</v>

788
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take amino acids.</v>

789
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Can you take vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can he take a bunch of things outside?</v>

790
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they?</v>

791
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

792
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why not?</v>

793
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 1>When things are improving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things are helping,</v>

794
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 1>they're helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's testosterone,</v>

795
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 1>what about vitamin B?</v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

796
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 1>That's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

797
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:49.791
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can you take it in an intramuscular </v>

798
00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:51.771
<v Speaker 1>shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that really increases </v>

799
00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:51.771
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you know?</v>

800
00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

801
00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why should you be able to?</v>

802
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Why should you be able to take vitamin B</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 and you can't take testosterone.</v>

803
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Why should you be able to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone if you can't take some </v>

804
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.501
<v Speaker 1>synthetic thing that someone creates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns you into a fucking super freak </v>

805
00:36:03.501 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real question becomes,</v>

806
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 1>where do we draw the line as far as how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you much.</v>

807
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a point in </v>

808
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.081
<v Speaker 1>time where it's like the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if one point in time when they </v>

809
00:36:15.081 --> 00:36:18.501
<v Speaker 1>first created the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have been able to keep a porn </v>

810
00:36:18.501 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 1>site off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at this point it's a joke.</v>

811
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to stop </v>

812
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 1>people from seeing naked people if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

813
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.230
<v Speaker 1>If they go online and they're curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to find what they're </v>

814
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.711
<v Speaker 1>looking for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to have in just </v>

815
00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 1>everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many options to enhance your body.</v>

816
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be staggering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of a natural athlete </v>

817
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 1>100 years from now is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

818
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's going to be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it in bodybuilding right </v>

819
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:43.610
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

820
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.410
<v Speaker 1>They have guys who do steroids and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have guys who do natural.</v>

821
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have guys who claim to be natural,</v>

822
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of those guys used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do steroids.</v>

823
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they stopped doing steroids and</v>

824
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 1>now they do natural and they've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant benefits because of that.</v>

825
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Like a friend of mine got into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a natural bodybuilder and quotes.</v>

826
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He was actually natural and you got in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big argument with one of those guys,</v>

827
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was fucking huge.</v>

828
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 1>He said the guy was ripped and strike at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and the guy did Roy.</v>

829
00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It's for like a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he's clean and he's like,</v>

830
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 1>so like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

831
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You got all this from steroids.</v>

832
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't look like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

833
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're huge.</v>

834
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.960
<v Speaker 1>That came from steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just figured out how to keep it </v>

835
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.971
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the benefits all came from doing </v>

836
00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:25.971
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

837
00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

838
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess most of those guys may have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>former steroid users.</v>

839
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to study up on.</v>

840
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're dealing with a sport</v>

841
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:39.261
<v Speaker 1>that essentially requires that at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional level in bodybuilding </v>

842
00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:40.860
<v Speaker 1>require steroids at the professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

843
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.410
<v Speaker 1>probably they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 1>they probably do in football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

845
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm maybe basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could get by and football if</v>

846
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you're some sort of Ray Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super athlete type dude,</v>

847
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get by naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

848
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

849
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Your speculation on my part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have zero experience in football,</v>

850
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but I do know some giant dudes who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just naturally giant,</v>

851
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get giant like bodybuilder</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant.</v>

852
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Get that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a natural look.</v>

853
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.560
<v Speaker 1>That's through synthetics only one way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way.</v>

854
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:12.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

855
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I literally don't even think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

856
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to want to look a little fit</v>

857
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.120
<v Speaker 1>will little fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

858
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

859
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I stay away from a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements because I feel like some of </v>

860
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 1>them get me going too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

861
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying any of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

862
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was to take a testosterone,</v>

863
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it would be good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you would have a problem </v>

864
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.651
<v Speaker 3>keeping it together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'd have to start off slow.</v>

865
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'd be good for you and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what's making you a loose cannon</v>

866
00:38:48.421 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 3>and you don't have enough hormones in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your system.</v>

867
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm a loose cannon without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without it.</v>

868
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 3>You're just a loose cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

869
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a loose cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

870
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Holy Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

871
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Some people think I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

872
00:38:58.401 --> 00:38:59.400
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a loose cannon.</v>

873
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I take twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outrage or outburst is not a loose </v>

874
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.411
<v Speaker 3>cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make that happen of manic behavior on </v>

875
00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:11.851
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about recently or </v>

876
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:11.851
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For.</v>

877
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:11.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happened,</v>

878
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 3>but something happened recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only recently.</v>

879
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I.</v>

880
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

881
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.560
<v Speaker 3>it was just I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

882
00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave myself that 72 hours because the </v>

883
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.090
<v Speaker 3>premier of the show was coming out and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew just.</v>

884
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even talking about whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes next regarding that.</v>

885
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:33.511
<v Speaker 3>When you say you gave yourself 72 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going way back to the earlier </v>

886
00:39:33.511 --> 00:39:37.621
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about your hat and </v>

887
00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:37.621
<v Speaker 3>your wacky attire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

888
00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is connected to </v>

889
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

890
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally confused.</v>

891
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure other people are as well,</v>

892
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.110
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think they are for sure they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

893
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 3>If I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not unique in that respect.</v>

894
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:52.290
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is you get wacky </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 72 hours between like a day and </v>

895
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.900
<v Speaker 3>half before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and a half after to sort of promote </v>

896
00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some of that.</v>

897
00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some of that.</v>

898
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say for when I say 72 hours,</v>

899
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about this past Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday and then Monday part of Monday.</v>

900
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to not gloat but kinda like feel </v>

901
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.910
<v Speaker 3>good about it.</v>

902
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Say thank you to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gavi,</v>

903
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.500
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some tears.</v>

904
00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a big moment for me.</v>

905
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:33.991
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what happens after </v>

906
00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to be in another movie.</v>

907
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even a.</v>

908
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 3>my inspiration is not to do the brody </v>
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

909
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 3>He like Woody Allen or the Brody Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

910
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

911
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:50.870
<v Speaker 3>that first and second episode I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough positivity and stress relieving a</v>

912
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:59.080
<v Speaker 3>emotions out of it to where I'm good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda,</v>

913
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I kinda had an outside feeling going in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might happen.</v>

914
00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:08.371
<v Speaker 3>So in my head I gave myself 72 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of it before was,</v>

915
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

916
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:15.541
<v Speaker 3>Thank you to everybody and after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to not have to explain myself.</v>

917
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm brody,</v>

918
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you not laughing?</v>

919
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I get to like stay in the stage onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll get your crowd to come see </v>

920
00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll understand your sense of humor.</v>

921
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:32.761
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a little bit of that and I also </v>

922
00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 3>think maybe creatively in a professional</v>

923
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to have to.</v>

924
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a me,</v>

926
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Wha Wha wha wha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

927
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Speaker 4>What'd you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck did you just say?</v>

928
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:45.450
<v Speaker 4>You said you're not a me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

929
00:41:45.451 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

930
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done 2,500</v>

931
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.330
<v Speaker 4>audience warmups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could I be a meme?</v>

932
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Miga?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

933
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.530
<v Speaker 4>just in every time we have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation that comes back to me,</v>

934
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

935
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I was in that situation.</v>

936
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I know that we could go off to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>deepest,</v>

937
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 4>darkest recesses of space and you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

938
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you I'm not really into </v>
<v Speaker 4>space ever since I was a kid,</v>

939
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 4>baseball was my thing and you'll just </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn it.</v>

940
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 4>Would you say since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this podcast today,</v>

941
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I've been in a good frame of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Positive or listening?</v>

942
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I know I kind of.</v>

943
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to.</v>

944
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never had to explain myself to you.</v>

945
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:28.151
<v Speaker 4>Bringing it back to you again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you never know what you're doing is</v>

946
00:42:28.231 --> 00:42:29.160
<v Speaker 4>you're on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

947
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never felt I had explained myself to </v>

948
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt at times I had to explain myself </v>

949
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 4>to others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people,</v>

950
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:42.100
<v Speaker 4>those people don't understand comics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's relieves stress for me and I </v>

951
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.661
<v Speaker 4>think that relieving of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of carried over to maybe our </v>

952
00:42:46.661 --> 00:42:50.081
<v Speaker 4>relationship here today and other things</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done and our relationship here </v>

953
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:55.691
<v Speaker 4>today is different than our relationship</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the past decade or so that we've </v>

954
00:42:55.691 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 4>known each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel more relaxed and that's not.</v>

955
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 4>That's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're saying.</v>

956
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 4>So you feel like because of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>success,</v>

957
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 4>you've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's alleviated some pressure,</v>

958
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:08.441
<v Speaker 4>you feel more better about the future </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's allowed you and enhanced you in</v>

959
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:09.470
<v Speaker 4>all of your dealings.</v>

960
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.740
<v Speaker 4>Essentially for the 72 hour period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's allowed me to gloat a little bit.</v>

961
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 4>You don't need the glow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I know you're going to say that.</v>

962
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you know?</v>

963
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Because you know me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you.</v>

964
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.090
<v Speaker 4>My path is a little different than </v>
<v Speaker 4>yours.</v>

965
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.420
<v Speaker 4>Your past path is unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian's path is unique.</v>

966
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it unique?</v>

967
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could file Brian home the GPS and</v>

968
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

969
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 4>It's five in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go home.</v>

970
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 4>So for that I gave myself 72 hours to </v>
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

971
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.230
<v Speaker 4>If you talk about 72 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one more time,</v>

972
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 4>we're going to lose everyone listening </v>
<v Speaker 4>to this.</v>

973
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's true.</v>

974
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are people are there enough right</v>

975
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're filled up with 72 hours.</v>

976
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

977
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 4>this guy shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>About a 72 hours.</v>

978
00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just brought up the fact that he </v>

979
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.120
<v Speaker 4>brings it back to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does he do?</v>

980
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.100
<v Speaker 4>He's back to his 72 hours to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say so uncontrolled today.</v>

981
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Thank God you don't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever think about that buddy,</v>

982
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 4>that you've made it this far without </v>
<v Speaker 4>accent mean you've had some warmup gigs,</v>

983
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 4>but not a job job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to show up at a fucking office.</v>

984
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 4>I've been lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asshole.</v>

985
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Did you see this lawsuit that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now?</v>

986
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Where this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

987
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 4>this CEO of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually pretty funny.</v>

988
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.090
<v Speaker 4>The CEO of Archie comics allegedly would</v>
<v Speaker 4>call all the men that worked the office </v>

989
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:29.981
<v Speaker 4>penises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She called everyone penises and she </v>

990
00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.921
<v Speaker 4>would like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would have these rants where she </v>

991
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:32.921
<v Speaker 4>would scream,</v>

992
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 1>penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis,</v>

993
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.060
<v Speaker 1>penis in the staff meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these guys are suing her.</v>

994
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.730
<v Speaker 1>She's being sued for gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination and she says that the </v>

995
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:48.081
<v Speaker 1>suit is baseless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't be guilty of gender </v>

996
00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:51.381
<v Speaker 1>discrimination against employees because</v>
<v Speaker 1>white males aren't a protective class.</v>

997
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.830
<v Speaker 1>They aren't a protected class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

998
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.710
<v Speaker 1>She's saying that white males don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve protection,</v>

999
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:04.010
<v Speaker 1>so she might be a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saying that she could just yell out </v>

1000
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 1>sexual discrimination from a position of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power being the CEO of a company,</v>

1001
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 1>terrify her male workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they're white men,</v>

1002
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 1>they can't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is he see thinking,</v>

1003
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:22.971
<v Speaker 1>run a muck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the very problem with stopping </v>

1004
00:45:22.971 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 1>jokes and censorship and all this rape </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture bullshit.</v>

1005
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the very problem unequal thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board.</v>

1006
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Whereas non guilty people are guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she may be doing on purpose</v>

1007
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:34.380
<v Speaker 1>as a joke because it is archie comics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1008
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>you know how many people are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up an archie comic now?</v>

1009
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Brian is probably the best thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever do.</v>

1010
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:42.150
<v Speaker 1>If you want to sell archie comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who buys those fucking things?</v>

1011
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1012
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say that would be brilliant if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case,</v>

1013
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 1>but if it's not the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just another asshole boss.</v>

1014
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a boss of a group of men was </v>

1015
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 1>probably really frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

1016
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:45:55.531 --> 00:46:00.531
<v Speaker 1>especially if any of them are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>average men for Dick heads that don't </v>

1018
00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 1>want to listen to a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a disaster.</v>

1019
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So how does she respond to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking screams at him called </v>

1020
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.770
<v Speaker 1>cosmo penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually kind of brilliant.</v>

1021
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>But this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such ass backwards thinking that</v>

1022
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:16.151
<v Speaker 1>like the demonizing of innocent white </v>
<v Speaker 1>males has gotten to a point,</v>

1023
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:21.261
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to Belabor this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know white males have it easier than </v>

1024
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:21.261
<v Speaker 1>anybody in this society.</v>

1025
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:25.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the fact that anybody thinks </v>

1026
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that they can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she can't be guilty of gender,</v>

1027
00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:31.540
<v Speaker 1>gender discrimination against employees </v>
<v Speaker 1>because white males aren't a protected </v>

1028
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.341
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she's inferring is that white </v>

1029
00:46:34.341 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 1>males have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a surplus,</v>

1030
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you have a like a bunch of like get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble,</v>

1031
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 1>free cars throughout your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that you,</v>

1032
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she can shit on you,</v>

1033
00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 1>ruin your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined your day,</v>

1034
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 1>call you a penis at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever the fuck she wants to do,</v>

1035
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and you have no recourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely brilliant.</v>

1036
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1037
00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 1>there's assholes in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

1038
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.290
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's racists,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's people that hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1042
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.880
<v Speaker 1>But when you have someone who's yelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>out like penis,</v>

1043
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 1>penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis,</v>

1044
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.920

<v Speaker 1>and you don't know unless you're there.</v>

1045
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And I would imagine that these guys went</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their way.</v>

1046
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:21.930
<v Speaker 1>They work at a fucking comics place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

1047
00:47:21.931 --> 00:47:26.931
<v Speaker 1>They have senses of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they went that far out of their way </v>

1048
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 1>to file a fucking lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be a disastrous to work.</v>

1049
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Our sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

1050
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the accusations are extremely damaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>to myself and archie comics.</v>

1051
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Archie comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1052
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 1>stands for high values that are global </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

1053
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate her already.</v>

1054
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I hate anybody who would say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archie comics stands for high values,</v>

1055
00:47:47.311 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>their global values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does that mean?</v>

1056
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 1>There was a nice message because of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>global values.</v>

1057
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:59.610
<v Speaker 1>She is rarely even in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go around the world to promote archie </v>

1058
00:47:59.610 --> 00:47:59.610
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She told the Daily News.</v>

1059
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the employee suit,</v>

1060
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 1>she also invites Hell's angels into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>office to intimidate employees.</v>

1061
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't real.</v>

1062
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 1>This is not off the onion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1063
00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it's all raw story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a real legit website.</v>

<v Speaker 1>location of a handgun and 750 rounds of </v>

1065
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:24.751
<v Speaker 1>ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She believes her late husband kept in </v>

1066
00:48:24.751 --> 00:48:24.751
<v Speaker 1>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like horseshit.</v>

1067
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got a 47 followers on twitter.</v>

1068
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Hala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably all from today,</v>

1069
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Speaker 1>from this raw story in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other CEO,</v>

1070
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:38.221
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're file a suit against her </v>

1071
00:48:38.221 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 1>claiming that she is unstable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupting the company.</v>

1072
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 1>The case was settled with the parties </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to hire a go.</v>

1073
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Between Samuel Levitan to facilitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication between this chick and her</v>

1074
00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1075
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:52.741
<v Speaker 1>earlier this year the go-between filed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit against her claiming that she </v>

1076
00:48:52.741 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 1>had become unhinged and that she needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be removed.</v>

1077
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I love this lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just give her an office full of fucking </v>

1080
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>slumpy like doofus.</v>

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>He dudes that she could fucking scream </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1082
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So you blame the guys for being weak and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not standing up to her.</v>

1083
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a job.</v>

1084
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 1>She's an asshole obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

1085
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1086
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she's really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I worked there and yelled at </v>

1087
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:19.590
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1088
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.170

1089
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even do that.</v>

1090
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 1>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was there,</v>

1091
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:49:25.901 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

1094
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's awesome.</v>

1095
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I would think that it's everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1096
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I would have to be there to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment call,</v>

1097
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds pretty crazy.</v>

1098
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>office to intimidate the employees and </v>

1100
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:47.341
<v Speaker 1>frequently inquires about the location </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a handgun at 750 rounds of </v>

1101
00:49:47.341 --> 00:49:47.341
<v Speaker 1>ammunition.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if she called you a penis,</v>

1107
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 1>inviting to be able to throw things back</v>
<v Speaker 1>at her if she had a sense of humor.</v>

1108
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>But she's the boss man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>everybody's wearing like nice clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to dress like they're in an </v>

1115
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.941
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go in their cubicle or their </v>

1116
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>offices and they get their work done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very like buttoned down,</v>

1117
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 1>controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted environment in most offices.</v>

1181
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.041
<v Speaker 1>life is when you trying to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know if it's going to </v>

1182
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:04.281
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if it's gonna work out </v>

1183
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the most exciting things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying to figure out how to </v>

1184
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.290
<v Speaker 1>make this so because even if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

1185
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 1>but how much confidence do you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

1186
00:53:09.321 --> 00:53:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1187
00:53:10.681 --> 00:53:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you might have real confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't feel like a reality until</v>

1188
00:53:14.581 --> 00:53:16.200
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then you could feel it and see it,</v>

1194
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those early days,</v>

1195
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 1>like the 2013 years ago today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stop and think about it,</v>

1196
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you were a guy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to put it together with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain future and no one knew,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you didn't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1201
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:49.371
<v Speaker 1>but it was this thing where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure it out and make it </v>

1202

<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1203
00:53:49.371 --> 00:53:52.730
<v Speaker 1>That's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's one of the coolest things </v>

1204
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.741
<v Speaker 1>about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can find more of those things </v>

1205
00:53:54.741 --> 00:53:56.781
<v Speaker 1>that you could fit in your life where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really sure if it's gonna </v>

1206
00:53:56.781 --> 00:53:56.781
<v Speaker 1>work out the more of those you could fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the better.</v>

1207
00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like you just gotta you just gotTa</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

1212
00:54:13.361 --> 00:54:14.060
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1213
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small little team.</v>

1214
00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:19.240
<v Speaker 2>That was something when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did the Craig kilborn show,</v>

1215
00:54:19.241 --> 00:54:19.900

<v Speaker 1>Well actually why don't you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>play it then do it when he's not talking</v>

1218

<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 1>You want me to not talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1221
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1222
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:38.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean I took an acting class at Arizona</v>
<v Speaker 2>state because I wasn't around baseball </v>

1223
00:54:38.061 --> 00:54:41.270
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is kind of a jock world and you</v>

1224
00:54:41.271 --> 00:54:42.390
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

1225
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>But then when I had some extra credits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took an acting class.</v>

1226
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People said,</v>

1227
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 2>hey brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're funny.</v>

1228
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I never was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I never went to the Tempe Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never did an open mic.</v>

1230
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just played baseball and went to</v>

1231
00:54:56.311 --> 00:55:01.311
<v Speaker 2>school and I remember I'd be up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>study hall and a couple of football </v>

1232
00:55:01.311 --> 00:55:01.800
<v Speaker 2>players and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey brody,</v>

1233
00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 2>you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should do stand up.</v>

1234
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:08.121
<v Speaker 2>I would make the other like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>volleyball team laugh or the track and </v>

1235
00:55:08.121 --> 00:55:09.440
<v Speaker 2>field we all studied together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

1236
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:14.480
<v Speaker 2>the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I took an acting class so they had </v>

1237
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.750
<v Speaker 2>credits and it was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was supportive.</v>

1238
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:20.751
<v Speaker 2>I went in there and it wasn't jocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was supportive artists and girls and </v>

1239
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:26.270
<v Speaker 2>it felt good and I try to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious but I got laughs and I tried to </v>

1240
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:31.050
<v Speaker 2>be serious and it was busting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing but I liked the feeling.</v>

1241
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.770
<v Speaker 2>And then when I came back to Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get into baseball,</v>

1242
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to be a coach or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

1243
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.860
<v Speaker 2>And I took a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took one of those comedy classes just </v>

1244
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.690
<v Speaker 2>to see if I was into just structure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if I liked it.</v>

1245
00:55:45.691 --> 00:55:50.691
<v Speaker 2>So I was living out in Tarzana and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would drive to ucla every Tuesday or </v>

1246
00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday just to do it two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute spot.</v>

1247
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.540
<v Speaker 2>And I was excited about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1248
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:59.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in me who's teaching the </v>

<v Speaker 2>Pauly shore sister.</v>

1250
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 2>But for me it didn't matter.</v>

1251
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.240
<v Speaker 1>She never even did stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>made me feel like it didn't matter about</v>

1267
00:56:40.061 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 3>my jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it was funny.</v>

1268
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So I got that out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got um,</v>

1269
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I learned to make it visual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did learn some basic stuff about </v>

1270
00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:53.080
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making it visual.</v>

1271
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 3>People told me I was funny between my </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

1272
00:56:56.861 --> 00:57:01.861
<v Speaker 3>My jokes are okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was funny when I got frustrated </v>

1273
00:57:01.861 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 3>with my jokes wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they liked that.</v>

1274
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 3>They liked the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1275
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:11.850
<v Speaker 3>it make it visual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I did my graduating class at </v>

1276
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the o r it was packed and I did it.</v>

1277
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I did pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like a comedian.</v>

1278
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 3>And then I did one open mic out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chatsworth and it was a,</v>

1279
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 3>not a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was desperate.</v>

1280
00:57:22.331 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1281
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:28.381
<v Speaker 3>I went from being liked at the dor at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store and I'm a comedian now.</v>

1282
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 3>And so I went to that open mic and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just,</v>

1283
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I could feel the desperation and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew that this isn't the route I want to</v>

1284
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to learn more about comedy.</v>

1285
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 3>So I took a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comedy class,</v>

1286
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 3>and in that class the instructor told </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1287
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.690
<v Speaker 3>get out of Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was started here.</v>

1288
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Who was that instructor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1289
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Danny Robinson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She owe me always a APA because an </v>

1290
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 3>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just learned about comedy contract.</v>

1291
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:57.200
<v Speaker 3>What comedians make doing a spot around </v>
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>

1292
00:57:57.201 --> 00:57:58.350
<v Speaker 3>He told you to get out of La.</v>

1293
00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to a smaller market.</v>

1295
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go find your voice there.</v>

1296
00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1297
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:08.660
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about having a bad set or so</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

1298
00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It was good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1299
00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I would have agreed with that up until </v>
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>

1300
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.280
<v Speaker 3>This is 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1301
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:20.281
<v Speaker 3>but I would have agreed with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that advice and I've given that </v>

1302
00:58:20.281 --> 00:58:23.971
<v Speaker 3>advice before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's necessary </v>

1303
00:58:23.971 --> 00:58:25.501
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think La has such a strong open mic </v>

1304
00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:28.201
<v Speaker 3>community too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many comedians coming up in </v>

1305
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:28.201
<v Speaker 3>La and there's so many different places </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do standup.</v>

1306
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just as good a place as any</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do to do comedy and I think that </v>

1307
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 3>guy's really the significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>club itself,</v>

1308
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.980
<v Speaker 3>being on stage of the club and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen is not nearly as much as it used to</v>

1309
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:43.981
<v Speaker 3>be with now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's more important now is the </v>

1310
00:58:43.981 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Internet is the fact that library guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>get famous from Philly.</v>

1311
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>They get famous from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get famous from everywhere.</v>

1312
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:53.251
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be in front of a </v>

1313
00:58:53.251 --> 00:58:53.470
<v Speaker 3>specific group of people who can decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not to put you on television.</v>

1314
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 3>You just put your shit up online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>

1315
00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.800
<v Speaker 3>because of phones recording sets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many people's shows are getting </v>

1316
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 3>online to like people are getting to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>the development of material.</v>

1317
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:07.300
<v Speaker 3>If they want to look for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could find,</v>

1318
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cell phone videos of all of us,</v>

1319
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a regular basis almost.</v>

1320
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a weekend at a club,</v>

1321
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.840
<v Speaker 3>you do five shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's going to put a fucking video </v>

1322
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:18.840
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1323
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm glad I went to Seattle.</v>

1324
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:25.381
<v Speaker 3>This is basically pre-internet because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it taught me about the three person </v>

1325
00:59:25.381 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It taught me about the MC,</v>

1326
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 3>the guest host,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opener,</v>

1327
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.510
<v Speaker 3>the closer clearing out the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you sat the audience.</v>

1328
00:59:32.511 --> 00:59:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I worked there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1329
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 3>which would work at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that comedy underground up in </v>

1330
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Seattle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg Club?</v>

1331
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would see,</v>

1332
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:43.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patton Oswald Large Park or</v>

1333
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 1>they had the comedy underground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was another one that was run by </v>

1334
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 1>like a mormon or something like that.</v>

1335
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was uh,</v>

1336
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.510
<v Speaker 3>giggles by Terry Terry Taylor ran that</v>

1337
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:55.360
<v Speaker 1>room and I would do that room is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious or something.</v>

1338
00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Who was the guy who got up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Schimmel and like apologized for </v>

1339
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.750
<v Speaker 1>a set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1340
01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I just know that Terry Taylor is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is or was Mormon.</v>

1341
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1342
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.720
<v Speaker 3>And he ran giggles in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Seattle,</v>

1343
01:00:09.721 --> 01:00:10.800
<v Speaker 3>near the university there.</v>

1344
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>There's this famous story where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>got up in front of Schimmel and like </v>

1345
01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:19.211
<v Speaker 1>apologized for a set before he did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your demos really hilarious but </v>

1346
01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>really dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1347
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>he went up before him was schindler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Slayton not sure which one,</v>

1348
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:29.090
<v Speaker 1>but it was just an outrage through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy community.</v>

1349
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you hired this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why are you apologizing for him?</v>

1350
01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>The people came to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1351
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:39.281
<v Speaker 1>why are you apologizing for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew what he did and you hired them </v>

1352
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.010
<v Speaker 1>and the podium and he apologized for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>

1353
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Brought the guy up</v>

1354
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:45.460
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1355
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy may be dirty and that doesn't </v>

1356
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 3>fit our value system here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the alleged story.</v>

1357
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

1358
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>This is what I had heard known by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were there.</v>

1359
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean they don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a big store that's spread </v>

1360
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and I remember I talked about on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio once and the guy said it didn't </v>

1361
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>censor comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invited me to come down to the club,</v>

1362
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>but I never wound up doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the underground.</v>

1363
01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1364
01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good club.</v>

1365
01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Low ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was one of the greatest things </v>

1381
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.941
<v Speaker 1>about the comedy store's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much emphasis they put into </v>

1382
01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:52.461
<v Speaker 1>developing talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the very few clubs have two </v>

1383
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>nights of open mic nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up if they did that,</v>

1384
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1385
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>they've been fucking up left and right </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of different details,</v>

1386
01:01:57.991 --> 01:02:02.991
<v Speaker 1>but even when they had to open mics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many comedian it's off </v>

1387
01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:08.541
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who drove here from Kansas City </v>

1388
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:08.541
<v Speaker 1>and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a comedian.</v>

1389
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hang out the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those,</v>

1390
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are few and far between.</v>

1391
01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1392
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think guys have made it out of La a </v>

1393
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>lot more over the last 10 years than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd imagine a lot of.</v>

1394
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Started out in La.</v>

1395
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys started their standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>career doing open mics in La and then </v>

1396
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 4>went on to have like legit careers like </v>
<v Speaker 4>already does.</v>

1397
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Ours are started at all in La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a legit standing.</v>

1398
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one guy.</v>

1399
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.030
<v Speaker 4>That's an exception to the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think I know about that man.</v>

1400
01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CAPRA low started.</v>

1401
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 4>There's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of guys who started out in</v>

1402
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:43.770
<v Speaker 4>La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of goddamn clubs,</v>

1403
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:48.771
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about how many fucking clubs or </v>

1404
01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:50.751
<v Speaker 4>just within an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two hours of here is unprecedented </v>

1405
01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Magic Club.</v>

1406
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 4>The improv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedy store,</v>

1407
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 4>the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario club.</v>

1408
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Bray.</v>

1409
01:02:56.111 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 4>A vine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go on and on and on and on.</v>

1410
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.840
<v Speaker 3>It's still hard to get into those clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>House.</v>

1411
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.960
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get into those clubs </v>

1412
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.180
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you got to go maybe two.</v>

1413
01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna say a boise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but go to a Seattle,</v>

1414
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.170
<v Speaker 3>go to a Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even go to a Chicago in those clubs.</v>

1415
01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I think it's easier to get people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's easier to get on stage in </v>

1416
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.421
<v Speaker 3>front of a decent situation as a newer </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian with a crowd in Chicago or </v>

1417
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:32.300
<v Speaker 3>possibly even New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Austin,</v>

1418
01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.960
<v Speaker 3>possibly Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle.</v>

1419
01:03:35.961 --> 01:03:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Denver's getting a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Denver hasn't seen.</v>

1420
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 3>They've had a scene for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1421
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I have a serious scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think there are spots there where </v>

1422
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:44.990
<v Speaker 3>you can play those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1423
01:03:44.991 --> 01:03:45.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1424
01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:50.701
<v Speaker 3>the self promoting rooms and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>build up and get a buzz going and then </v>

1425
01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:53.240
<v Speaker 3>come out and play some more rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was always my thing.</v>

1426
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.730
<v Speaker 4>Philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You definitely can do it that way.</v>

1427
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:59.240
<v Speaker 4>You definitely can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously many people have done that.</v>

1428
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.730
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you have to anymore.</v>

1429
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I think La is not a bad place to do it.</v>

1430
01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I think there are enough diversity in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rooms.</v>

1431
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you got your hipster boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got your blue collar room,</v>

1432
01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:14.030
<v Speaker 3>she's got your tour restrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got your rooms.</v>

1433
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through that and I don't know what.</v>

1434
01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Would it be a blue collar room?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario maybe.</v>

1435
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:23.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1436
01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Saddle wrestling to do comedy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they still do it at the universal?</v>

1437

<v Speaker 4>Depends on the individual obviously,</v>

1460
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 4>but I know when I worked for carwash </v>

<v Speaker 4>Second cousin.</v>

<v Speaker 4>probably don't want to talk about it </v>

1521
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:38.940
<v Speaker 4>because it was brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1522
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 4>thanks for bringing it up on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

1523
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was brought up as well.</v>

1524

<v Speaker 4>I'm just being real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce brought up you.</v>

1525
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 4>I think you were uneasy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an ice house.</v>

1526
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Chronical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

1527
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Why would you bring it up again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I heard Joe talked about gay </v>

1528
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have to make it clear.</v>

1529
01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1530
01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:59.980
<v Speaker 4>why do you have to make that clear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I get hassled for it.</v>

1531
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:04.981
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it goes back to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brody notice going back to him and gay </v>

1532
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:07.040
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1533
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.800
<v Speaker 4>apparently you can have sex with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cousin.</v>

1534
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:10.380
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1535
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.100
<v Speaker 4>EMC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your cousins a transsexual,</v>

1536
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 4>then it's even more legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depends if</v>

1537
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you're telling someone who writes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salon,</v>

1538
01:08:17.811 --> 01:08:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you're in and a few girls that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to their cousins,</v>

1539
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:27.551
<v Speaker 1>but they always use the excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not blood related and they've </v>

1540
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:27.551
<v Speaker 1>all done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1541
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have sex with a relative.</v>

1542
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Just not into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think people have done it </v>

1543
01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Kinda sick.</v>

1544
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see them that often.</v>

1545
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1546
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:43.721
<v Speaker 1>I think incest is a sickening thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's happened to some young </v>

1547
01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:44.930
<v Speaker 1>girls or kids or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1548
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It would have the name thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's a cousin that you really </v>

1549
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a cousin is too close,</v>

1550
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:55.270
<v Speaker 1>but what of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what if that cousin is the perfect </v>

1551
01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>person for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you know it does.</v>

1552
01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what the heart wants what </v>

1553
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it wants.</v>

1554
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Brody and then one good and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

1555
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>How much are you bothered by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

1556
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.990
<v Speaker 1>the main character on homeland has your </v>
<v Speaker 1>name?</v>

1557
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bothered.</v>

1558
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Should I be crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what they call them,</v>

1559
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 1>brody on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1560
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you think of.</v>

1561
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brody's you maybe the guy who wrote it.</v>

1562
01:09:16.471 --> 01:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I saw my name and thought about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1563
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1564
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1565
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>so apparently not only can you have sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your cousin,</v>

1566
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but you can have a kid with your cousin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dangerous.</v>

1567
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My cousin pretty hot.</v>

1568
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Apparently even having sex with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister is not,</v>

1569
01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as dangerous as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a kids with health risks.</v>

1570
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no real health risk posed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1571
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:48.710
<v Speaker 1>by having sex with your cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said percentage with sister,</v>

1572
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not good,</v>

1573
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>but it depends on how much the genes.</v>

1574
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1575
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that your sister and you </v>

1576
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:01.900
<v Speaker 1>come from your mother and your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's already some differences in </v>

1577
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:01.900
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mixture of those.</v>

1578
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Obviously your mother's side's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1579
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but if your parents were cousins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you fucked your sister and had a </v>

1580
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>kid who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1581
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 1>that's dipping into the same pool a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little too much,</v>

1582
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.580
<v Speaker 1>which is probably something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really common back in the day.</v>

1583
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Like especially with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

1584
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 1>pre-internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:26.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with royalty royal people like royal </v>

1586
01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:28.931
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one that's like one of the inside </v>

1587
01:10:28.931 --> 01:10:28.931
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking closed.</v>

1588
01:10:28.931 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Ised their eyes be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that close to each other.</v>

1589
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Look all fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because they're like,</v>

1590
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking in the same genetic pool</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time to have royal blood.</v>

1591
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Royal blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be making sense.</v>

1592
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Why so many of them were fucking insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think about how many crazy </v>

1593
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>things that kings and queens did.</v>

1594
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Not just the power itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they were in bread.</v>

1595
01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have something to do with it.</v>

1596
01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:54.690

<v Speaker 1>I Bet I bet are inbred and a lot of </v>

1597
01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:54.690

<v Speaker 1>you're not even a man.</v>

1602

<v Speaker 1>chance to go fucking crazy after they </v>

1621
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.770

1629
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:17.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a period of adolescence where some </v>

1630
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.581
<v Speaker 1>members of the amish community during </v>
<v Speaker 1>which a youth temporary leaves the </v>

1631
01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>community to experience life in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>

1632
01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Just sucking car.</v>

1633
01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Are they allowed to do that?</v>

1634
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going off,</v>

1635
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:30.420

<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to.</v>

1636
01:12:30.421 --> 01:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And then they decide whether they come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back or they,</v>

1637
01:12:32.321 --> 01:12:33.270
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't come.</v>

1638
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.130
<v Speaker 4>We should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're allowed to go out and have sex.</v>

1639
01:12:36.131 --> 01:12:37.390
<v Speaker 4>These girls is fascinating.</v>

1640
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Something that I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Amish.</v>

1641
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 1>The Amish is a subset of the anabaptist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian movement,</v>

1642
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:47.510
<v Speaker 1>which I think was originally started by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther and a $1,500,</v>

1643
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.520
<v Speaker 1>a fucking amazing podcast by Dan Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history podcast on Martin </v>

1644
01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Luther and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anabaptists and all these people </v>

1645
01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.781
<v Speaker 1>that it was back in the time where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>first learned how to interpret the Bible</v>

1646
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:08.810
<v Speaker 1>and put it in a form that was phonetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a regular person could read it </v>

1647
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.980
<v Speaker 1>because apparently before the 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

1648
01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you really couldn't read the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to learn about it from a priest.</v>

1649
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:17.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you were one of those rare people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that spoke Latin and read Latin,</v>

1650
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.500
<v Speaker 1>then you could read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1651
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.570
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like available to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were like sacred texts.</v>

1652
01:13:23.571 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that you get to a Bible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hotel room,</v>

1653
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1654
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much every hotel room,</v>

1655
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the gideons.</v>

1656
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the old Bill Hicks book about </v>

1657
01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.060
<v Speaker 1>remember to anybody ever seen to Gideon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to capture Gideon.</v>

1658
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.460
<v Speaker 1>He did a bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1659
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like setting a trap and calling the </v>

1660
01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>hotel room doesn't seem to have a Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

1661
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.080
<v Speaker 1>You think you could send someone up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to capture Gideon,</v>

1662
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but back then before Martin Luther </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated the Bible into a phonetic </v>

1663
01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:56.451
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had no idea what the fuck was in </v>

1664
01:13:56.451 --> 01:13:56.451
<v Speaker 1>that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just had to listen to these asshole</v>

1665
01:13:56.451 --> 01:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>priest tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once he did that,</v>

1666
01:13:57.571 --> 01:13:59.220
<v Speaker 1>like they wanted people wanted to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1667
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a huge change of philosophy </v>

1668
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.470
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the whole Christian culture because </v>

1669
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:11.691
<v Speaker 1>people started reading into the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and then there's all these </v>

1670
01:14:11.691 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of it and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know that the sub sect that</v>

1671
01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>amish being was a subsect of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

1672
01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided not to have electricity.</v>

1673
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Like w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that about?</v>

1674
01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably teaches,</v>

1675
01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know want to say family values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really have to rely on each </v>

1676
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:31.660
<v Speaker 2>other and go out there and</v>

1677
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>hunt for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do they hunt though?</v>

1678
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I think cut it up raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they eat.</v>

1679
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1680
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:43.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some of them may hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there are other whole thing </v>

1681
01:14:43.641 --> 01:14:43.641
<v Speaker 1>is farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1753
01:17:53.561 --> 01:17:55.330
<v Speaker 3>In truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some issues.</v>

1754

<v Speaker 3>I had some situations in my life and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to put numbers on things and based </v>

1755
01:18:00.851 --> 01:18:04.960
<v Speaker 3>on these factors and experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought processes,</v>

1756
01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:10.260
<v Speaker 3>we came to the number of a 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I understand what you just said.</v>

1761
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.890
<v Speaker 1>What you just said was a statement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would really work if everybody knew what</v>

1762
01:18:20.891 --> 01:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what we're saying.</v>

01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:27.610
<v Speaker 2>They smell like girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like girls.</v>

1873
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Dave had the treatments and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and you're alone by </v>

1874
01:23:33.161 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1877
01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.100
<v Speaker 2>it's normal to get aroused.</v>

1878
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
<v Speaker 2>And it was interesting and I knew I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>16 hours away time zone from America and</v>

1879
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:56.470

<v Speaker 2>Brazil or Thailand.</v>

1880
01:23:56.471 --> 01:24:01.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole history of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't really pursue it there,</v>

1881
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:04.180
<v Speaker 2>but I thought about it and then maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back on another night.</v>

1882
01:24:04.181 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>people thought I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you said maybe.</v>

1884

<v Speaker 2>Thailand saying maybe I came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm have.</v>

1887
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 2>You're making the story confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1888
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:15.690
<v Speaker 2>well I want one.</v>

1889

<v Speaker 4>I came back another night.</v>

1890
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I said maybe I will come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1891
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.760
<v Speaker 4>the reason why I stopped you want this </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

1892
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean at that point I'll probably three</v>
<v Speaker 4>percent gay and that's based off</v>

1893
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.470
<v Speaker 2>getting picked on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a kid.</v>

1894
01:24:33.471 --> 01:24:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Like brody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk like a girl,</v>

1895

<v Speaker 2>you understand joe growing up in Tarzana</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got picked on a lot.</v>

1896
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 4>You saying that someone can make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>homosexual by if they picked on you </v>

1897
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:45.300
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three percent would be 100.</v>

1898
01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:48.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three percent wouldn't make it a 100.</v>

1899
01:24:48.271 --> 01:24:53.271
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in third grade and there's a </v>

1900
01:24:53.271 --> 01:24:53.400
<v Speaker 2>group of girls or even guys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of a tilted pelvis I walked weird and I </v>

1905
01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.950
<v Speaker 2>got picked on for that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that one of those things I.</v>

1912
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000
<v Speaker 4>it's a power of being bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so being bullied can turn you </v>

1913
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.000
<v Speaker 4>homosexual.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a long time ago.</v>

1964
01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:47.261
<v Speaker 4>It might be confusing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a member of the religious </v>

<v Speaker 4>store and argue with Comedians.</v>

1970
01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:00.200

<v Speaker 4>were like saying,</v>

1973
01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:05.060
<v Speaker 4>shit that's not in there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sit on the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the tension out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like he will separate your bones,</v>

1992
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 4>your muscles from your bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does he start a business?</v>

1993
01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 4>And he probably could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will help them out.</v>

1994
01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.870
<v Speaker 4>We'll promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does this guy a homeless guy?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Regular Dude.</v>

1996
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.460
<v Speaker 4>What does he do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly,</v>

1997
01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.070
<v Speaker 4>but he lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lives in normal life.</v>

1998
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that you have to ask?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you hear guys like a </v>

1999
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a homeless dude probably.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you don't assume that.</v>

2001

<v Speaker 4>together who just likes dressing up as </v>

2002
01:29:23.211 --> 01:29:23.211
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he does.</v>

2003
01:29:23.211 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 4>It was a rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does it for his mother.</v>

2004
01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:26.580
<v Speaker 4>His mother was really religious and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>to honor her,</v>

2005
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 4>he just wants to make people happy.</v>

2006
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.340
<v Speaker 4>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like that.</v>

2007
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2008
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.600
<v Speaker 4>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was going to write a comic book </v>

2009
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:35.600
<v Speaker 4>about the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I would say I would make.</v>

2010
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 4>That is a good angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:39.660
<v Speaker 4>That would be the would be the inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>background story.</v>

2012
01:29:39.661 --> 01:29:42.120

<v Speaker 4>origins on him.</v>

2013
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:44.390

<v Speaker 4>he promised to his mother,</v>

2014
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:49.430
<v Speaker 4>mother over a main religious and little </v>
<v Speaker 4>did he realize that as he was dressing </v>

2015

<v Speaker 4>up like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ type powers,</v>

2016
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 4>he found them because his mother wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>him to dress up like that.</v>

2017
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:55.680

01:29:56.961 --> 01:30:00.150
<v Speaker 3>he does have Jesus' light qualities if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to look at it that way.</v>

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it made I made an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2068
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 1>is it a transexual guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2069
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not as close to a guy's made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2070
01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's more a woman as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2071
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:32.460
<v Speaker 1>it looked and felt like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the reality of transexuals did </v>

2072
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>just the cold hard reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just chromosomal.</v>

2073
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:39.630
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as like behavior and </v>

2074
01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:42.520
<v Speaker 1>appearance and maybe even like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sex,</v>

2075
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:47.730
<v Speaker 1>like you might enjoy certain aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex more with the transsexual than you </v>

2076
01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:51.040
<v Speaker 1>would an angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight cigarette smoking woman who's</v>

2077
01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:53.440
<v Speaker 1>got a head like a frying pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2078
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:55.800
<v Speaker 1>if you found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that transgender woman.</v>

2079
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:56.920
<v Speaker 1>This is the picture though.</v>

2080
01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Brody's with Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

2081
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.550
<v Speaker 1>What is the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2082
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 1>You're going to ruin everything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2083
01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is I would rather have a sexual</v>

2084
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:15.151
<v Speaker 1>experience with a transgender that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really sexy and sweet rather than a big </v>

2085
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 1>angry woman that's built like a football</v>
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>

2086
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

2087
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.080
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to have a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

2088
01:33:23.081 --> 01:33:28.081
<v Speaker 1>if you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely want to have a sexual </v>

2089
01:33:28.081 --> 01:33:28.081
<v Speaker 1>experience with something feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2090
01:33:28.081 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And the reality of femininity versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>

2091
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a line where shit gets blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That rhyme.</v>

2092
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:37.780
<v Speaker 1>That line is big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angry Fred flinstone looking women.</v>

2093
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus like Thai lady.</v>

2094
01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually very cute.</v>

2095
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you go when you're in top?</v>

2096
01:33:46.391 --> 01:33:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Urine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking off the screen.</v>

2097
01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Urine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>urine,</v>

2098
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're alone.</v>

2099
01:33:50.711 --> 01:33:53.350
<v Speaker 1>You've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not a Thailand,</v>

2100
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:58.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's only three people on the </v>

2101
01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:58.380
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you,</v>

2102
01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.300
<v Speaker 1>the Thai lady boy and the big Fred </v>
<v Speaker 1>flintstone looking angry.</v>

2103
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be with the Fred </v>
<v Speaker 1>Flintstone or boogers in her notes.</v>

2104
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't beat breath.</v>

2105
01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll let her give me a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her feet smell to transgender,</v>

2106
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 1>irregular curl though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was those two.</v>

2107
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:15.780
<v Speaker 1>You could probably cut a nice young one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks,</v>

2108
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2109
01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:22.620
<v Speaker 1>a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also there's the feeling of </v>

2110
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.330
<v Speaker 1>exploitation that comes with having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2111
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.440
<v Speaker 1>having a sexual experience with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute that's a female that you </v>

2112
01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:28.740
<v Speaker 1>don't get if it's a prostitute that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>

2113
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a female prostitute,</v>

2114
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:35.380
<v Speaker 1>like there's this thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2115
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitution,</v>

2116
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you think that women are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited.</v>

2117
01:34:39.670 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of the main negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of prostitution.</v>

2118
01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And then also as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking,</v>

2119
01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they prostitutes?</v>

2120
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Most likely because they didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good family structure.</v>

2121
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:52.090
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a good father figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that never a good mother,</v>

2122
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>

2123
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Most likely there could be some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just enjoy sex and don't mind </v>

2124
01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>getting paid for it because it's better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than being a waitress.</v>

2125
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you think about a woman,</v>

2126
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.680
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone being sexually manipulated and </v>

2127
01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:13.331
<v Speaker 1>someone being taken advantage of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectified and you think of a bad </v>

2128
01:35:13.331 --> 01:35:18.191
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think about that with a </v>

2129
01:35:18.191 --> 01:35:19.931
<v Speaker 1>guy you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially a guy that used to be a guy </v>

2130
01:35:19.931 --> 01:35:24.671
<v Speaker 1>who used to be a guy and then became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl like and decided to do it because </v>

2131
01:35:24.671 --> 01:35:28.931
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he made the choice wanting to do </v>

2132
01:35:28.931 --> 01:35:28.931
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felt like that's who he is.</v>

2133
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:31.730
<v Speaker 1>He's better than they wanted to be.</v>

2134
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Or did he like made a choice that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely make the choice to have </v>

2135
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:39.641
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you feel it almost like you have to </v>

2136
01:35:39.641 --> 01:35:39.641
<v Speaker 1>get it done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell.</v>

2137
01:35:39.641 --> 01:35:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I could tell you what </v>

2138
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:46.541
<v Speaker 1>they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would assume that they're telling </v>

2139
01:35:46.541 --> 01:35:48.671
<v Speaker 1>the truth and when I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we had bucking Joel on the </v>

2140
01:35:48.671 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 1>podcast who is a transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman to man and you know,</v>

2141
01:35:51.411 --> 01:35:54.920
<v Speaker 1>he says that he's always known inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he should be a man.</v>

2142
01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his personality was always,</v>

2143
01:35:56.770 --> 01:36:01.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only time he was ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy was when he was allowed to be a </v>

2144
01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:03.010
<v Speaker 1>man because this person feel real brody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2145
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I went out from the path here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the from the path here,</v>

2146
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:11.030
<v Speaker 1>because I think what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a very important subject.</v>

2147
01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to define it very clearly.</v>

2148
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2149
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to define this.</v>

2150
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Go Pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pee.</v>

2151
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I come right back?</v>

2152
01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're not gonna.</v>

2153
01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Let you back in this door out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>punching a code.</v>

2154
01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that any one of us can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone what they feel inside their</v>

2155
01:36:28.221 --> 01:36:33.221
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked to way too many people </v>

2156
01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:34.901
<v Speaker 1>that say that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that they should have been a </v>

2157
01:36:34.901 --> 01:36:34.901
<v Speaker 1>man or they know that they should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a woman.</v>

2158
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:37.970
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're saying that I.</v>

2159
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You can't argue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>

2160
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:43.100
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the spectrum of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck ups,</v>

2161
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you know the genetic abnormalities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the variations in color of skin and </v>

2162
01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:55.451
<v Speaker 1>color of hair and the size of teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different variations of human </v>

2163
01:36:55.451 --> 01:36:59.711
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course some people were supposed to </v>

2164
01:36:59.711 --> 01:36:59.711
<v Speaker 1>be boys and didn't come out.</v>

2165
01:36:59.711 --> 01:37:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Boys absolutely no doubt about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think one day they're going to be able </v>

2166
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:09.641
<v Speaker 1>to do something where they give these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people some sort of a genetic </v>

2167
01:37:09.641 --> 01:37:13.211
<v Speaker 1>manipulation and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally turn them into double x </v>

2168
01:37:13.211 --> 01:37:13.370
<v Speaker 1>chromosome women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

2169
01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that's not that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beginning of like the ability</v>

2170
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:20.570
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate the human genome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to change a person's DNA.</v>

2171
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>But until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they have?</v>

2172
01:37:22.641 --> 01:37:23.590
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2173
01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have surgery and they have a </v>

2174
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:28.600
<v Speaker 1>hormonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2175
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:28.600
<v Speaker 1>hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormonal treatments,</v>

2176
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to choose between a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who did that,</v>

2177
01:37:33.230 --> 01:37:38.230
<v Speaker 1>a male born male who did that and became</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really sexy transgender or </v>

2178
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:43.810
<v Speaker 1>disgusting angry woman who hates men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed getting disgusting,</v>

2179
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 1>angry eight women that hates,</v>

2196
01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:31.671
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's three people on the planet.</v>

2197

2201
01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 4>There'll be no impregnated people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those two people are gonna die.</v>

2202
01:38:42.841 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to be a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless they milk my balls for sperm when</v>

2203
01:38:45.991 --> 01:38:48.210

2204
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:53.410
<v Speaker 4>my sperm staying alive,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't see an Adam's apple.</v>

2246
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember the episode of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mantra that we did with a transgender </v>

2247
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:36.421
<v Speaker 4>woman who is beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her name was like vanity or something </v>

2248
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:37.060
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vaguely.</v>

2249
01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Remember that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like really?</v>

2250
01:40:40.121 --> 01:40:44.050
<v Speaker 4>Pretty like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like stunningly beautiful and was born a</v>

2251
01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:47.980
<v Speaker 4>man and we did a segment where the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>got strapped to a table.</v>

2252
01:40:47.981 --> 01:40:51.520
<v Speaker 4>It's called make me hard and we put a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was strapped to a table.</v>

2253
01:40:51.521 --> 01:40:56.521
<v Speaker 4>We put a light box over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick would go off when he got an </v>

2254
01:40:56.521 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 4>erection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so of course we controlled the button so</v>

2255
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:03.751
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like whenever like majors were </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating bananas or we had this </v>

2256
01:41:03.751 --> 01:41:07.860
<v Speaker 4>transgender get out and the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>does a dance for this guy and then she </v>

2257
01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.070
<v Speaker 4>puts a whip cream on her nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys sucks.</v>

2258
01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 4>The whip cream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>offered tests.</v>

2259
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:12.820
<v Speaker 4>She had big fake tits and then she pulls</v>
<v Speaker 4>out a promo.</v>

2260
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I remember that she pulls out a penis at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of this fucking light.</v>

2261
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 4>The light starts flashing pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2262
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2263
01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:18.960
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was saying,</v>

2264
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I remember that her penis looked like </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

2265
01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 4>like a primate penis that had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned.</v>

2266
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Like if you took a champ and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned the champ and he saw his dick </v>

2267
01:41:31.110 --> 01:41:32.230
<v Speaker 4>after he was dying of poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask the question.</v>

2268
01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:37.590
<v Speaker 4>What happens to the penis was just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular looking penis on a beautiful </v>

2269
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:39.330
<v Speaker 4>woman with breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good skin.</v>

2270
01:41:39.331 --> 01:41:40.690
<v Speaker 4>That'd be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hair.</v>

2271
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.430
<v Speaker 4>The penis would be an issue for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to do something with it.</v>

2272
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Like if the deal was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she,</v>

2273
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 4>she's beautiful but she's got a dick and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going to blow you,</v>

2274
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:52.390
<v Speaker 4>but you got to blow her.</v>

2275
01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm out.</v>

2276
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.600

01:42:31.301 --> 01:42:34.540
<v Speaker 4>but I think most of the dancers were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

2296
01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:38.710
<v Speaker 4>were male at birth and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's part of that culture.</v>

2297
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:43.711
<v Speaker 4>Just to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very accepted to see ladyboys all </v>

2298
01:42:43.711 --> 01:42:46.000
<v Speaker 4>around working at starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walking down the street.</v>

2299
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2300
01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:49.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2301
01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a different culture over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it a cultural choice or is it a </v>

2302
01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.910
<v Speaker 4>genetic thing where there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of people that feel like they</v>

2303
01:42:57.911 --> 01:43:02.911
<v Speaker 4>should have been a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something about </v>

2304
01:43:02.911 --> 01:43:02.911
<v Speaker 4>genetics.</v>

2305
01:43:02.911 --> 01:43:04.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if like Asians are the Thai</v>

2306
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:08.890
<v Speaker 4>people are more apt to having that gene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would wonder if there's some stats for</v>

2307
01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:12.760
<v Speaker 4>that as far as like women to men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transgenders like buck,</v>

2308
01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:17.850
<v Speaker 4>buck angel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's some stats that </v>

2309
01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:20.551
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what countries have more </v>

2310
01:43:20.551 --> 01:43:20.900
<v Speaker 4>transgender women to men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If type question.</v>

2311
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if talent is Thailand actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>have more transgender men.</v>

2312
01:43:24.821 --> 01:43:26.920
<v Speaker 4>It's an accepted part of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2313
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I bet you down in Brazil there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's accepted and maybe accepted </v>

2314
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:32.680
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2315
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:34.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

<v Speaker 4>podcast before and we got you up to 12 </v>

2323
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:54.300
<v Speaker 4>percent gay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2326
01:43:55.971 --> 01:44:00.971
<v Speaker 4>we got him up to 12 because there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>something else that he does pr right </v>

<v Speaker 4>extra percentage of being gay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's how he got here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he got bullied into being three.</v>

2331
01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.680

2344
01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they saw two guys making love </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie or whatever and they </v>

2345
01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:22.791
<v Speaker 2>actually felt good about knowing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys loved each other and it may even </v>

2346
01:45:23.670 --> 01:45:28.670
<v Speaker 2>aroused a straight guy knowing that two </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were passionately in love with each</v>

2347
01:45:29.131 --> 01:45:29.490

<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

2350
01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.040
<v Speaker 4>it means you don't have a sense of humor</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you probably weren't there with </v>

2351
01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:43.521
<v Speaker 4>another man who also has a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humor because if you did as soon as jake</v>

01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:43.030
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2409
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to go into detail,</v>

2410
01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:52.850
<v Speaker 2>but I pushed it to the limit as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could go.</v>

2411
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I perform?</v>

2412
01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I will go on record saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

2413
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Never have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to perform oral on a man.</v>

2414
01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Can I go on record saying that?</v>

2415
01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>

2416
01:49:07.071 --> 01:49:10.210
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that didn't happen.</v>

2417
01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What didn't happen also is kissing,</v>

2418
01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.460
<v Speaker 4>kissing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't want to kiss a man.</v>

2419
01:49:18.461 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 4>To be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no kissing,</v>

2420
01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 4>no kissing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no race car driving,</v>

2421
01:49:22.810 --> 01:49:26.000
<v Speaker 4>no meteorite impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many of the things didn't tell you.</v>

2422
01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Make an unromantic I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I apologize.</v>

2423
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:46.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm very romantic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go on and</v>

2424
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you know some stuff I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2425
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 3>touched this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

2426
01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked,</v>

2427
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How close?</v>

2428
01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:02.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2429
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2430
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

2431
01:50:07.190 --> 01:50:08.930
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three feet.</v>

2432
01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half feet from the ass or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

2433
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I looked at the penis as a difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're three feet from the </v>

2434
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a safe judgment time.</v>

2435
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:19.930
<v Speaker 3>You can move left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can move,</v>

2436
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:20.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2437
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Three feet from the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2438
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're basically there.</v>

2439
01:50:25.090 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2440
01:50:25.601 --> 01:50:25.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2441
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Time out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Time out.</v>

2442
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Are you saying three feet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about my face.</v>

2443
01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three feet from his dick or his ass.</v>

2444
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Can I say one thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I say another thing?</v>

2445
01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see whatever you want.</v>

2446
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Never did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nor do I want to take my face and put it</v>

2447
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.040
<v Speaker 3>in the advance ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I go on record saying that now we </v>

2448
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:50.080
<v Speaker 3>know if there was any debate before it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>been squashed.</v>

2449
01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:55.081
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now your turn it around and I'm in </v>

2450
01:50:55.081 --> 01:50:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Bangkok and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2451
01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.550
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam gay,</v>

2452
01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 3>turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me look at it.</v>

2453
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Far Away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far away?</v>

2454
01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Three feet from the deck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:09.710
<v Speaker 1>What's it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard?</v>

2456
01:51:09.711 --> 01:51:12.080
<v Speaker 1>At least I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>

2457
01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2458
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:16.970
<v Speaker 1>It was what you described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't normal.</v>

2459
01:51:16.971 --> 01:51:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Something happened to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been poisoned.</v>

2460
01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some chemical.</v>

2461
01:51:21.231 --> 01:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Start injecting your body with estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume you'd Dick shrivels up.</v>

2462
01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessary anymore and it knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2463
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Just like when you inject your body with</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

2464
01:51:30.561 --> 01:51:33.290
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to have men's levels</v>

2465
01:51:33.291 --> 01:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus those women in bodybuilders,</v>

2466
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's think their clinic extends.</v>

2467
01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you find a dead body </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging for like that's been there for a</v>

2468
01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:44.870
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stretched and different things.</v>

2469
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

2470
01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Deq was soft.</v>

2471
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:52.700
<v Speaker 3>We didn't touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2472
01:51:52.701 --> 01:51:55.280
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you tapped it just to see what it's</v>

2473
01:51:55.281 --> 01:51:59.570
<v Speaker 3>like to say I'm officially touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never touched a man's penis ever.</v>

2474
01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:04.610
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you even know that you're in a </v>

2475
01:52:04.610 --> 01:52:04.610
<v Speaker 1>dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you touch it,</v>

2476
01:52:04.610 --> 01:52:04.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

2477
01:52:04.610 --> 01:52:07.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just touched with no stimulation at all.</v>

2478
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like that thing that you do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lucid dreaming,</v>

2479
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:13.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you like practice lucid dreaming</v>

2480
01:52:13.201 --> 01:52:18.201
<v Speaker 1>is by walking around your house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you get to a door knob or </v>

2481
01:52:18.201 --> 01:52:18.201
<v Speaker 1>doorway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're knocking the doorway.</v>

2482
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Am I dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not dreaming,</v>

2483
01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:23.400
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knock on the door.</v>

2484
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>But if you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand just goes right through and </v>

2485
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>

2486
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you lucid dream.</v>

2487
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:34.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a meditative device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever you see a Dick,</v>

2488
01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.420
<v Speaker 1>you should thump it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>

2489
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2490
01:52:38.690 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I got set up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got set up.</v>

2491
01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:45.730
<v Speaker 3>We all dream about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Knows Dick.</v>

2492
01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2493
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.900
<v Speaker 4>don't want it to why you don't even want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to touch it,</v>

2494
01:52:50.901 --> 01:52:55.901
<v Speaker 4>but you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you did touch her as a doctor with </v>

2495
01:52:55.901 --> 01:52:59.680
<v Speaker 4>touch as a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you get it to officially say </v>

2496
01:52:59.680 --> 01:52:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you do?</v>

2497
01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:04.991
<v Speaker 4>The residency in Miami State,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arizona State.</v>

2498
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.700
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2499
01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please consult.</v>

2500
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 4>There was no kissing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to smell good.</v>

2501
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 4>She smelled it was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2502
01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:19.850
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what point in time.</v>

2503
01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you become a transgender,</v>

2504
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:29.350
<v Speaker 4>when do we decide to call you a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it when you make the choice?</v>

2505
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Because if you still have a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes very.</v>

2506
01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:36.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you have to have your </v>
<v Speaker 4>penis cut off.</v>

2507
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:40.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you have to be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain certain,</v>

2508
01:53:40.431 --> 01:53:41.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2509
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:45.830
<v Speaker 4>medication hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's just for a courtesy.</v>

2510
01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:51.280
<v Speaker 4>It's just the person's choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you decided tomorrow that you </v>

2511
01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 4>want it to be a eustice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this other girl's name.</v>

01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:58.790
<v Speaker 4>What's the girl's name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dub becky.</v>

2518
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I would start calling you out of respect</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of respect.</v>

2519
01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:15.530

<v Speaker 4>But did you know that there's queer?</v>

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:59.800
<v Speaker 4>I feel network and I'm selling queer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're moving closer to the goal of 86 </v>

<v Speaker 4>percent gay by the end of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do it.</v>

01:55:11.481 --> 01:55:14.450
<v Speaker 4>but let me assure you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're ruining everything.</v>

2545
01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.070
<v Speaker 4>We're so close to getting them up to 25 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>

2546
01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:27.530
<v Speaker 4>It's now joe.</v>

2549
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:32.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2550
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five percent moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Task.</v>

2551
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:41.050
<v Speaker 4>This is what I said at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be honest with you at that </v>

2552
01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:41.870
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2553
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:46.871
<v Speaker 4>At the moment where that guy is sucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your Dick happened in person all the </v>

2554
01:55:47.461 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2555
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I think you were 40 percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you?</v>

2556
01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a moment.</v>

2557
01:55:53.290 --> 01:55:57.390
<v Speaker 4>This could mess with my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For that moment when I'm offering you is</v>

2558
01:55:57.391 --> 01:56:00.140
<v Speaker 4>a fluctuating scale of gayness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2559
01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.960
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You brought me all the way up to as high</v>

2560
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 4>as 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you come in a man's mouth,</v>

2561
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:08.340
<v Speaker 4>he's giving you A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm being very generous.</v>

2562
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Very generous by often you were 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>because for most of the population when </v>

2563
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.880
<v Speaker 4>you come in and man's mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit 100 and you.</v>

2564
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2565
01:56:17.281 --> 01:56:19.140
<v Speaker 4>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say if you were in prison,</v>

2566
01:56:19.141 --> 01:56:24.141
<v Speaker 4>you got locked in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brody and I don't plan on going to </v>

2567
01:56:24.141 --> 01:56:24.141
<v Speaker 4>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a nice guy.</v>

2568
01:56:24.141 --> 01:56:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't break any laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I D,</v>

2569
01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:30.630
<v Speaker 4>I defy you to find me like with prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>

2570
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:36.990
<v Speaker 4>because that's the only place we have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>options is sexual part was I had no </v>

2571
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 4>options at night.</v>

2572
01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't go to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brody,</v>

2573
01:56:39.110 --> 01:56:42.170
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a dumb thing to bring up for.</v>

2574
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't go to prison and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they walk upstairs on their own without </v>

2575
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:49.950
<v Speaker 4>a security guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having them shackled risk to anchor you,</v>

2576
01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.960
<v Speaker 4>like pretending they had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they brought me to the mess hall and </v>

2577
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:54.960
<v Speaker 4>then they suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what happened.</v>

2578
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back.</v>

2579
01:56:55.650 --> 01:57:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Go back to me being blow back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that they didn't blow the </v>

2580
01:57:00.650 --> 01:57:04.881
<v Speaker 4>Buzzer and give you your one hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside to play basketball and you wind </v>

2581
01:57:04.881 --> 01:57:05.520
<v Speaker 4>up getting your Dick sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what happened.</v>

2582
01:57:05.521 --> 01:57:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Brody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You made a choice to go up those stairs.</v>

2583
01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:09.760
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're to push.</v>

2584
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe those number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan,</v>

2585
01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:14.400
<v Speaker 4>what do you think when you come in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's mouth?</v>

2586
01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:16.740
<v Speaker 4>What are we up to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think was just say I did that.</v>

2587
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm just assuming he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say definitely 25.</v>

2588
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:21.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't like your numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

2589
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:26.990
<v Speaker 4>That's a shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've never brought that number up to </v>

2590
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:30.291
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot believe that Joe said 40 </v>

2591
01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:30.291
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty percent because I love you.</v>

2592
01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:31.890
<v Speaker 4>I should have said 100 man team and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man's mouth.</v>

2593
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Can I say something almost immediately?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gaze.</v>

2594
01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I say I wasn't in fucking the guy in</v>

2595
01:57:37.101 --> 01:57:38.640

<v Speaker 4>Spit it back into your mouth.</v>

2596
01:57:38.641 --> 01:57:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Brody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is more gay?</v>

2597
01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.380
<v Speaker 4>What is more?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say something to you.</v>

2598
01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

2599
01:57:46.190 --> 01:57:50.280
<v Speaker 4>We'll move on and know what's going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think of 40 percent gay,</v>

2600
01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:55.780
<v Speaker 4>the end of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably think I'm 86 is our goal,</v>

2601
01:57:56.311 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 4>but you're playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I said.</v>

2602
01:57:58.861 --> 01:58:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what.</v>

2603
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:04.260
<v Speaker 4>You have fluctuating scan.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

2605
01:58:05.461 --> 01:58:07.210

<v Speaker 4>you'll be universally protected.</v>

2608
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:14.430
<v Speaker 4>The only people that will despise you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of this are assholes.</v>

2609
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you?</v>

2610
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:17.700
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're perfect sexually.</v>

2611
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:19.560
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You keep your room clean.</v>

2612
01:58:19.561 --> 01:58:24.561
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yes I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give brody Stevens a hard time for </v>

2613
01:58:24.561 --> 01:58:25.230
<v Speaker 4>being an 86 percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Eighty percent.</v>

2614
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:31.790
<v Speaker 4>Right now we're at 40 stops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moment you decide it is the hounds </v>

2615
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.560
<v Speaker 4>and it's down the hatch of a man's </v>
<v Speaker 4>throat.</v>

2616
01:58:34.561 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Probably sacred fucking stubble and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't think that's so bad.</v>

2617
01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 4>If you feel stubble on your balls and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your balls are clean</v>

2618
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.410
<v Speaker 3>shaven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably is a standard guarantee you.</v>

2619
01:58:44.411 --> 01:58:49.411
<v Speaker 3>There's at least 10 comedians that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone down to Brazil and had their penis </v>

2620
01:58:49.411 --> 01:58:53.251
<v Speaker 3>sucked by a transvestite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you try to rationalize what </v>

2621
01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:56.830
<v Speaker 3>you done by comparing yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>acts of others that are also ridiculous,</v>

2622
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:58.860
<v Speaker 3>you get another 10 percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop that.</v>

2623
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 3>So we're now at 35 percent gay or goal </v>
<v Speaker 3>is 86.</v>

2624
01:59:02.801 --> 01:59:05.020
<v Speaker 3>We got at least 20 minutes left this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2625
01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.210
<v Speaker 3>We can do this brody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2626
01:59:07.211 --> 01:59:09.310

<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2627
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:12.470
<v Speaker 3>I would probably come very close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting your goal.</v>

2628
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

2629
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 3>You'd come very close to hitting 86 if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you tried.</v>

2630
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:24.210
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on ecstasy and you with a </v>

2637
01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.911
<v Speaker 3>tires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to figure out these </v>

2638
01:59:41.911 --> 01:59:41.911
<v Speaker 3>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we hit the skid pad.</v>

2639
01:59:41.911 --> 01:59:46.380
<v Speaker 3>That's not what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say and you push it to the </v>

2640
01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:46.380
<v Speaker 3>limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

2641
01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:46.690
<v Speaker 3>What's with the euphemisms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brody,</v>

2642
01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:51.900
<v Speaker 3>let's get real with America because </v>
<v Speaker 3>America loves you and they love you the </v>

2643
01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:51.900
<v Speaker 3>most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You telling the truth?</v>

2644
01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see how far I can go.</v>

2645
01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:57.040
<v Speaker 3>That's 35 percent gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2646
01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

2647
02:00:00.371 --> 02:00:01.510
<v Speaker 3>let's be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2648
02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:06.540
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a 35 percent gay thought </v>

2649
02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:10.321
<v Speaker 3>worth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth where we have only four </v>

2650
02:00:10.321 --> 02:00:13.831
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are we at the moment is what's </v>

2651
02:00:13.831 --> 02:00:13.831
<v Speaker 3>going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's sucking your Dick,</v>

2652
02:00:13.831 --> 02:00:16.540
<v Speaker 3>but is she tickling your balls?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is she probably.</v>

2653
02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Does she know her thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does she know what the fuck she's doing?</v>

2654
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're decent,</v>

2655
02:00:19.691 --> 02:00:22.990
<v Speaker 3>but if you feel like the girls doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you feel like a guy's doing it?</v>

2656
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.760
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about a guy.</v>

2657
02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:27.430
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking about a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks like a girl.</v>

2658
02:00:27.930 --> 02:00:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Make up the hound smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel harassed sexually.</v>

2659
02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Adam know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>

2660
02:00:34.730 --> 02:00:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry about that.</v>

2661
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:42.400
<v Speaker 3>When you release the hounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any feeling of regret?</v>

2662
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any if that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even from what my recollection </v>

2663
02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:50.400
<v Speaker 3>recollection?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2664
02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use stone cold sober.</v>

2665
02:00:53.110 --> 02:00:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I was probably on a hookah and beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we hit 86 percent.</v>

2666
02:00:56.710 --> 02:00:57.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't.</v>

2667
02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:04.580
<v Speaker 3>That's I want to say this jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about whatever you want </v>

2668
02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>regarding this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be honest.</v>

2669
02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It is a subject that does make me </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable for just a couple reasons.</v>

2670
02:01:11.051 --> 02:01:15.130
<v Speaker 3>The other reasons that it is so public </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what I know,</v>

2671
02:01:15.131 --> 02:01:20.131
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to want to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be on comedy central and </v>

2672
02:01:20.131 --> 02:01:20.131
<v Speaker 3>it freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2673
02:01:20.131 --> 02:01:20.530
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brody,</v>

2674
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.040
<v Speaker 3>what you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who you are is who you are and who you </v>

2675
02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:26.040
<v Speaker 3>are as awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love you.</v>

2676
02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I ain't no matter if you're 86 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay or like everybody else in the room </v>

2677
02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:30.900
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matter.</v>

2678
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Let me say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On this podcast you allowed me to kind </v>

2679
02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:39.781
<v Speaker 3>of explain everything about express </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and I and I and I feel like </v>

2680
02:01:39.781 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe on this</v>

2681
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not blaming anybody,</v>

2682
02:01:42.831 --> 02:01:47.831
<v Speaker 4>it can be my own neurosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it comes across that </v>

2683
02:01:47.831 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of how we explained it.</v>

2684
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a TV show and I know this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a podcast,</v>

2685
02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 4>but that's where some of my anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>lies,</v>

2686
02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:01.300
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that we just talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this here does make me feel better and </v>

2687
02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:04.070
<v Speaker 4>knowing that you have my back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter if you're 100 percent gay,</v>

2688
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:09.280
<v Speaker 4>which not a lot of people not on when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you come in the guy's mouth you 100 </v>

2689
02:02:09.381 --> 02:02:14.381
<v Speaker 4>percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have said that I don't </v>

2690
02:02:14.381 --> 02:02:14.381
<v Speaker 4>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't agree with them.</v>

2691
02:02:14.381 --> 02:02:14.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2692
02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:16.700
<v Speaker 4>But your third year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>86 percent.</v>

2693
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I debate you on that.</v>

2694
02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.470
<v Speaker 4>I said 40 before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's because I love you.</v>

2695
02:02:21.471 --> 02:02:23.030
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say 100 percent,</v>

2696
02:02:23.031 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 4>but I do and I love you and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>

2697
02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I think you're 100 percent awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it matters if you're a 10 </v>

2698
02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 4>percent gay or 25 percent gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit and yeah.</v>

2699
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:35.300
<v Speaker 4>You know what lady boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to a gay man,</v>

2700
02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:40.420
<v Speaker 4>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was a dude who looked like don </v>

2701
02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:40.420
<v Speaker 4>barris and he had a full beard and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was sucking your Dick,</v>

2702
02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:44.830
<v Speaker 4>that would be a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>place that God doesn't appreciate.</v>

2703
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 4>God doesn't appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm joking about God made gay people and</v>

2704
02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:53.861
<v Speaker 4>that's the Christian's conundrum that </v>
<v Speaker 4>God made gay people to God made </v>

2705
02:02:53.861 --> 02:02:54.870
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did God made sociopath?</v>

2706
02:02:54.871 --> 02:02:58.730
<v Speaker 4>You believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2707
02:02:59.150 --> 02:03:01.100
<v Speaker 4>This is a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good question to answer.</v>

2708
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I would like to think that science </v>
<v Speaker 4>provides me with a lot of answers to the</v>

2709
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:12.521
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the universe works and I think it </v>

2710
02:03:12.521 --> 02:03:15.011
<v Speaker 4>does for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think science is discovering new </v>

2711
02:03:15.011 --> 02:03:15.011
<v Speaker 4>things every day.</v>

2712
02:03:15.011 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Do I believe religion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely not,</v>

2713
02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.880
<v Speaker 4>but I do leave open the possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there could be some sort of a higher </v>

2714
02:03:21.981 --> 02:03:26.981
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a guy with a </v>

2715
02:03:26.981 --> 02:03:28.430
<v Speaker 4>fucking robe who lives in the clouds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a harp.</v>

2716
02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:33.431
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reason why I don't know is </v>

2717
02:03:33.431 --> 02:03:33.431
<v Speaker 4>because I haven't died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been there.</v>

2718
02:03:33.431 --> 02:03:38.171
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life itself is way crazier than a god </v>

2719
02:03:38.171 --> 02:03:41.420
<v Speaker 4>just life itself safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no god that made the universe.</v>

2720
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:43.970
<v Speaker 4>There's no universal power that controls</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2721
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:48.971
<v Speaker 4>There's no laws that God the universe to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have an ever expanding degree of </v>

2722
02:03:48.971 --> 02:03:50.360
<v Speaker 4>complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's none of that,</v>

2723
02:03:50.361 --> 02:03:53.900
<v Speaker 4>if there's no higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

2724
02:03:53.901 --> 02:03:58.901
<v Speaker 4>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing if there's no one running </v>

2725
02:03:58.901 --> 02:03:59.570
<v Speaker 4>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that this happened.</v>

2726
02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:01.520
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a big bang.</v>

2727
02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:06.700
<v Speaker 4>There was something smaller than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>head of a pin and by some sort of </v>

2728
02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:07.430
<v Speaker 4>reaction that no one can explain.</v>

2729
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:12.430
<v Speaker 4>It exploded and this incredibly dense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny object became everything you see in</v>

2730
02:04:13.311 --> 02:04:16.010
<v Speaker 4>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every particle of matter,</v>

2731
02:04:16.011 --> 02:04:19.190
<v Speaker 4>even the ones we can't even figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dark matter.</v>

2732
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:24.260
<v Speaker 4>All that shit is so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that every fucking galaxy has a</v>

2733
02:04:24.261 --> 02:04:29.261
<v Speaker 4>supermassive black hole inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one half of one percent of the </v>

2734
02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:30.770
<v Speaker 4>mass of the entire galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bigger the black hole,</v>

2735
02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 4>the bigger the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking madness.</v>

2736
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 4>And then the fact that inside every </v>
<v Speaker 4>black hole might be another universe,</v>

2737
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:41.840
<v Speaker 4>supernovas and asteroids and lava and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Komodo dragons and pigeons.</v>

2738
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 4>The world is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mad,</v>

2739
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 4>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad world,</v>

2740
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:52.550
<v Speaker 4>and to think that it's impossible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>there to be a god I think is ridiculous.</v>

2741
02:04:52.831 --> 02:04:56.460
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lava is impossible.</v>

2742
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:59.470
<v Speaker 4>Oceans are impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A rivers impossible.</v>

2743
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Salmon are and possible a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears,</v>

2744
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 4>madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of its craziness.</v>

2745
02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Every single fucking thing on earth is </v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

2746
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:10.770
<v Speaker 4>All of it together is the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

2747
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we're on a podcast and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could broadcast instantly worldwide.</v>

2748
02:05:15.421 --> 02:05:18.810
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we have laptops that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking inch thin and contained,</v>

2749
02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 4>two gigabytes of data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you could buy beer,</v>

2750
02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to fucking go get a wood </v>
<v Speaker 4>barrel together like an asshole,</v>

2751
02:05:25.681 --> 02:05:28.440
<v Speaker 4>like one of those moonshiners shitheads </v>
<v Speaker 4>and brew your own booze.</v>

2752
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:31.050
<v Speaker 4>It's all madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brody Stevens,</v>

2753
02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know if there's a god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell you what,</v>

2754
02:05:33.631 --> 02:05:38.631
<v Speaker 4>that comforts me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you're not one of those </v>

2755
02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:38.631
<v Speaker 4>guys should go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2756
02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:42.711
<v Speaker 4>there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys haven't taken the test or </v>

2757
02:05:42.711 --> 02:05:42.711
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

2758
02:05:42.711 --> 02:05:43.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe there's an higher.</v>

2759
02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:46.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a higher bain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

2760
02:05:46.471 --> 02:05:49.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm into prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe and blast.</v>

2761
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into the whole religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to think of more spiritual,</v>

2762
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:56.040
<v Speaker 4>but basically like a chick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're selling a chicken.</v>

2763
02:05:56.041 --> 02:05:57.620
<v Speaker 4>My Yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long?</v>

2764
02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:00.400
<v Speaker 4>What does that make me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety percent gay legend,</v>

2765
02:06:00.401 --> 02:06:02.220
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2766
02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

2767
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:05.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2768
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not afraid to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I feel in Hollywood it,</v>

2769
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:12.030
<v Speaker 4>if it's wrong to say you believe in God.</v>

2770
02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wrong to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say wrong,</v>

2772
02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:18.900
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me personally.</v>

2773
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:23.901
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to be as a broadminded about </v>

2774
02:06:23.901 --> 02:06:28.191
<v Speaker 1>this as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea for me personally </v>

2775
02:06:28.191 --> 02:06:30.480
<v Speaker 1>to believe in anything that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally explain and see the work.</v>

2776
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Like when I don't understand quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

2777
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried.</v>

2778
02:06:34.591 --> 02:06:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I've read a few books on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched many documentaries on it.</v>

2779
02:06:37.891 --> 02:06:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I've had quantum physicists on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

2780
02:06:40.231 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>We had a [inaudible] Swami who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum theorists.</v>

2781
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:46.860
<v Speaker 1>We had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked his mystical wizardry to us.</v>

2782
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily understand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2783
02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and so when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in quantum physics?</v>

2784
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they.</v>

2785
02:06:55.230 --> 02:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what they're saying and </v>

2786
02:07:00.230 --> 02:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>universally amongst them they agree.</v>

2787
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Uncertain principles amongst all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physicists,</v>

2788
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>but me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2789
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't know enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck is going on.</v>

2790
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I trust them for sure that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth.</v>

2791
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a whole group of liars </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose making Shit Up.</v>

2792
02:07:17.221 --> 02:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I say,</v>

2793
02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>when you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe I grew up?</v>

2794
02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2795
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the same way I feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is the same way I feel about </v>

2796
02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>the idea of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2797
02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2798
02:07:30.171 --> 02:07:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2799
02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And less so that then quantum physics so</v>

2800
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are assuming that you seem to </v>

2801
02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:41.140
<v Speaker 1>say no to religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's created by man.</v>

2802
02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:43.630
<v Speaker 1>There's make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's approvable.</v>

2803
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>We can show the lineage of religion.</v>

2804
02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 1>We can show the new testament being </v>
<v Speaker 1>created by Constantine and all these </v>

2805
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.940
<v Speaker 1>bishops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven that there were certain</v>

2806
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>pieces of work but of religious work </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was left out of that.</v>

2807
02:07:56.951 --> 02:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>They've made decisions as to what to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Bible,</v>

2808
02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:04.830
<v Speaker 1>what to leave out of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown that there's been a </v>

2809
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:06.580
<v Speaker 1>metamorphosis of the Christian religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the jump.</v>

2810
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:11.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original ancient Hebrew Bible and the </v>

2811
02:08:12.190 --> 02:08:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the oldest version of the Bible</v>

2812
02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:18.901
<v Speaker 1>by like a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the only one that was </v>

2813
02:08:18.901 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 1>written in Aramaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the ancient Hebrew version</v>

2814
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:24.100
<v Speaker 1>of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the translations from ancient</v>

2815
02:08:24.101 --> 02:08:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew to Latin and Greek into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2816
02:08:27.671 --> 02:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different things going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2817
02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.910
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different things going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on when you talk about like religion,</v>

2818
02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:36.490
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about is what man </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote down.</v>

2819
02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean there's no</v>

2820
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:43.591
<v Speaker 1>god and I don't think you can ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the universe is so vast and </v>

2821
02:08:43.961 --> 02:08:46.960
<v Speaker 1>puzzling that to really decide that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2822
02:08:46.961 --> 02:08:51.670
<v Speaker 1>how it all started and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how what's going on behind the scenes.</v>

2823
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2824
02:08:53.981 --> 02:08:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think our idea of a god is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person with superpowers.</v>

2825
02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's impossible that </v>

2826
02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.310
<v Speaker 1>there might be some godlike quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's running the show.</v>

2827
02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:10.120
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be some fucking pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear laws to this place.</v>

2828
02:09:10.450 --> 02:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>There also seems to be some weird codes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you find in things like the </v>

2829
02:09:15.450 --> 02:09:19.711
<v Speaker 1>FIBONACCI sequence is that the fibonacci</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequences of mathematical sequence that </v>

2830
02:09:19.811 --> 02:09:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you find in sunflowers and pine cones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the shape of a person's face.</v>

2831
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.760
<v Speaker 1>And the FIBONACCI sequence is also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was used in a tool song.</v>

2832
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the fucking song.</v>

2833
02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me pull it up because it's amazing.</v>

2834
02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maynard maynard is just a bad </v>

2835
02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.240
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just such an interesting creative.</v>

2836
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Have you met him or Adam of the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2837
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of times.</v>

2838
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2839
02:09:47.321 --> 02:09:49.900
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lateralis a l,</v>

2840
02:09:49.901 --> 02:09:52.840
<v Speaker 1>a t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e r a l u s,</v>

2841
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>but he used the FIBONACCI sequence to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to make this song.</v>

2842
02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>The FIBONACCI sequence is it's like zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one and then two and then three</v>

2843
02:10:06.521 --> 02:10:11.521
<v Speaker 1>and then two plus three is five and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>five plus three is eight and it's this </v>

2844
02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:15.211
<v Speaker 1>exponentially expanding series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and the idea is that this,</v>

2845
02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>this coding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2846
02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:18.940
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2847
02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>the golden section of the golden string </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it were as it's described,</v>

2848
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>is like the secret to life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That life itself is this weird fractal </v>

2849
02:10:29.681 --> 02:10:34.681
<v Speaker 1>mathematical proposition and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it in all these different things </v>

2850
02:10:34.681 --> 02:10:38.561
<v Speaker 1>like the nautilus shells and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different various fruits and vegetables </v>

2851
02:10:38.561 --> 02:10:42.401
<v Speaker 1>that have these bizarre shapes to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this is all the fibonacci </v>

2852
02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:42.401
<v Speaker 1>sequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>

2853
02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:47.140
<v Speaker 1>The actual underlying code of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and that the fact that these </v>

2854
02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:52.031
<v Speaker 1>items are not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that these things like </v>

2855
02:10:52.031 --> 02:10:54.940
<v Speaker 1>sunflower seeds are all governed by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical program almost shows that </v>

2856
02:10:55.311 --> 02:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes that we can't quite describe.</v>

2857
02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:04.090
<v Speaker 1>And in fact there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A quantum physicist that came up with </v>

2858
02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:06.830
<v Speaker 1>this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that life itself,</v>

2859
02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

2860
02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>the lowest measurable levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe itself in the theories,</v>

2861
02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:15.170
<v Speaker 1>these quantum theories that these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are creating,</v>

2862
02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.110
<v Speaker 1>they're finding self-correcting computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

2863
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:23.410
<v Speaker 1>a very specific type of computer code </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was created in the 19 thirties by </v>

2864
02:11:23.410 --> 02:11:27.311
<v Speaker 1>human beings and people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as the possibility by seeing all this</v>

2865
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:34.541
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that reality itself is </v>

2866
02:11:34.541 --> 02:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>an artificial creation that we're living</v>
<v Speaker 1>in</v>

2867
02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:39.490
<v Speaker 4>and I've heard that it seems like it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be possible.</v>

2868
02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:44.700
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen that this is just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dream or this is a figment of </v>

2869
02:11:47.651 --> 02:11:49.660
<v Speaker 4>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2870
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:50.860
<v Speaker 4>there is no reality.</v>

2871
02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was discussed in the concepts </v>

2872
02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.720
<v Speaker 1>like people have tried to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is reality.</v>

2873
02:11:57.721 --> 02:11:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2874
02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.290
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that freaks me out,</v>

2875
02:12:00.291 --> 02:12:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is just basic for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like looking up into the stars</v>

2876
02:12:03.861 --> 02:12:06.140
<v Speaker 4>in the sky and go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes on forever.</v>

2877
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Where does it stop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever stop and think how many </v>

2878
02:12:11.170 --> 02:12:11.170
<v Speaker 4>dicks are out there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2879
02:12:11.170 --> 02:12:13.370
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into that.</v>

2880
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:16.160
<v Speaker 4>How long did you last when the guy was </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking you off?</v>

2881
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an important point.</v>

2882
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Sending less than six days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

2883
02:12:22.650 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a you up at 100 percent.</v>

2884
02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Good at 89 minutes now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 six is what it is.</v>

2885
02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:31.290
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you last though this ADC.</v>

2886
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:36.370
<v Speaker 4>How long did you last?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to set me up for another </v>

2887
02:12:36.370 --> 02:12:37.880
<v Speaker 4>percentage point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't keep track of that.</v>

2888
02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:41.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't last long anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you were a bit intoxicated.</v>

2889
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:44.360
<v Speaker 4>You were drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was drunk off diet coke.</v>

2890
02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:49.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said you had a couple of beers or </v>

2891
02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:49.410
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they serve beers.</v>

2892
02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:49.410
<v Speaker 4>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these top ones.</v>

2893
02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:51.110
<v Speaker 4>You gotta make your fucking stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Straight power.</v>

2894
02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 4>What do you want me to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drunk.</v>

2895
02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You were saying you were drinking beer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might've had a beer.</v>

2896
02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Two downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many beers too?</v>

2897
02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're asking?</v>

2898
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:01.000
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2899
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:04.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm just wondering whether when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk I can't come.</v>

2900
02:13:04.070 --> 02:13:05.720
<v Speaker 4>It takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick doesn't get hard.</v>

2901
02:13:05.721 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got so excited,</v>

2902
02:13:07.491 --> 02:13:10.130
<v Speaker 4>even though you were drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might have to kick you up.</v>

2903
02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:15.140
<v Speaker 4>The 92 percent guy I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a choice.</v>

2904
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:20.441
<v Speaker 4>I followed it and I was pleased with </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I did.</v>

2905
02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:25.660
<v Speaker 4>What were you pleased the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of ejaculate with?</v>

2906
02:13:25.661 --> 02:13:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Do I have to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I going to have.</v>

2907
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.190
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

2908
02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said you were pleased by the result.</v>

2909
02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.310
<v Speaker 4>When I a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to look at it.</v>

2910
02:13:33.110 --> 02:13:35.220
<v Speaker 4>If I have like a big fucking load that </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out of me,</v>

2911
02:13:35.221 --> 02:13:40.221
<v Speaker 4>I'm impressing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he look like a squirrel with an </v>

2912
02:13:40.221 --> 02:13:40.221
<v Speaker 4>acorn after he was done with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2913
02:13:40.221 --> 02:13:40.920
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get impressed when I see my boogers.</v>

2914
02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 4>If I blow my nose and it's a big fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>water snot and a tissue,</v>

2915
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I get excited because you're cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff out.</v>

2916
02:13:47.251 --> 02:13:49.350
<v Speaker 4>I liked when I pick it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though you're not supposed to.</v>

2917
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Why are you not supposed to pick your </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose?</v>

2918
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Because it's bad for your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You turbinates and flame.</v>

2919
02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:58.540
<v Speaker 4>It can cause sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just do that because deviated </v>

2920
02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Septum by picking your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your nose is very sensitive.</v>

2921
02:14:01.351 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 4>It's you're not supposed to be digging </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

2922
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I pull hair.</v>

2923
02:14:03.450 --> 02:14:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they get ingrown hairs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they grow back.</v>

2924
02:14:05.881 --> 02:14:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Or then if you could have nose trimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fuck.</v>

2925
02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 4>That's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science.</v>

2926
02:14:09.001 --> 02:14:11.240
<v Speaker 4>They figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neil degrasse Tyson invented it.</v>

2927
02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly?</v>

2928
02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:15.000
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had to come out his nose.</v>

2929
02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much I,</v>

2930
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.000
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a condom.</v>

2931
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good move.</v>

2932
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:22.860
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you get the super aids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably,</v>

2933
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:23.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

2934
02:14:23.751 --> 02:14:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to get reckon I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wreck it.</v>

2935
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:30.621
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll take the Tarzana hat off and </v>

2936
02:14:30.621 --> 02:14:30.621
<v Speaker 4>you're all set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

2937
02:14:30.621 --> 02:14:31.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be your move.</v>

2938
02:14:31.681 --> 02:14:36.681
<v Speaker 4>Like Larry the cable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he doesn't have that fucking shirt </v>

2939
02:14:36.681 --> 02:14:36.681
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's going to know who he is.</v>

2940
02:14:36.681 --> 02:14:40.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a very clever move on his hat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wear a baseball hat and wear a shirt </v>

2941
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.290
<v Speaker 4>that way when he's not.</v>

2942
02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:41.740
<v Speaker 4>When he wants to dress up and go to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>

2943
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Already know what he looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A regular fucking redneck slides right </v>

2944
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:47.460
<v Speaker 4>into the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'll go on.</v>

2945
02:14:47.461 --> 02:14:51.660
<v Speaker 4>How much did you come just happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it says,</v>

2946
02:14:51.661 --> 02:14:53.640

<v Speaker 4>the way I'm asking you,</v>

2947
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:54.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct me.</v>

2948

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2951
02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I pushed it and it was a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it was good.</v>

2952
02:15:08.971 --> 02:15:09.900
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2953
02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I did it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a class kinison.</v>

3011
02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking classic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the greatest Sam kinison on,</v>

3012
02:17:24.730 --> 02:17:26.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

3016
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Kinison was the kindness center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a groundbreaker and I'm a dice </v>

3017
02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 4>fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Kennedy was the groundbreaking,</v>

3018
02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:43.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kensington became kinison.</v>

3019
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:46.330
<v Speaker 4>His book is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My brother Sam is a book.</v>

3020
02:17:46.350 --> 02:17:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Has his brother wrote about being Sam's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brother and it's like no holds barred </v>

3021
02:17:51.350 --> 02:17:53.380
<v Speaker 4>behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything did come out a few years ago,</v>

3022
02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.470
<v Speaker 4>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I read it in the nine to get it.</v>

3023
02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:56.560
<v Speaker 4>You get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3024
02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:58.060
<v Speaker 4>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got hit by a car.</v>

3025
02:17:58.090 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 4>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3026
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:03.640
<v Speaker 4>He was a young boy and he got hit by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>car and it changed him.</v>

3027
02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 4>When you get hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden,</v>

3028
02:18:05.350 --> 02:18:07.960
<v Speaker 4>different guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as he recovers from it,</v>

3029
02:18:07.961 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 4>they say that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3030
02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read about like,</v>

3031
02:18:10.451 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 4>people wake up and they're different and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually know how to play the piano</v>

3032
02:18:14.831 --> 02:18:18.290
<v Speaker 4>or there was one recently about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>

3033
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.360
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3034
02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:22.330
<v Speaker 4>got a severe concussion and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw playing music.</v>

3035
02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:28.580
<v Speaker 4>He started a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had all this fucking musical talent </v>

3036
02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:28.660
<v Speaker 4>that he never had before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

3037
02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:32.530
<v Speaker 4>teenager credits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>musical talent to head injury was crazy.</v>

3038
02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:34.660
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this happened to a friend of mine.</v>

3039
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 4>Her son was never artistic at all and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a motorcycle accident.</v>

3040
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:40.150
<v Speaker 4>He crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hurt himself pretty bad.</v>

3041
02:18:40.151 --> 02:18:45.151
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had some serious brain injuries </v>

3042
02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:45.151
<v Speaker 4>because of it means fine when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>

3043
02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:47.200
<v Speaker 4>you would never imagined talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems totally.</v>

3044
02:18:47.201 --> 02:18:48.670
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because of that,</v>

3045
02:18:48.671 --> 02:18:52.120
<v Speaker 4>he's like super artistic now and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>never had that before.</v>

3046
02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you should fucking put </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kid in the head.</v>

3047
02:18:55.290 --> 02:18:56.770
<v Speaker 4>They can't draw pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

3048
02:18:57.310 --> 02:19:02.310
<v Speaker 4>But there's something that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes to people when they get head </v>

3049
02:19:02.310 --> 02:19:05.941
<v Speaker 4>injuries and with Kennison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his brother said he just became </v>

3050
02:19:05.941 --> 02:19:05.941
<v Speaker 4>fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

3051
02:19:05.941 --> 02:19:08.200
<v Speaker 4>He's gotta read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta read up on that crate book.</v>

3052
02:19:08.201 --> 02:19:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great.</v>

3053
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if he was still </v>
<v Speaker 4>performing today?</v>

3054
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:13.900
<v Speaker 4>Like where would you see Kennison if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was still performing today?</v>

3055
02:19:13.901 --> 02:19:18.901
<v Speaker 4>Like what would he be at where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what level do you think it will depend </v>

3056
02:19:20.711 --> 02:19:23.440
<v Speaker 4>entirely on whether or not he was clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sober.</v>

3057
02:19:23.550 --> 02:19:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wouldn't even have to be clean </v>

3058
02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:28.550
<v Speaker 4>and sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you would have to straighten</v>

3059
02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:29.720
<v Speaker 1>his act out enough to get his health </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3060
02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Because what happened with Kennison is </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to kinisons first CD,</v>

3061
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:36.740
<v Speaker 1>which is louder than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even an accident.</v>

3062
02:19:36.741 --> 02:19:41.741
<v Speaker 1>That CD was on cassette and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to get louder than hell is in my </v>

3063
02:19:42.411 --> 02:19:47.411
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the all time greatest comedy </v>

3064
02:19:47.411 --> 02:19:47.411
<v Speaker 1>album ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The groundbreaking,</v>

3065
02:19:47.411 --> 02:19:48.350
<v Speaker 1>there had been nobody like Kennison </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

3066
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but when you go from there to have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen me lately,</v>

3067
02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:53.990
<v Speaker 1>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big drop off,</v>

3068
02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:55.640
<v Speaker 1>drop off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop off,</v>

3069
02:19:55.641 --> 02:19:58.430
<v Speaker 1>and then from there to the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3070
02:19:58.431 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 1>It gets worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The further the distance you go,</v>

3071
02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:03.980
<v Speaker 1>because he couldn't keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3072
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can keep up cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night and she fucking vodka and </v>

<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackouts.</v>

3077
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He was going hard man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he used to talk about it too.</v>

3078
02:20:26.721 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 1>He's talk about how he would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had bits about it.</v>

3079
02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:30.920
<v Speaker 1>How do you get to a party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go,</v>

3080
02:20:30.921 --> 02:20:31.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3081

<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

3082
02:20:32.011 --> 02:20:33.950
<v Speaker 1>If you guys do coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd go to a part of it.</v>

3083

<v Speaker 1>Let's put a little line out for they see</v>

<v Speaker 1>and the doesn't have the act itself took</v>

3088
02:20:54.591 --> 02:20:57.340
<v Speaker 1>a back seat to the lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the act,</v>

3089
02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the act itself took a backseat to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

3090
02:20:59.950 --> 02:21:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of comics go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fluctuate like you'll like one </v>

3091
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:08.300
<v Speaker 1>special better and then the next one </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you won't like it all and then the</v>

3092
02:21:08.301 --> 02:21:09.290
<v Speaker 1>next one will be even better.</v>

3093
02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:14.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that I really love but I </v>

3094
02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:16.961
<v Speaker 1>only love like even prior there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his is ones that I don't enjoy as </v>

3095
02:21:16.961 --> 02:21:18.210
<v Speaker 1>much as other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy,</v>

3096
02:21:18.211 --> 02:21:21.530
<v Speaker 1>same way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3097
02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:26.700
<v Speaker 1>they go up and they go down depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much attention they're putting to </v>

3098
02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:30.071
<v Speaker 1>the act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how much other stuff </v>

3099
02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:30.071
<v Speaker 1>they're doing on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in their life.</v>

3100
02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:33.881
<v Speaker 1>But in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennison is the best example for young </v>

3101
02:21:33.881 --> 02:21:34.910
<v Speaker 1>comics or what can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can go from,</v>

3102
02:21:34.911 --> 02:21:39.911
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the greatest of all time with </v>

3103
02:21:39.911 --> 02:21:41.930
<v Speaker 1>louder than hell to being really </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediocre towards his later work.</v>

3104
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Like just no joe.</v>

3105
02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you saying that is like,</v>

3106
02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.540
<v Speaker 3>look at this as what can happen to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want that?</v>

3107
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:53.870
<v Speaker 3>We definitely don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who would be somebody not the </v>

3108
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:56.631
<v Speaker 3>opposite of Sam?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody who kind of turned it around a </v>

3109
02:21:56.631 --> 02:22:01.221
<v Speaker 3>little bit or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or did you turn it around and turned it </v>

3110
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:03.360
<v Speaker 3>down but maintained the level and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved on Louis?</v>

3111
02:22:03.361 --> 02:22:04.560
<v Speaker 3>CK is a good example of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3112
02:22:04.561 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David tells a great exhibit.</v>

3113
02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Tell Dave attell constantly maintains </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

3114
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Dave Chappelle's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another you see Chappelle,</v>

3115
02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Chappelle had that incident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do what was their tour.</v>

3116
02:22:16.741 --> 02:22:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And Hartford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the whole oddball tour.</v>

3117
02:22:18.451 --> 02:22:20.540
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3118
02:22:20.730 --> 02:22:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3119
02:22:22.771 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>that Hartford show was late.</v>

3120
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything was set and they said,</v>

3121
02:22:28.621 --> 02:22:32.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do Hartford on a Thursday?</v>

3122
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Most of the shows are done Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

3123
02:22:35.251 --> 02:22:36.290
<v Speaker 2>and Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

3124
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:40.770
<v Speaker 2>let's do Hartford on a Thursday and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are the shows we did,</v>

3125
02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:42.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dallas,</v>

3126
02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

3127
02:22:45.241 --> 02:22:47.160
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

3128
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big cities.</v>

3129
02:22:48.601 --> 02:22:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Hartford's not really that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

3130
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday night the ticket sales are kind</v>

3131
02:22:56.491 --> 02:23:01.491
<v Speaker 2>of soft and they released a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets so I went on and did my thing on</v>

3132
02:23:02.131 --> 02:23:03.720
<v Speaker 2>the side stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fine.</v>

3133
02:23:03.721 --> 02:23:08.721
<v Speaker 2>I didn't notice any like bad energy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are punks or white trash or </v>

3134
02:23:08.721 --> 02:23:13.671
<v Speaker 2>tough or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had fun and then I went inside to the </v>

3135
02:23:13.671 --> 02:23:16.860
<v Speaker 2>amphitheater and it seemed okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you couldn't hear.</v>

3136
02:23:16.861 --> 02:23:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's maybe 10,000</v>

3137
02:23:19.651 --> 02:23:24.651
<v Speaker 2>people there so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the acoustics were all that great </v>

3138
02:23:24.651 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and the acts weren't having all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much fun based.</v>

3139
02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I think of the acoustics maybe a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of the crowd.</v>

3140
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>And then Dave went on and actually I </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

3141
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:37.641
<v Speaker 2>I kind of right after you went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shuttled back to the hotel which is </v>

3142
02:23:37.641 --> 02:23:39.600
<v Speaker 2>around the corner and then Jeff Ross </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back in.</v>

3143
02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>It was just on twitter that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Dave Chappelle start reading a book</v>

3144
02:23:44.761 --> 02:23:48.180
<v Speaker 2>on stage and had a meltdown and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3145
02:23:48.181 --> 02:23:52.050
<v Speaker 2>it was just sitting there and smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette and caused,</v>

3146
02:23:52.670 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not chaos,</v>

3147
02:23:53.671 --> 02:23:55.620
<v Speaker 2>but they were like booing him or walk it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3148
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:58.080
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that just started the buzz,</v>

3149
02:23:58.081 --> 02:24:03.081
<v Speaker 2>like he had a meltdown and I saw him </v>
<v Speaker 2>that night in the elevator and I'm not </v>

3150
02:24:03.081 --> 02:24:06.051
<v Speaker 2>really friendly with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows my face and he was just </v>

3151
02:24:06.051 --> 02:24:08.541
<v Speaker 2>basically basically still fuming at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience knowing like they,</v>

3152
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>they almost don't know comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was upset with the audience at that </v>

3153
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

3154
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't feel like it was about </v>

3155
02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>audience when you are on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't a battle.</v>

3156
02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My experience,</v>

3157
02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:23.670
<v Speaker 2>my little stage that I would do for </v>
<v Speaker 2>every city,</v>

3158
02:24:24.270 --> 02:24:28.650
<v Speaker 2>it was par for the course up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was our fourth show.</v>

3159
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:30.870
<v Speaker 2>So you think they were saving their </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douchey ness for him?</v>

3160
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3161
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they were saving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that maybe because yeah,</v>

3162
02:24:40.561 --> 02:24:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that maybe that attracted that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd that's going to yell out stuff and</v>

3163
02:24:44.911 --> 02:24:47.880
<v Speaker 2>like prego up Chappelle for good about </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight of the conchords.</v>

3164
02:24:47.881 --> 02:24:49.710
<v Speaker 2>So we're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Thursday night.</v>

3165
02:24:49.711 --> 02:24:51.300
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3166
02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:54.450
<v Speaker 2>women with the flight of the conchords </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on before.</v>

3167
02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always would.</v>

3168
02:24:56.610 --> 02:24:58.890
<v Speaker 2>How long does that go on for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>

3169
02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:02.190
<v Speaker 2>They did very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were solid.</v>

3170
02:25:02.191 --> 02:25:04.770
<v Speaker 2>They would do about 55 minutes.</v>

3171
02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:07.760
<v Speaker 2>They have a very big following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>

3172
02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:10.670
<v Speaker 2>The conch big following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes are awesome.</v>

3173
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.000
<v Speaker 2>They have a very big following and to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were have to chime in there.</v>

3174
02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I love them.</v>

3175
02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:23.781
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love their show to does have anything </v>

3176
02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:23.781
<v Speaker 2>to do with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3177
02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:27.560
<v Speaker 2>But every night they came on and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did their hour and they were solid.</v>

3178
02:25:27.671 --> 02:25:30.670
<v Speaker 2>They kept the couples happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had fans of the show.</v>

3179
02:25:30.671 --> 02:25:35.671
<v Speaker 2>There's monitors everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally you would hear someone who </v>

3180
02:25:35.671 --> 02:25:39.031
<v Speaker 2>were Chappelle once in a while and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people just sat there and they </v>

3181
02:25:39.031 --> 02:25:39.031
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3182
02:25:39.031 --> 02:25:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Chapelle is going to come on an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a set list and then chappelle </v>

3183
02:25:43.291 --> 02:25:45.340
<v Speaker 2>would come on and do his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought it was,</v>

3184
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:46.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a nice.</v>

3185
02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It was good bit of the doing the lineup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having Chappelle closed it.</v>

3186
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird</v>

3187
02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:57.650
<v Speaker 1>though to go on after a musical act like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that as a comedian when the </v>

3188
02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:57.840
<v Speaker 1>musical act goes up and then you go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

3189
02:25:58.690 --> 02:25:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Weird energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3190
02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would end and then the.</v>

3191
02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Then the Dj starts up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get the hip hop going.</v>

3192
02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:11.730
<v Speaker 2>It changes the whole vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a 15 minute switch over 15 </v>

3193
02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:12.270
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3194
02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like goodnight flight of the </v>

3195
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>conchords boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle.</v>

3196
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3197
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I've music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>

3198
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.250
<v Speaker 2>They take the stage off and then the hip</v>
<v Speaker 2>hop guy starts going.</v>

3199
02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:25.690
<v Speaker 2>People were dancing and feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like excited.</v>

3200
02:26:25.691 --> 02:26:30.691
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle's going to come out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe after eight or nine minutes the </v>

3201
02:26:30.691 --> 02:26:33.180
<v Speaker 2>curtain drops and people get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

3202
02:26:33.181 --> 02:26:38.181
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't exactly see the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>city that particular night at Hartford </v>

3203
02:26:39.281 --> 02:26:40.900
<v Speaker 2>that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3204
02:26:41.050 --> 02:26:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3205
02:26:42.881 --> 02:26:47.881
<v Speaker 2>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I either would watch chapelle take the </v>

3206
02:26:47.881 --> 02:26:51.001
<v Speaker 2>stage from the side of the stage or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would watch him from the audience take </v>

3207
02:26:51.671 --> 02:26:53.620
<v Speaker 2>the stage and probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3208
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:56.120
<v Speaker 2>13 out of 16 times I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he's.</v>

3209
02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great example of a guy who hasn't</v>

3210
02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.430
<v Speaker 1>gotten worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got,</v>

3211
02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:02.220
<v Speaker 1>got it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably Bill Burr,</v>

3212
02:27:02.250 --> 02:27:02.970
<v Speaker 1>another example,</v>

3213
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:04.610
<v Speaker 2>bill burrs on the rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

3214
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey got better already movie.</v>

3215
02:27:07.641 --> 02:27:12.641
<v Speaker 2>I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in one of the commercials for that </v>

3216
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Deniro still thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Should be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are guys that are getting </v>

3218
02:27:18.130 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you know,</v>

3219
02:27:18.130 --> 02:27:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Kennison for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the drugs got to him the fame.</v>

3220
02:27:20.001 --> 02:27:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I know he would do that main room and</v>

3221
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.140
<v Speaker 1>it's all the above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3222
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.750
<v Speaker 1>All the above can get to you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything can get to you.</v>

3223
02:27:26.310 --> 02:27:31.310
<v Speaker 1>If anything that takes your focus away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the actual art itself.</v>

3224
02:27:31.601 --> 02:27:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I found that before when I'm too busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my life that my comedy suffered too</v>

3225
02:27:36.131 --> 02:27:41.131
<v Speaker 1>busy with other stuff outside of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My standup suffers and that's the worst </v>

3226
02:27:41.131 --> 02:27:45.721
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't mind if other things I do </v>

3227
02:27:45.721 --> 02:27:47.521
<v Speaker 1>don't work that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I really mind is when stand up </v>

3228
02:27:47.521 --> 02:27:50.591
<v Speaker 1>does not work that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that really drives me fucking </v>

3229
02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:50.591
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3230
02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:51.370
<v Speaker 2>It is different just being off stage for</v>
<v Speaker 2>three to four days.</v>

3231
02:27:51.371 --> 02:27:52.870
<v Speaker 2>You go back up there and it's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3232
02:27:52.871 --> 02:27:54.700
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little different.</v>

3233
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I feel,</v>

3234
02:27:56.110 --> 02:28:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just maybe at the comedy store for </v>

3235
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.110
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

3236
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.810
<v Speaker 2>one of these shows around town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:28:01.811 --> 02:28:03.560
<v Speaker 2>And when you take like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

3238
02:28:03.570 --> 02:28:06.040
<v Speaker 2>all I've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done.</v>

3239
02:28:06.041 --> 02:28:07.250
<v Speaker 2>That isn't a weird.</v>

3240
02:28:07.350 --> 02:28:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like running like you have </v>

3241
02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:12.350
<v Speaker 1>to get in comedy shape,</v>

3242
02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.380
<v Speaker 2>comedy shape and stay there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay there,</v>

3243
02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:17.230
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get out of comedy shake,</v>

3244
02:28:17.231 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>it's carried hard to get back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had that feeling and it's not fun.</v>

3245
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Not Fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3246
02:28:23.531 --> 02:28:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've heard you mentioned a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>how podcasting is like cross training.</v>

3247
02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe podcasting is cross training </v>

3248
02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:36.551
<v Speaker 1>and oddly enough I think that podcasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stand up also help my,</v>

3249
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:41.180
<v Speaker 1>my mma commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3250
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And that made commentary for me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3252
02:28:46.071 --> 02:28:46.360
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3253
02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you and I have had many conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sports because I don't know shit </v>

3254
02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:54.881
<v Speaker 1>about sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a goof when you try to </v>

3255
02:28:54.881 --> 02:28:54.881
<v Speaker 1>explain to me something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

3256
02:28:54.881 --> 02:28:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but MMA is the only sport that I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3257
02:28:57.561 --> 02:29:01.100
<v Speaker 1>really pay attention to and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching every fucking thing I can.</v>

3258
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I watch all the access TV fights with </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller organizations.</v>

3259
02:29:04.941 --> 02:29:09.941
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched probably 15 hours of mma a </v>

3260
02:29:10.971 --> 02:29:15.971
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're watching it as homework or just </v>

3261
02:29:15.971 --> 02:29:15.971
<v Speaker 1>you'd love it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like it.</v>

3262
02:29:15.971 --> 02:29:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I always like it.</v>

3263
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I watched in the background while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

3264
02:29:17.841 --> 02:29:22.841
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I like watching fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always liked watching fights and </v>

3265
02:29:22.841 --> 02:29:22.940
<v Speaker 1>not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3266
02:29:22.941 --> 02:29:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily even for brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched like Jujitsu matches where no </v>

3267
02:29:27.941 --> 02:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>one gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys just tap.</v>

3268
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I like watching technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching guys who know what </v>

3269
02:29:33.730 --> 02:29:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching people overcome specific</v>

3270
02:29:35.931 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an MMA in my opinion,</v>

3271
02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:42.410
<v Speaker 1>is probably the most difficult physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge a person can,</v>

3272
02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:45.470
<v Speaker 1>can attempt to try to be an MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

3273
02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So when I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3274
02:29:47.781 --> 02:29:50.990
<v Speaker 1>if I watch or more ties and other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch a lot of.</v>

3275
02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of kickboxing.</v>

3276
02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever it's on tv,</v>

3277
02:29:54.861 --> 02:29:59.861
<v Speaker 1>I watch like the glory promotions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloria is this new organization that's </v>

3278
02:29:59.861 --> 02:30:01.700
<v Speaker 1>on Spike TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking incredible man,</v>

3279
02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the highest level kickboxers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they're all fighting on spike </v>

3280
02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:07.940
<v Speaker 1>TV and they've got this big organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>called glory.</v>

3281
02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's developing all this new talent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like getting people really</v>

3282
02:30:11.901 --> 02:30:16.901
<v Speaker 1>excited about kickboxing into the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the same way they got excited </v>

3283
02:30:16.901 --> 02:30:16.901
<v Speaker 1>about mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

3284
02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:22.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's that or whether it's </v>

3285
02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:24.820
<v Speaker 1>wrestling or Jujitsu or kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I get out of that is I get out when</v>

3286
02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you watching the best guys in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>

3287
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:34.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's something as </v>

3288
02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:36.311
<v Speaker 1>dangerous as combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a charge out of watching people </v>

3289
02:30:36.311 --> 02:30:38.810
<v Speaker 1>perform and compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find that it's very motivational.</v>

3290
02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's very inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very motivational.</v>

3291
02:30:41.241 --> 02:30:45.630
<v Speaker 1>It gives me energy and you're right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there ringside,</v>

3292
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:48.070
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're obviously in the,</v>

3293
02:30:48.071 --> 02:30:50.890
<v Speaker 1>in the octagon after the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling that.</v>

3294
02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel it,</v>

3295
02:30:51.621 --> 02:30:52.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel it.</v>

3296
02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You hear the slap of the impact of Shins</v>
<v Speaker 1>on heads and you know,</v>

3297
02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:00.140
<v Speaker 1>and thighs and fucking fist to belly.</v>

3298
02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:02.690
<v Speaker 1>You feel all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel the body slams you.</v>

3299
02:31:02.691 --> 02:31:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You'd be feeling on the table like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3300
02:31:04.231 --> 02:31:09.231
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands on the table and when guys get </v>

3301
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:09.231
<v Speaker 1>slammed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom on the mat,</v>

3302
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I literally could feel it in my hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

3303
02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps you have a better empathy for</v>

3304
02:31:17.931 --> 02:31:19.590
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3305
02:31:19.591 --> 02:31:23.520
<v Speaker 1>well I've always had empathy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy or tried to relate.</v>

3306
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:28.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fought in mixed martial arts </v>

3307
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.550
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a lot of taekwondo match.</v>

3308
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a few kickboxing matches,</v>

3309
02:31:30.001 --> 02:31:31.410
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>

3310
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:33.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

3311
02:31:33.331 --> 02:31:37.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of years invested in martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and martial arts competition.</v>

3312
02:31:37.601 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have a sense without doing it,</v>

3313
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:43.590
<v Speaker 1>of what it means to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means a lot to me,</v>

3314
02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of issues with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3315
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with MMA as it stands today,</v>

3316
02:31:51.390 --> 02:31:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging and there's a lot of issues with</v>

3317
02:31:55.310 --> 02:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>the way he fights are scored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual scoring system itself and </v>

3318
02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:00.810
<v Speaker 1>refereeing.</v>

3319
02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And is it something that's fixable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just typical growth of the sport.</v>

3320
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3321
02:32:06.001 --> 02:32:11.001
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely stuff that's fixable and the </v>

3322
02:32:11.001 --> 02:32:13.071
<v Speaker 1>UFC has done its best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they need to update the gloves </v>

3323
02:32:13.071 --> 02:32:13.071
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's too many.</v>

3324
02:32:13.071 --> 02:32:14.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a real problem with guys getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>poked in the eyes.</v>

3325
02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:16.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't like that at all.</v>

3326
02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens too often.</v>

3327
02:32:19.111 --> 02:32:20.670
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3328
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:25.671
<v Speaker 1>there's that old expression doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing over and over again and </v>

3329
02:32:25.671 --> 02:32:26.550
<v Speaker 1>hoping for sanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of insanity.</v>

3330
02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're doing with MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do the same things over and over </v>

3331
02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:34.371
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have these open finger gloves and </v>

3332
02:32:34.371 --> 02:32:35.820
<v Speaker 1>guys keep getting poked and we're having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of detached retinas out.</v>

3333
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are having eye surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Michael Bisping had eye surgery.</v>

3334
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Belcher had eye surgery,</v>

3335
02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:50.480
<v Speaker 1>got quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few guys have had issues with their </v>

3336
02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:52.080
<v Speaker 1>eyes and so that's a fixable problem I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>

3337
02:32:52.090 --> 02:32:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3338
02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:53.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3339
02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Civil Issue Mittens are dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3340
02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually my,</v>

3341
02:32:56.540 --> 02:33:00.450
<v Speaker 1>my idea was to come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it pads the knuckles,</v>

3342
02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:03.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's like a smooth cover over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tip of the fingers,</v>

3343
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:08.610
<v Speaker 1>a smooth cover because in grappling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really grab like this,</v>

3344
02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you grab most of what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grab like this,</v>

3345
02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you look and gene labelle was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing me yesterday the way that he </v>

3346
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.650
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different.</v>

3347
02:33:16.890 --> 02:33:19.050
<v Speaker 1>He likes to squeeze down on all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

3348
02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:22.470
<v Speaker 1>He likes to get his thumb in here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezed down like that because it feels</v>

3349
02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:24.960
<v Speaker 1>like it's harder to break and he might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be right there.</v>

3350
02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case you're okay doing this </v>

3351
02:33:30.430 --> 02:33:34.011
<v Speaker 1>like palm to palm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a deviation in the way you </v>

3352
02:33:34.011 --> 02:33:38.121
<v Speaker 1>have to grapple anyway between straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling with no gloves on an mma </v>

3353
02:33:38.121 --> 02:33:39.930
<v Speaker 1>because of the size of the gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

3354
02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

3355
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They do use gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3356
02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a bear gloves anywhere and kind</v>

3357
02:33:46.081 --> 02:33:51.081
<v Speaker 1>of not in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure they're still doing it in </v>

3358
02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:51.081
<v Speaker 1>other parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3359
02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure in Brazil that was how it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>started out.</v>

3360
02:33:52.681 --> 02:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll start out called they called it </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley Tudo,</v>

3361
02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:59.520
<v Speaker 1>which means anything goes and I'm with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early UFC.</v>

3362
02:33:59.521 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It was bare knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3363
02:34:00.961 --> 02:34:04.770
<v Speaker 1>tank Abbott was the first guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily wear gloves.</v>

3364
02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:08.010
<v Speaker 1>He decided to wear these chuck norris </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves used to buy from century.</v>

3365
02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:10.980
<v Speaker 1>You decide to wear those into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>

3366
02:34:10.981 --> 02:34:15.981
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he was the first guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC to wear gloves and then </v>

3367
02:34:15.981 --> 02:34:16.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] started wearing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

3368
02:34:16.861 --> 02:34:19.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys started wearing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves and then it became mandatory.</v>

3369
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:25.110
<v Speaker 1>But when Vito or fought in the UFC when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 19 years old and a dose in </v>

3370
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC 12,</v>

3371
02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>he wore those gloves and no one else had</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen those fucking gloves before.</v>

3372
02:34:31.390 --> 02:34:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Besides a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abbott,</v>

3373
02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one I think.</v>

3374
02:34:35.170 --> 02:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3375
02:34:35.621 --> 02:34:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it was tank Abbott was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>one who had warned them,</v>

3376
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>so vito or wearing them to a bare </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle fight,</v>

3377
02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>like I know a lot of the guys that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that tournament with him,</v>

3378
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:48.150
<v Speaker 1>they were fighting bare knuckle and came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and because of the padding on the </v>

3379
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>gloves you could really tee off on guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about protecting</v>

3380
02:34:51.161 --> 02:34:51.730
<v Speaker 1>your knuckles.</v>

3381
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to hurt your nose.</v>

3382
02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:54.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3383
02:34:54.861 --> 02:34:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that was the first thing that they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3384
02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.080
<v Speaker 1>the adding of the gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was a good step,</v>

3385
02:35:00.081 --> 02:35:05.081
<v Speaker 1>but I think the next step is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to cover the </v>

3386
02:35:05.081 --> 02:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many guys are getting poked.</v>

3387
02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of the poking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I use the restroom real quick again?</v>

3388
02:35:11.250 --> 02:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use the restroom.</v>

3389
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:14.010
<v Speaker 2>We're going to wrap this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3390
02:35:14.011 --> 02:35:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.</v>

3395
02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.950

<v Speaker 2>I thought it was 12:00</v>

<v Speaker 2>at midnight,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come back though and then </v>

3404
02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:52.450
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me go urinate your preview.</v>

3405
02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

3406
02:35:54.490 --> 02:35:56.780
<v Speaker 8>Never seems like he's doing material at </v>
<v Speaker 8>all.</v>

3407
02:35:56.781 --> 02:35:59.750
<v Speaker 8>He's just yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 8>color Jewish.</v>

3408
02:35:59.751 --> 02:36:02.750
<v Speaker 8>I just get it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is never was about the jokes.</v>

3409
02:36:02.751 --> 02:36:04.640
<v Speaker 8>It was about the in between of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>jokes.</v>

3410
02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:09.730
<v Speaker 8>Why did you not?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He really was so different from </v>

3411
02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:14.621
<v Speaker 8>everybody else doing comedy that we saw.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He used to be strange and it was always </v>

3412
02:36:14.621 --> 02:36:19.061
<v Speaker 8>just funny.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then it just became strange from the </v>

3413
02:36:19.061 --> 02:36:19.061
<v Speaker 8>network.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't do drama.</v>

3414
02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:21.350
<v Speaker 8>I think I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>are you on your medication?</v>

3415
02:36:21.351 --> 02:36:21.980
<v Speaker 8>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

3416
02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.470
<v Speaker 8>Here comes a brand new drama where you </v>
<v Speaker 8>in a mental hospital.</v>

3417
02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:34.190
<v Speaker 8>It's about family are right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you get some jokes,</v>

3418
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:37.700
<v Speaker 8>this is part of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Having your mom tell you that you're not</v>

3419
02:36:37.701 --> 02:36:40.100
<v Speaker 8>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Friendship.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Complete control.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Brody offstage.</v>

3424
02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.250
<v Speaker 8>Onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not much of a difference.</v>

3425
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:55.250
<v Speaker 8>You're going to hang out with brody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He just have to enjoy it.</v>

3426
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:56.540
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pardon the Pun.</v>

3427
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:59.570
<v Speaker 8>If I watch this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm thinking this brody guy</v>

3428
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:01.390
<v Speaker 2>is weird.</v>

3429
02:37:01.430 --> 02:37:02.960
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Brody Stevens.</v>

3430
02:37:02.961 --> 02:37:05.390
<v Speaker 8>Enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Comedy central's verse drama.</v>

3431
02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 8>New episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sundays at midnight and starting </v>

3432
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 8>December first.</v>

3433
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I like how they call it drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>

3434
02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Because it is very documentary style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brody.</v>

3435
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Like they just follow them around pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much and hang out and like edit it </v>

3436
02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:21.250
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3437
02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:21.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was at a drama.</v>

3438
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because there's a lot of drama in </v>

3439
02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

3440
02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just avoiding calling into </v>

3441
02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3442
02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing.</v>

3443
02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.720
<v Speaker 1>They're calling you out our first drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably smart.</v>

3444
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>That avoids the stink of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3445
02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word reality show because of like </v>

3446
02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:39.960
<v Speaker 1>the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3447
02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Ponchos and all this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3448
02:37:41.561 --> 02:37:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bullshitting you,</v>

3449
02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's set up scenarios when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a setup scenario,</v>

3450
02:37:46.511 --> 02:37:48.490
<v Speaker 1>if they're set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any of that.</v>

3451
02:37:49.170 --> 02:37:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can call it the drama.</v>

3452
02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it shouldn't be a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be the actual reality.</v>

3453
02:37:54.970 --> 02:37:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Central's first drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a joke.</v>

3454
02:37:57.851 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a joke.</v>

3455
02:38:00.890 --> 02:38:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also compensate.</v>
