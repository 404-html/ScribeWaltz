30
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a part of it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like I've never seen before in</v>

31
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>the hunting industry.</v>

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Can't be.</v>

43
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Columbia and I would say that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like friendship at first.</v>

44
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>We had a great fucking time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I would always describe that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most fun I've ever had on a </v>

47
00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a good baby ever.</v>

48

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done a lot of stuff.</v>

49
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.823
<v Speaker 1>We were laughing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was like a lot of fun and </v>

50
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it wasn't a hardship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we didn't sleep in tents.</v>

51
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Note we slept at Mike's House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>

52
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And then it was a lot of hiking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and you know,</v>

53
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.393
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't successful until like the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>last days and you shot a moose in the </v>

54
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>celebration was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a good time.</v>

55
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>We had a great sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super hammered the last night.</v>

56
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you drinking?</v>

57
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Like some kind of spiced rum or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind?</v>

58
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got it got real.</v>

59
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.853

<v Speaker 1>drunk in the middle of nowhere and </v>

60
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>there's wolves everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of draw.</v>

61
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.843
<v Speaker 1>Remember we remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that we went and we shot your </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not legal there.</v>

120
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 2>They made it illegal medical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made medical legal.</v>

121
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Then they voted it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking savages go with a male.</v>

122
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.013
<v Speaker 2>They made medical legal and they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispensaries and then they voted the </v>

123
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.694
<v Speaker 2>dispensary's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Bozeman last time I was </v>

124
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:11.941
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

125
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>They were shutting down the doors of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispensary's.</v>

126
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>You're living in the golden land here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

127
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to say this,</v>

128
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably for the best.</v>

129
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Just to keep people like me were in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe space.</v>

130
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just me and you were in the trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

131
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.900

<v Speaker 2>Bozeman is so special.</v>

132
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 2>It's such a cool little town we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be talking about.</v>

133
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be telling people how great </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>get eaten by bears.</v>

137

280
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.413
<v Speaker 1>He's not writing that critique APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you put it on Dora the explorer </v>

281
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you switched it over to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

282
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>He believes this fucking guy dancing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dora.</v>

284
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

285
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.953
<v Speaker 1>I think that I watched like if you watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like game of thrones where </v>

286
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>they're burning children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And like it's entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I need a break.</v>

288
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to watch a man dance around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sing for a woman,</v>

289
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It don't matter.</v>

290
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Those those shows can get dark where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

291
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>like narcos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

293
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And they would just go into a</v>

294
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 2>fucking nightclub and gun people down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sitting there watching like women </v>

295
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:58.024
<v Speaker 2>and children get smoked in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's the other show with Anthony </v>

296
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins on HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

297
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:04.920
<v Speaker 2>The robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

298
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.763
<v Speaker 2>westworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same way they're shooting kids on </v>

299
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 2>there though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kids a robot.</v>

300
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.540
<v Speaker 2>We can just pass that one right in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

301
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.393
<v Speaker 2>Dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every once in a while you need to </v>

302
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>sprinkle a little bit of musical in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

303
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

304
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.843
<v Speaker 2>What is that do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's come coming from a person </v>

305
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>that's been on a bunch of life changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and I know you have,</v>

306
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you about some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

307
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.443
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the one in Nepal where you </v>

308
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 2>almost died and you saw children in </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

309
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.193
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that on the last </v>

310
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably,</v>

311
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 2>it would be worth revisiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

312
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 2>what do you think this is like why?</v>

313
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Why are we so obsessed with life or </v>
<v Speaker 2>death drama that's artificial?</v>

314
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it like in the,</v>

315
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the show Westworld,</v>

316
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>they talk about like it being a game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that being this game of excess,</v>

317
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:50.464
<v Speaker 2>like what can I do in my real life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you watch TV and you watch </v>

318
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 2>murdering and you watched this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this evil thing come to life,</v>

319
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

320
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.243
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is something that you can be </v>

321
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.220
<v Speaker 2>transported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do that in your regular life.</v>

322
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Fruits for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With Westworld,</v>

323
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 2>what you're getting is basically a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>live version that red dead redemption.</v>

324
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

325
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you play that,</v>

326
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this guy got in trouble because they</v>

327
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 2>have all these things in the game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do to people.</v>

328
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.683
<v Speaker 2>And this guy like ty this hook her up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threw her off a cliff and shit and you </v>

329
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 2>can start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want.</v>

330
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 2>But they were filming this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it on youtube.</v>

331
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And then youtube would get mad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube pulled them off.</v>

332
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 2>But then people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

333
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

334
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 2>How come you can just do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did you have that in the game?</v>

335
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 2>But when my dad was my age 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years ago,</v>

336
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.654
<v Speaker 2>there would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would never have ever does nothing </v>

337
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 2>done anything like game of thrones or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Westworld?</v>

338
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Never ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

339
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 2>there was a westworld and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near like it is.</v>

340
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 2>You'll be modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good moving.</v>

341
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think we've just stretched out the</v>

342
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 2>limits to which we're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explore,</v>

343
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 2>like really terrible and evil things for</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

344
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.403
<v Speaker 2>We've definitely changed what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to accept and where the bar is </v>

345
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>in terms of quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bars through the roof,</v>

346
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:13.174
<v Speaker 2>through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's immersive to the point where you </v>

347
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>can't even can't even explain what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing when you're watching</v>

348
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:18.520

352
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.963

<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is like if that was </v>

353
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:35.674
<v Speaker 2>out today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a 100 percent standup </v>

354
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 2>special prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Like,</v>

357
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you tried to put some bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass 19 nineties TV show on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

360
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some nonsense.</v>

361
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if CSI Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even a show?</v>

362
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Is that a real sharp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a CSI Miami.</v>

363
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's several.</v>

364
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.290
<v Speaker 1>There's many CSI I guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'd like to order law and order.</v>

365
00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:11.124
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've expanded our willingness to </v>

366
00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.910
<v Speaker 1>like explore things that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.990
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the best shows ever created in</v>

368
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:23.991
<v Speaker 1>my opinion for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it explores some unthinkable thing.</v>

369
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Awful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awful things.</v>

370
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole show.</v>

371
00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.523
<v Speaker 2>Spoiler alert is around a brother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sister were fucked and had a whole </v>

372
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:32.464
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.090
<v Speaker 1>So it explore these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that in we would never even</v>

375
00:15:37.091 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 1>touch upon in our media in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

376
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.950
<v Speaker 1>the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We be touched upon those things in a way</v>

377
00:15:41.951 --> 00:15:42.570
<v Speaker 1>that we do now.</v>

378
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

379
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law and order's not a bad show.</v>

380
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be entertained.</v>

381
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.860
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

382
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Why do we go not good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

383
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.033
<v Speaker 2>What was it was it was the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they go not good enough or is it </v>

384
00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:05.910
<v Speaker 2>like like porn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch porn,</v>

385
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.013
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you watch some porn from the 19 </v>

386
00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 2>eighties and then you flipped through </v>
<v Speaker 2>like youporn.</v>

387
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Not that I would ever do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you did do that and looked at all</v>

388
00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:14.730
<v Speaker 2>the different categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

389
00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:16.110
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.153
<v Speaker 2>Like why are people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why has gagging something people are </v>

391
00:16:19.741 --> 00:16:22.860
<v Speaker 2>looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an accident</v>

392
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.063
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've expanded our ability to conceive </v>

393
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:26.920
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

394
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.060
<v Speaker 1>In immediate space where we can create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can create dragons that,</v>

395
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that breathe ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can create.</v>

396
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.240
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things you can be transported,</v>

397
00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:35.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

398
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>this isn't real so I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this,</v>

399
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.883
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have this scene of of rape or </v>

400
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.334
<v Speaker 1>infidelity or are incest that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to me only in this fantasy </v>

401
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

402
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I get down on that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch enough of it.</v>

403
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:53.860
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a musical.</v>

404
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I need to be inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That life is grand and that's how I feel</v>

405
00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 1>about them and sometimes it comes across</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like this dude washes musicals,</v>

406
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do for a little bit of a</v>

407
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's wrong with it.</v>

408
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.163
<v Speaker 2>What I'm weirded out about is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural human inclination towards </v>

409
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>progression in everything good or bad is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things just keep ramping up</v>

410
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're progressing with our </v>

411
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:20.420
<v Speaker 1>storylines for like humanity in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in media,</v>

412
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but we're also like suppressing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

413
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to suppress through social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice a lot of the same thing,</v>

414
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:26.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

415
00:17:26.701 --> 00:17:28.950
<v Speaker 2>some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a small,</v>

416
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 2>very vocal minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in reality there's,</v>

417
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.143
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of people find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>about said suppression are upset by it </v>

418
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.583
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck are you talking about </v>

419
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.660
<v Speaker 2>this safe spaces and all this nonsense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people that hear that stuff,</v>

420
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:43.111
<v Speaker 2>we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

421
00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:46.290
<v Speaker 2>this is just nonsense by a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really loud,</v>

422
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.120
<v Speaker 1>devastated even on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something as</v>

423
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 2>serious as hunting is because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing stuff like that's going out into</v>

424
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the world and taking plucking something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't put.</v>

425
00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 2>They're taking it away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the core of what I think you</v>

426
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>do well and what I think others should </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to do is ask why?</v>

427
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.723
<v Speaker 2>Why are we willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is game of thrones the most watched </v>

428
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 2>show that's on right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

429
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

430
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a conversation because it's.</v>

431
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Speaker 2>If it's so fictitious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

432
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It's so obviously fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're living in this fictional world.</v>

433
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 2>You have fictional white walkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have dragons,</v>

434
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.260
<v Speaker 2>he have people that can survive in fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parallels to real life and then these,</v>

435
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.093
<v Speaker 2>these ridiculous fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then these parallels to real life </v>

436
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that that travel along the same path and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't get to choose between the</v>

437
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>dragons and the incest both there at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

438
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it fulfills a lot of like base </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

439
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.470
<v Speaker 2>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this way,</v>

440
00:18:53.471 --> 00:18:55.070
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 2>So like why are superheroes so huge to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

442
00:18:58.951 --> 00:18:59.784
<v Speaker 2>If you stop and think about the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of blockbusters that are superhero </v>

443
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.353
<v Speaker 2>movies that are comic book movies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out like once every couple of </v>

444
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:06.894
<v Speaker 2>months now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy that that was a rare beast when I </v>

445
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.244
<v Speaker 2>was at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

446
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hulk movie.</v>

447
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I would've jumped for joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was no Goddamn Spiderman movie when I</v>

448
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 2>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a TV show and it sucked.</v>

449
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a God damn cartoon TV show,</v>

450
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman does whatever.</v>

451
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Spider spins a web size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catches thieves just like flies couch.</v>

452
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.400
<v Speaker 2>There comes a spider man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

453
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 2>And I used to get up early to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was a huge comic book.</v>

454
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.010
<v Speaker 2>You've watched the Lou Ferrigno Hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

455
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it.</v>

456
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.983

<v Speaker 2>I mean like you watch the Batman Adam </v>

<v Speaker 2>He was like the first movies that.</v>

460
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.480

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of the second in the background doing </v>

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't do anything good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a wooden stick.</v>

464
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.713
<v Speaker 2>He needs to know those shits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman can shoot webs out of his </v>

465
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 2>hands and that wouldn't sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not going to do much.</v>

466
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Then then spiderman sort of changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>

467
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.444
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it used to be able to do like </v>

468
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.883
<v Speaker 2>now he could just basically fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just hurls himself through the </v>

469
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 2>air and sticks to buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

470
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 2>He used to be a little harder to swing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around back because like,</v>

471
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>let me drop my backpack full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbooks,</v>

472
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 2>get to it.</v>

473
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 2>But he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

474
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:23.034
<v Speaker 2>there was no spiderman movies when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and there was a superman movie and </v>

475
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>the superman movie beget the Batman </v>
<v Speaker 2>Movie Batman movie came out.</v>

476
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Michael Keaton was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big success.</v>

477
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>People are shocked at Michael Keaton was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman,</v>

478
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.073
<v Speaker 2>but it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that like Danny Devito was the </v>

479
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:38.214
<v Speaker 2>penguin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got a shot at Batman was one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>

481
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 2>If you were Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be the it guy towards clooney.</v>

482
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 2>George Clooney was Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian Bale's,</v>

483
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Batman Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freeze.</v>

484
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 2>But they got to Ben Affleck and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

485
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>

486
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.544
<v Speaker 2>Like that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of people that will see </v>

487
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.634
<v Speaker 2>you as Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's whether or not they really believe </v>

488
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like Christian Bale.</v>

489
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:03.124
<v Speaker 2>I believe that God could be Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Michael Keaton for a longest time </v>

490
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.420
<v Speaker 2>was Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

491
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started it off.</v>

492
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.533
<v Speaker 2>See that the difference between Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Keaton is there was no one before him </v>

493
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:18.040
<v Speaker 2>other than Bruce Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was the first dark real Batman.</v>

494
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about val kilmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about val kilmer.</v>

495
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Val kilmer was fucking Batman.</v>

496
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Talented human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Val kilmer.</v>

497
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.620
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast at him as a doc holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

498
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of that movie?</v>

499
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Tombstone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tombstone.</v>

500
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the best.</v>

501
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was spooked students ever.</v>

502
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 2>He was believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a.</v>

503
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 2>That was a straight up murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still the most quoted,</v>

504
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.283
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody will think back on Ben Affleck's </v>

505
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>career and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Batman.</v>

506
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that he's done some good </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

507
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also.</v>

508
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 2>He always says there's nothing around </v>
<v Speaker 2>his career that he.</v>

509
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 2>He must feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

510
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 2>if this goes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to ruin me.</v>

511
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:59.290
<v Speaker 2>He's done so many great things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very good actor.</v>

512
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is it about him?</v>

513
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Is he too handsome?</v>

514
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because val kilmer is gorgeous.</v>

515
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>All those folks were very handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gigli him and Jennifer Lopez is that.</v>

516
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a tough time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just say Gigli Gigli.</v>

517
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it was really whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

518
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look.</v>

519
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody should get that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy.</v>

520
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be on your diet.</v>

521
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 2>It's too rich for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people get diabetes,</v>

522
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to lay off the sugar.</v>

523
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got different tolerance cake</v>
<v Speaker 2>every morning.</v>

524
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer Lopez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

525
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 2>besides being beautiful and a body like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a test tube person,</v>

526
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.073
<v Speaker 2>some lab created super freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously she knows how to throw that </v>

527
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows how to throw that thing.</v>

528
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be hard to.</v>

529
00:22:49.211 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 2>It would be hard to argue with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

530
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some Goddamn Nolan.</v>

531
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Pussy Shit.</v>

532
00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.003
<v Speaker 2>Together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not unaware of what you're talking </v>

533
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:00.424
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that those things go so </v>

534
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Speaker 2>hard to go so hard and then they fizzle </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

535
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.700
<v Speaker 2>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what it's like.</v>

536
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like having a like a pinto with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking corvette,</v>

537
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:12.394
<v Speaker 2>Zr one engine stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't stomp on the gas on the highway </v>

538
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.810
<v Speaker 2>and there's no structure to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but listen to design.</v>

539
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Those wheels are not designed for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

540
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Is that why you live in Hollywood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me.</v>

541
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.144
<v Speaker 2>Is that why these Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships always like become huge </v>

542
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and then go away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they do.</v>

543
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Montana.</v>

544
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:33.723
<v Speaker 2>Here's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Alex Rodriguez guy that she's with </v>

545
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 2>super athlete smashes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it seems to be working.</v>

546
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 2>They've been together for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have they been together though?</v>

547
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Months from six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she was with that little bit of the</v>

548
00:23:49.811 --> 00:23:50.644
<v Speaker 2>singer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was at the UFC that one time,</v>

552
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Which one was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the dancer.</v>

553
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.950
<v Speaker 2>That was the dancer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Alex Rodrigues.</v>

559
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at that man.</v>

560
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Super Athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably got a dick.</v>

561
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Like a Goddamn Baseball Bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

562
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.663
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that has that many buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at those top buttons coming </v>

563
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:20.700
<v Speaker 2>down sides of his fist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of that guys.</v>

564
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said two plus $200.</v>

565
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Million contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's.</v>

566
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 2>He's just gotten $400,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our giant hot super athlete.</v>

567
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to smash it together.</v>

568
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:35.354
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that guy knows how to keep it </v>

569
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

570
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy knows he knows how to play when</v>

571
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 2>the ball's coming his way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he smashes that fucking thing.</v>

572
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I think Jennifer Lopez is not tolerating</v>
<v Speaker 2>any losers in her life at this point.</v>

573
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's had a few,</v>

574
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's all I look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

575
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Super Athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big giant Hanson.</v>

577
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big sports fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up when he was just.</v>

578
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.370
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a god,</v>

579
00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 2>a baseball guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to get along together.</v>

580
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Seed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to me.</v>

581
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Just like it made sense with val.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kilmer was Batman tends to me,</v>

582
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.253
<v Speaker 2>but when Ben Affleck was Ben Affleck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how his relationship was </v>

583
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

584
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like it was a tumultuous,</v>

585
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just observing.</v>

586
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.080
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows,</v>

587
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but there's some people where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to have an online vote for this</v>

588
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:21.140
<v Speaker 2>person that definitely the people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you they would not have voted.</v>

589
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe they would have voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Ben Affleck.</v>

590
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I do nonbeliever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem,</v>

591
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 2>like the rock too big for Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

592
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

593
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Rock.</v>

594
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.730
<v Speaker 2>You're wearing a fucking bat suit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wish they could do that.</v>

595
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Speaker 2>They can make it funny and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

596
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 2>are you in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can make it funny,</v>

597
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the rock or the rock?</v>

598
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.470
<v Speaker 2>He could never be superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes his fucking glasses off.</v>

599
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:45.870
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still a giant dude.</v>

600
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.550
<v Speaker 2>The last time doesn't work for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular size,</v>

601
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.563
<v Speaker 2>but that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last guy that was the superman was </v>

602
00:25:53.221 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 2>an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an unknown.</v>

603
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Henry a superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ran out.</v>

604
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 2>They ran out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

605
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.483
<v Speaker 2>the well's dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if they try to make another </v>

606
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 2>hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know enough.</v>

607
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 2>You've had eight hawks.</v>

608
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.460
<v Speaker 2>They're going to keep making them </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

609
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.303
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make 100 more star wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next five years and you're going </v>

610
00:26:06.311 --> 00:26:09.170
<v Speaker 2>to have to sit through like Han Solo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pre,</v>

611
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>pre preschool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Cow.</v>

612
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:12.074
<v Speaker 2>Can they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense because </v>

613
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Harrison Ford was Han Solo when Han Solo</v>
<v Speaker 2>was young.</v>

614
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't just do that.</v>

615
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:18.854
<v Speaker 2>They just came out with the Han Solo </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie to reel back on that because that </v>

616
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:22.710
<v Speaker 2>last one didn't do so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

617
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 2>They need to ask me to ask Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for you.</v>

618
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.560
<v Speaker 2>George Lucas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Lucas.</v>

619
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now bathing and money.</v>

620
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 2>He's flying back in a warm wet money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just forgot to listen to the podcast.</v>

621
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.440
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just gets touched all day.</v>

622
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 2>What was going to be coming out or start</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Adam</v>

623
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.150
<v Speaker 1>to see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

624
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>they're making them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran out of superheroes.</v>

625
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Superman in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's superman in the background.</v>

626
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the DC universe.</v>

627
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.650
<v Speaker 1>There is in back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran up.</v>

628
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.540
<v Speaker 1>He looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

629
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 1>but as long as they don't try to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>him superman.</v>

630
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Is he a bad guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

631
00:26:58.561 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Is he a bad guy or a good guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

632
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of this character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

633
00:27:01.271 --> 00:27:02.104
<v Speaker 1>I've no idea where he fits in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Netflix came out with </v>

634
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Luke cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

635
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an obscure one.</v>

636
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.153
<v Speaker 1>That was a good one though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Black Panther was good at the </v>

637
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:10.561
<v Speaker 1>Black Panthers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

638
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

639
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:12.534
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took so long and we go black panther </v>

640
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 1>movie racist took so long and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant smash hit.</v>

641
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people get it together.</v>

642
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 1>No comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Obrian in the conservative world has</v>

643
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 1>to be careful.</v>

644
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 1>This podcast could sink a ship on pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance.</v>

645
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you come up with a shirt pro </v>

646
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>nuance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened.</v>

647
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I think the way that I came up with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because in the,</v>

648
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 1>in the hunting world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this,</v>

649
00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:38.904
<v Speaker 1>speaking of conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this like there's the </v>

650
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 1>conservative traditional district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

651
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's the more progressive folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have met and been around.</v>

652
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 1>You've been around both but be around </v>
<v Speaker 1>both that are more environmentalist,</v>

653
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 1>more public lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more access.</v>

654
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

655
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.213
<v Speaker 1>so there's kind of like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's always two sides of </v>

656
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:55.524
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

657
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two distinct sides,</v>

658
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.403
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the line kind of gets drawn around </v>

659
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:01.314
<v Speaker 1>one a little bit around guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a little bit around the </v>

660
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the biggest issue in politics</v>

661
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 1>for a hunter angler right now is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like guns.</v>

662
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I like the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dig what's going on there.</v>

663
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:13.314
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I also like is healthy </v>

664
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>ecosystems and environment and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

665
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>like habitat for wild game to live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>public lands and access.</v>

666
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just so happens that a lot of the a </v>

667
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:25.674
<v Speaker 1>plus rated politicians for the NRA are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like f minus or a plus rated in </v>

668
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.553
<v Speaker 1>protecting wildlife and wild lands and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of that's around extraction and </v>

669
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.993
<v Speaker 1>different things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but extraction of minerals and oil and </v>

670
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.290
<v Speaker 1>natural reason for valuable lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

671
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 1>So then change the way these lands are </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheduled.</v>

672
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's under?</v>

673
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lot of around </v>

674
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 1>monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course that was one big one,</v>

675
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.034
<v Speaker 1>but it's just around like the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of even as a hunter but all </v>

676
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:54.324
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a hunter I'm faced with like I </v>

677
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 1>love wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love wild places,</v>

678
00:28:58.081 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 1>clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean land,</v>

679
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for that.</v>

680
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.463
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge part of what I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also believe in the second </v>

681
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:05.094
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in my right to defend my </v>

682
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:06.684
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in my rights to own firearms </v>

683
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 1>and to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe in those two things,</v>

684
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but because our politics are the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

685
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't leave room for those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

686
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.490
<v Speaker 1>When I'm at at the voting booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes not all the time,</v>

687
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:21.324
<v Speaker 1>something is hardly leaves room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those beliefs in normal conversations </v>

688
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:25.974
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you absolutely know that the </v>

689
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:32.121
<v Speaker 1>person's going to be objective and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shirt says pro nuance this,</v>

690
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.403
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you you shouldn't be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend your family is where it gets </v>

691
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:38.281
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get crazy that you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to defend your family.</v>

693
00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Like why do these</v>

694
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
<v Speaker 3>movies all have robberies and break ins </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bad guys?</v>

695
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you visit a real things?</v>

696
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.513
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that you should just be a </v>

697
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:58.291
<v Speaker 3>sitting duck because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy fucks out there that want to shoot</v>

698
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 3>up schools and go on mass shootings that</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>

699
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.553
<v Speaker 3>your being conflated with them year </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be being confused with them or </v>

700
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:08.080
<v Speaker 3>categorized with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how?</v>

701
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 3>How has that that these are different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

702
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 3>They both involve guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are there things.</v>

703
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like the insole that drove all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people in Toronto.</v>

704
00:30:17.551 --> 00:30:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Member that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

705
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that keeps happening,</v>

706
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:23.680
<v Speaker 3>that's happened many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen people kill people with cars</v>

707
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 3>over the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been like</v>

708
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.650
<v Speaker 1>four or five big events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they mutually exclusive?</v>

709
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:28.484
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to be able to defend my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and own firearms and have that </v>

710
00:30:30.891 --> 00:30:32.930
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of this country,</v>

711
00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't want people to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

712
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>

713
00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:37.904
<v Speaker 1>I want on the other side of the coin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you when it comes to environmental </v>

714
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:43.730
<v Speaker 1>issues and around hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public lands and things of that nature.</v>

715
00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I want coal miners to have jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people that work in an extraction</v>

716
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:49.574
<v Speaker 1>industries to have an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and live in and do what they need </v>

717
00:30:52.671 --> 00:30:53.504
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to protect our </v>

718
00:30:55.131 --> 00:30:57.800
<v Speaker 1>ecosystems at all costs because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't replace that shit.</v>

719
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

720
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.860
<v Speaker 3>And there's gotTa be other jobs out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

721
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.950
<v Speaker 3>If the government put its resources </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead to propping up old ways of doing</v>

722
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:08.664
<v Speaker 3>business that pollute the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus new ways of doing business with </v>

723
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.930
<v Speaker 3>government programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's entirely possible.</v>

724
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certainly reasonable and </v>

725
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.840
<v Speaker 1>healthy ways to mine copper ore or </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>

726
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

727
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's responsible ways to do that,</v>

728
00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:29.310
<v Speaker 1>but at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At what cost?</v>

729
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.990
<v Speaker 1>You're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still extracting,</v>

730
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.830
<v Speaker 1>like you're still doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

731
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You're still changing the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment there.</v>

732
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was trying to make that argument</v>

733
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:40.460
<v Speaker 3>with fracking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to them about that.</v>

734
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Is it Josh Fox's documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he?</v>

735
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:50.030
<v Speaker 3>He was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the something fracking nation.</v>

736
00:31:50.391 --> 00:31:51.140
<v Speaker 3>What was his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

737
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.973
<v Speaker 3>he made a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very good documentary and it </v>

738
00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:54.794
<v Speaker 3>was when I had him on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was interesting because he seemed </v>

739
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.920
<v Speaker 3>like he had been attacked a lot for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and even misunderstood,</v>

740
00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:01.754
<v Speaker 3>like some of the questions I was asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe they were coming from me and </v>

741
00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.081
<v Speaker 3>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

742
00:32:04.081 --> 00:32:05.720
<v Speaker 3>this is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it called?</v>

743
00:32:05.721 --> 00:32:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Fragmentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it gasland that's it.</v>

744
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

745
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.823
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

746
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.690
<v Speaker 3>it's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're watching some aspects of it,</v>

747
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:15.524
<v Speaker 3>like when were wedding lighting their </v>
<v Speaker 3>water on fire and then someone tried to </v>

748
00:32:17.751 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

749
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.870
<v Speaker 3>there's some places where you've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to let your water on fire.</v>

750
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

751
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.430
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

752
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.013
<v Speaker 3>Erica tradition of lighting a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that someone said that that's </v>

753
00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:30.020
<v Speaker 3>not really from fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

754
00:32:30.021 --> 00:32:30.854
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people said that there was no </v>

755
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.550
<v Speaker 3>lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water on fire.</v>

756
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Then people started fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water smell like shit.</v>

757
00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 3>They started lighting a fire though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying those are connected.</v>

758
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

759
00:32:42.931 --> 00:32:45.730
<v Speaker 4>we've been able to light their water on </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire for for a number of reasons,</v>

760
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.010
<v Speaker 4>but fourth of July</v>

761
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I would think to be confident about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not confident about it,</v>

762
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.760
<v Speaker 3>but to be confident about what that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>said to me when he was saying that,</v>

763
00:32:53.761 --> 00:32:54.594
<v Speaker 3>it's always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have done massive </v>

764
00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:01.440
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have spent time there.</v>

765
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.393
<v Speaker 3>You would have to been working either </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly or indirectly with the </v>

766
00:33:05.671 --> 00:33:08.940
<v Speaker 3>scientists that are collecting the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to get it from them.</v>

767
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:10.200
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to see it.</v>

768
00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:15.201
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to make sure or you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a person who is not interested in the</v>

769
00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>actual truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have an idea that they want to</v>

770
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:23.010
<v Speaker 3>push through and this is a weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with certain right wing folks.</v>

771
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.203
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird thing they want to push </v>
<v Speaker 3>through that business is good and </v>

772
00:33:26.821 --> 00:33:31.821
<v Speaker 3>environmentalists are all pussies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hippies and Weirdos and losers and these</v>

773
00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:33.084
<v Speaker 3>things don't jive in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who actually loves and </v>

774
00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:38.520
<v Speaker 3>appreciates the actual earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

775
00:33:38.521 --> 00:33:39.510
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

776
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

777
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.830
<v Speaker 4>there is no way that anyone could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

778
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:44.790
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's in the hunting world are sort of</v>

779
00:33:44.791 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 4>like access and public land and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things become a big deal,</v>

780
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 4>but you can define access and a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways.</v>

781
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accessible to me,</v>

782
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 4>access could be I like wilderness or to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only way you can access it,</v>

783
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 4>his own foot via,</v>
<v Speaker 4>via trail head.</v>

784
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Someone else might say access to me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

785
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 4>elderly folks or disabled folks fail and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get on into a car and drive through a</v>

786
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 4>road and public land or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or get into an atv and drive.</v>

787
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:17.110
<v Speaker 4>And so politics being what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politicians take this term of access.</v>

788
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:22.670
<v Speaker 4>It happened around national monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take one side,</v>

789
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:24.710
<v Speaker 4>said the president of stealing your </v>
<v Speaker 4>land,</v>

790
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 4>and the other side says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president is giving back your land.</v>

791
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're either,</v>

792
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 4>both sides are full of shit or one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them is.</v>

793
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember when this came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patagonia,</v>

794
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:40.560
<v Speaker 3>which is a giant company and doors had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big ad on the Internet that said,</v>

795
00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:42.250
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so your land,</v>

796
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.170
<v Speaker 3>and then I heard Rinella talk about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he said this is,</v>

797
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he basically said,</v>

798
00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:50.130
<v Speaker 3>if you say that the presence until your </v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

799
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not being careful with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

800
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're not being,</v>

801
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 4>you're being inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

802
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 4>You're being absolutely inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's not again,</v>

803
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 4>that you were talking about grand </v>
<v Speaker 4>staircase,</v>

804
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Escalante and bears ears National </v>
<v Speaker 4>Monument bears ears being in Utah,</v>

805
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 4>being explained to people what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A boy.</v>

806
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thank you Ben.</v>

808
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the antiquities act,</v>

809
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:14.294

<v Speaker 4>protect the antiquities act is to </v>

810
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 4>protect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

811
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.340
<v Speaker 4>culturally or socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally,</v>

812
00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:23.174
<v Speaker 4>culturally significant pieces of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of land it all the way to the things </v>

813
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 4>like the Grand Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

814
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 4>And so spin it up to the end of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot that I just skipped over,</v>

815
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to spin it up to the end </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Obama administration.</v>

816
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 4>President</v>

817
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Obama used his executive power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect large swaths,</v>

818
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:43.974
<v Speaker 1>millions of acres around the brown bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>ears national monument to protect not </v>

819
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.674
<v Speaker 1>only the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the significant places for native </v>

820
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:56.571
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for native tribesman around bears ears,</v>

821
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.283
<v Speaker 1>but many millions of acres around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it becomes the problem I </v>

822
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 1>have in the y that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tee shirt exists.</v>

823
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a political football throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

824
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not at this point in time what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>best for bears ears.</v>

825
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.760
<v Speaker 1>What's best for that National Monument </v>
<v Speaker 1>was best for,</v>

826
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 1>for it to be fairly owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's best for the people,</v>

827
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.193
<v Speaker 1>the jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place it becomes what's best for </v>

828
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>each side and their rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so president trump asked secretary,</v>

829
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 1>former secretary of Interior Ryan Zinky </v>
<v Speaker 1>to review,</v>

830
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.203
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 10 monuments to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they should be reduced based on the </v>

831
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 1>productions that Obama had put put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

832
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.103
<v Speaker 1>So he reviews these 10 monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cuts out eight of them and hones in </v>

833
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:44.754
<v Speaker 1>on two places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears ears and grand staircase </v>

834
00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Escalante.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They then say,</v>

835
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to reduce the size of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>monuments.</v>

836
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.853
<v Speaker 1>When you say cuts out eight of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by cuts out and they </v>

837
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 1>review the other eight and say they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

838
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 1>They're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No changes necessary.</v>

839
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some would say they did that as a,</v>

840
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.033
<v Speaker 1>as a straw men as eight straw men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock them over and look at those other </v>

841
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said we will reduce the.</v>

842
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 1>The the area that is designated as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national monument,</v>

843
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:13.703
<v Speaker 1>and here again it comes to both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say because the President </v>

844
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Obama wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is his powers corruptly to protect,</v>

845
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.183
<v Speaker 1>to be as an environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect lands that didn't need </v>

846
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:26.334
<v Speaker 1>protected under the antiquities act </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the antiquities act does say it </v>

847
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 1>should be the smallest acreage possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect.</v>

848
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.783
<v Speaker 1>So now you get into stuff that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>an expert in or around the legal jargon </v>

849
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and going back to things that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>written in the 19 thirties,</v>

850
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>but we get to a point where one side </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying here is the Republicans trying to</v>

851
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.683
<v Speaker 1>shrink down these monuments so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can then go to the companies that are </v>

852
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.080
<v Speaker 1>can then go and lease these places for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining,</v>

853
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but they can't currently do on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>protections as a national monument.</v>

854
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>The other side is saying we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect culturally significant lands and</v>

855
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:07.680
<v Speaker 1>these millions of acres need protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you protect for lots of reasons,</v>

856
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>so you end up with those two sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

857
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to sort of make a hype </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbolic,</v>

858
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.040
<v Speaker 1>hyperbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parabolic.</v>

859
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.123
<v Speaker 1>I always want to say that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut that back with hyperbolic argument </v>

860
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 1>one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

861
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could kind of exaggerate your</v>

862
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>position one way or the other and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being done that way.</v>

863
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.423
<v Speaker 1>It's been done that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they drilling there now or did he </v>

864
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:36.210
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

865
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.043
<v Speaker 2>Let's look that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is some leases that were that </v>

866
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 2>were approved for for bears ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for sure.</v>

867
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.853
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things where people </v>

868
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 2>talk about the president doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any real power.</v>

869
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.263
<v Speaker 2>There's congress understand that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like really they have some checks and </v>

870
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:51.034
<v Speaker 2>balances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's the executive orders that </v>

871
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 2>can come down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

872
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:54.754
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the expert on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I fumbled through some of the </v>

873
00:38:57.221 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 2>details on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

874
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 2>But to me the bottom line is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

875
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 2>why I like to to live in the centers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because something like that becomes.</v>

876
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a thing that it becomes a pr </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>

877
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a thing that people are </v>

878
00:39:11.681 --> 00:39:12.514
<v Speaker 2>throwing back there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing bears ears back and forth </v>

879
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:16.420
<v Speaker 2>because at the end of Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

880
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:17.254
<v Speaker 2>he made the designation and they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They repealed it or reversed it a year </v>

881
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:22.263
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

882
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Or some amount of time around a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

883
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 2>So it was only the way it was for a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's making it.</v>

884
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government stole your land.</v>

885
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 2>They just brought it back to exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was before,</v>

886
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.403
<v Speaker 2>but they did open up the possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why Obama did in the first </v>

887
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

888
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:36.663
<v Speaker 2>They opened up the possibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling and now they did resource </v>

889
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 2>extraction and that scares the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

890
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.473
<v Speaker 2>So like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

891
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 2>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in these situations.</v>

892
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:47.284
<v Speaker 2>There always seems to be spin on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides and being a part of these debates </v>

893
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis and being a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

894
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.530
<v Speaker 2>like bringing in this information on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis.</v>

895
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.860
<v Speaker 2>It's tiresome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

896
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tired of being pandered to buy.</v>

897
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:07.141
<v Speaker 2>People are tired of having to hear that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this value system is right or this value</v>

898
00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:08.074
<v Speaker 2>system is right and there's no room to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be anywhere close to the center around </v>

899
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:11.104
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

900
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>So you just get is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tiresome.</v>

901
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public lands are the only place where I </v>

902
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 2>look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

903
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:19.084
<v Speaker 2>you gotta leave that to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to lead it to the federal </v>

904
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

905
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>don't let leave it to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only place.</v>

906
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

907
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.690
<v Speaker 2>when I think about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

908
00:40:26.691 --> 00:40:27.524
<v Speaker 2>like with the legalization of marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they're going to legalize </v>

909
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:31.804
<v Speaker 2>silicide and apparently in Oregon </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about doing that or </v>

910
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:34.121
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

911
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:36.100
<v Speaker 2>leave it to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be able to vote that in.</v>

912
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 2>They should be able to vote in like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy laws.</v>

913
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You have weird states and some states </v>
<v Speaker 2>have state taxes,</v>

914
00:40:42.401 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 2>some states don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

915
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 2>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to like federal land,</v>

916
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:47.314
<v Speaker 2>the problem is if these dates get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt and this is what people need to </v>

917
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can sell it off.</v>

918
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Utah is in debt.</v>

919
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not picking on Youtube,</v>

920
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.990
<v Speaker 2>but if they just for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wind up in debt which states do all</v>

921
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:03.991
<v Speaker 2>the time and then they sell off a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk of land to some oil company.</v>

922
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Now you can't camp there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can and by the way,</v>

923
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 2>that's your fucking land and not pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

924
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 2>UTAH.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your land.</v>

925
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 2>You live in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in Florida.</v>

926
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 2>That's your land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in Massachusetts.</v>

927
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 2>It's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That land in Utah is the whole fucking.</v>

928
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.253
<v Speaker 2>All of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll collected human race living on </v>

929
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:27.280
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this,</v>

930
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.310
<v Speaker 2>listen to this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like there's a guy named Senator</v>

931
00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Mike Lee of the Great State of Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you rightly</v>

932
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>put that all out of these things revolve</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the Utah for some reason.</v>

933
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Do they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of the percentage of.</v>

934
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like something that's 70 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their acreage is,</v>

935
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 1>is controlled by the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

936
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Plus Mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>

937
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the first point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take got that.</v>

938
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So Senator Mike Lee Comes out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

939
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:56.144
<v Speaker 1>this is like the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect way to spend this type of </v>

940
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts,</v>

941
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.933
<v Speaker 1>he calls back to and Senator Orrin Hatch</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Utah has also done this call back </v>

942
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:06.764
<v Speaker 1>to like the sagebrush rebellion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that calling back saying </v>

943
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:11.354
<v Speaker 1>that wilderness is akin to the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy because only a certain few </v>

944
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:18.674
<v Speaker 1>can go there because you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>two working legs that can get you up </v>

945
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 1>into wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the basis of a speech he gave,</v>

946
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:26.714
<v Speaker 1>and it is given it several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that public land and wilderness </v>

947
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:30.554
<v Speaker 1>specifically is is akin to the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>European aristocracy because only </v>

948
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 1>certain folks can go there.</v>

949
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.930
<v Speaker 1>If you would open up access cut roads </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

950
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 1>then it would be for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then it gets back to the semantics in</v>

951
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 1>the spin and the things that politicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>push forward to try to convince you.</v>

952
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Well there still for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right in a certain way.</v>

953
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 1>What he's right in is that if you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>roads through,</v>

954
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 1>anybody could go through anytime they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted on a car.</v>

955
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 1>If they had no legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can barely walk.</v>

956
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:01.940
<v Speaker 1>If they are in a wheelchair normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can drive a car.</v>

957
00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:02.774
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go in deep into the woods and </v>

958
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.990
<v Speaker 1>they can enjoy all of the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

959
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>The cast off that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

960
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.503
<v Speaker 1>did I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's a lot of places </v>

961
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:14.534
<v Speaker 1>that they can't also go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theirs didn't go a lot of places where </v>

962
00:43:17.121 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to yellowstone,</v>

963
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone damn gorgeous.</v>

964
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.163
<v Speaker 1>You just drive through that and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the trees and the animals and </v>

965
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone is a wonderful proxy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>going outside.</v>

966
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an introduction to what it is </v>

967
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:29.390
<v Speaker 1>without really being in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like a zoo that's free range is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is.</v>

969
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I live right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live an hour from there and I've taken</v>

970
00:43:35.901 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>my family there and it just feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to feel like,</v>

971
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.670
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an elicit place.</v>

972
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:41.504
<v Speaker 1>As somebody who's gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilderness and tackle these big </v>

973
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 1>challenges and hiked around and crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>places this yellowstone,</v>

974
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

975
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I.</v>

976
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.343
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was this guy named cody </v>

977
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 1>rich who has a podcast called the rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoors.</v>

978
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 1>He said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

979
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an ambassador for real wilderness.</v>

980
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.603
<v Speaker 1>It's like a way to present to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this thing exists without them </v>

981
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:05.654
<v Speaker 1>having to actually strap on a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some tracking poles and hike miles </v>

982
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:10.124
<v Speaker 1>up into the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the problem whenever </v>

983
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the wilderness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so few people go to it.</v>

984
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.323
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface of Mars with the people that </v>

985
00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 1>create the rover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

986
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you know how the surface of Mars is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gums up the wheels,</v>

987
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it's read Stephen read how many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to Mars,</v>

988
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 1>how many people are really going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wilderness?</v>

989
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that many.</v>

990
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 4>It's more people going to the wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 4>than Mars.</v>

991
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.053
<v Speaker 4>But I've always said like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public lands movement in and I'm </v>

992
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.030
<v Speaker 4>definitely part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

993
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I could probably represented</v>
<v Speaker 4>the monument things better,</v>

994
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 4>but like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely part of it.</v>

995
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.390
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

996
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.230
<v Speaker 4>it's scary and a little in a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people can say like,</v>

997
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:50.064
<v Speaker 4>keep it public man and keep it public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just like apple pie and bald </v>

998
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:53.754
<v Speaker 4>eagles and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an idea that we all pay into a </v>

999
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all own.</v>

1000
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Anybody can go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super easy to get on that train.</v>

1001
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 4>It is real easy to get on that train and</v>
<v Speaker 4>lose your critical thought around what,</v>

1002
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 4>what is the idea of wilderness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1003
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.714
<v Speaker 4>because when I think of my hunting now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you first went hunting like </v>

1004
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:15.360
<v Speaker 4>five or six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would asked me this question.</v>

1005
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I would have given you a whole different</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1006
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 4>What would you have said that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I would've said that,</v>

1007
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 4>but not this answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might've said like,</v>

1008
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fairly youngish man.</v>

1009
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm only growing in 30 1:33.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1010
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 4>you're beautiful person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at you.</v>

1011
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 4>I love you too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect complexion.</v>

1012
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All your cells are firing correctly.</v>

1013
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.350
<v Speaker 4>The liver spots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet this whiskey is really good stuff.</v>

1014
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so.</v>

1015
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:41.160
<v Speaker 4>What do you think you would have called </v>
<v Speaker 4>it then?</v>

1016
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:42.803
<v Speaker 4>So what I probably would have said like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we first went hunting and NBC </v>

1017
00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:47.224
<v Speaker 4>together from Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I probably would've said would've </v>

1018
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.973
<v Speaker 4>been around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been less value based and </v>

1019
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:52.164
<v Speaker 4>more like I do it because my dad did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it because it connects me to my </v>

1020
00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my dad and my family.</v>

1021
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:58.764
<v Speaker 4>My people.</v>

1022
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 4>I do it because humanity did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked,</v>

1023
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 4>we filmed a video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember sitting on the thing,</v>

1024
00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 4>we talked a lot about our humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1025
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:06.144
<v Speaker 4>Like the drawing back to the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time when the hunter was exalted in a </v>

1026
00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:14.720
<v Speaker 4>tribe of people was the only way to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1027
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.573
<v Speaker 4>It was the only way to get meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your skills that you acquired as a </v>

1028
00:46:17.881 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 4>hunter made you important to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

1029
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 4>the society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the everyday life.</v>

1030
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I would have probably called back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1031
00:46:25.141 --> 00:46:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Not that I would say that's wrong now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I've come to find out over some</v>

1032
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 4>other years of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hunting and a lot of places is that I</v>

1033
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:37.071
<v Speaker 4>think my hunting is more about healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystems now than it is about anything</v>

1034
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:38.334
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think all of my efforts should be </v>

1035
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 4>around clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean air,</v>

1036
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:45.623
<v Speaker 4>places that we can go and explore and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that brings to our world that </v>

1037
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:50.964
<v Speaker 4>brings more wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that brings places for my son to go and </v>

1038
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:57.000
<v Speaker 4>experience these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I've changed over.</v>

1039
00:46:57.001 --> 00:47:00.450
<v Speaker 4>There's a very short time and the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I do it well,</v>

1040
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.450
<v Speaker 3>the more you experienced the wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go back to the city and then go</v>

1041
00:47:04.451 --> 00:47:05.284
<v Speaker 3>back to the wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you realize how special it is </v>

1042
00:47:06.731 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 3>out there in the mall more you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>when like today I'm a.</v>

1043
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:14.830
<v Speaker 3>When I'm flying in a helicopter over la </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my good friend Bill Burr,</v>

1044
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.550
<v Speaker 3>and as he was taking me up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at all this development.</v>

1045
00:47:18.551 --> 00:47:19.384
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment complexes that are being </v>

1046
00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:22.180
<v Speaker 3>developed and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1047
00:47:22.181 --> 00:47:24.430
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really see it when you're up here in</v>

1048
00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:26.710
<v Speaker 3>the air because you see where there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1049
00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.573
<v Speaker 3>And then like a couple of weeks later </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be flat now and then a couple of </v>

1050
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 3>weeks later they start construction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>

1051
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.193
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how it spreads and that this is </v>

1052
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:36.290
<v Speaker 3>just something that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't put a star,</v>

1053
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.740
<v Speaker 3>put a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.850
<v Speaker 3>draw a line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to keep going.</v>

1055
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make our way across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1056
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And I've heard that argument from people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't go to the wilderness,</v>

1057
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.070
<v Speaker 3>like Luco mature of the unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't overpopulated.</v>

1058
00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Luke home went to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has no one living in it.</v>

1059
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:50.943
<v Speaker 3>Flyover who looked down at all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>places that don't have cities and don't </v>

1060
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:55.600
<v Speaker 3>have roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have houses like.</v>

1061
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:56.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1062
00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For now.</v>

1063
00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.840
<v Speaker 3>You know that none of this shit was here</v>
<v Speaker 3>200</v>

1064
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.230
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cloud.</v>

1065
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.353
<v Speaker 4>We plowed ground to play the corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could have the things you have </v>

1066
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.740
<v Speaker 4>well flyover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1067
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.813
<v Speaker 4>Team 19,</v>

1068
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly over 100,</v>

1069
00:48:10.911 --> 00:48:12.080
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>

1070
00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:12.920
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing here.</v>

1071
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Wilbur Wright norvell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

1072
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.551
<v Speaker 4>see what you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1073
00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 4>if you get just go 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have nothing.</v>

1074
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 4>You have zero things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:22.523
<v Speaker 4>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some perspective and I </v>

1076
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:24.664
<v Speaker 4>think hunting has a lot going forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the fact that has urbanization </v>

1077
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1078
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:30.304
<v Speaker 4>as jobs being for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as jobs become more prevalent in </v>

1079
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:36.580
<v Speaker 4>urban places and people have to travel </v>
<v Speaker 4>from wherever they're growing up to,</v>

1080
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 4>to these urban places in live so removed</v>
<v Speaker 4>from wilderness.</v>

1081
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:42.920
<v Speaker 4>So removed from sustainability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1082
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 4>I think for a long time because hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>peaked in 1982,</v>

1083
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:48.603
<v Speaker 4>there was like 17 point 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters around that year because of </v>

1084
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Reagan was president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was president.</v>

1085
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:57.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1086
00:48:57.371 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even alive so let's not,</v>

1087
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 4>let's not do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1088
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like post World War II,</v>

1089
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 4>there was a rise in the modern hunter </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain sport hunter,</v>

1090
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 4>however you would describe it.</v>

1091
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:10.143
<v Speaker 4>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this rise in 1982 and then a </v>

1092
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:12.903
<v Speaker 4>precipitous fall right from there until </v>
<v Speaker 4>2016 was around 11 million hunters in </v>

1093
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:20.020
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a drop.</v>

1094
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:20.883
<v Speaker 4>It's a big drop in Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say that like the three things </v>

1095
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:28.831
<v Speaker 4>that I think happened or urbanization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people are getting removed from their</v>

1096
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:33.910
<v Speaker 4>getting moved away from having hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in their lives on a daily basis.</v>

1097
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Not that they're anti hunting in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1098
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 4>they're just getting removed from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that thing,</v>

1099
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 4>getting your meat on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're removed from that.</v>

1100
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.083
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times you removed from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>gardening and other types of shore </v>

1101
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.960
<v Speaker 4>sustainable use things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is Disney,</v>

1102
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.363
<v Speaker 4>like Walt Disney's a nice man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Bambi was not a good thing for our </v>

1103
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 4>collective psyche around hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just Bambi,</v>

1104
00:49:55.151 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 4>but essentially all cartoons involving </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals to animals.</v>

1105
00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Who your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even predators,</v>

1106
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 4>like Yogi was your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was your friend.</v>

1107
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.830
<v Speaker 4>He wore a tie bear attack and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hat on.</v>

1108
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.820
<v Speaker 4>He was at a picnic basket and you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>your picnic,</v>

1109
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look up.</v>

1110
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a dude.</v>

1111
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.233
<v Speaker 4>I'm recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was caught poaching in Missouri and </v>

1112
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:18.560
<v Speaker 4>the judge said that he had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1113
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 4>watch Bambi once a month during his </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire sentence.</v>

1114
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's if you can find that that is real,</v>

1115
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>that just needs a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of know what to do,</v>

1164
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the fishing exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1165
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 1>This is a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is just like everything else,</v>

1166
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.364
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are good uber </v>

1167
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:30.104
<v Speaker 1>drivers and there's some that'll try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull you under a bridge and fuck your </v>

1168
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:34.650
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bad people.</v>

1169
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point to bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there,</v>

1170
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.020
<v Speaker 1>is there a time like I always bring up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with hunting,</v>

1171
00:52:39.021 --> 00:52:39.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1172
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody killed a giraffe or somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy killed a family,</v>

1173
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>baboons and made and did a photo.</v>

1174
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>

1175
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 1>It was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good.</v>

1176
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking primate bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1177
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing good about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1178
00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>that never going to go well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to go well for you.</v>

1179
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Did he put it online?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1180
00:52:58.491 --> 00:52:59.324
<v Speaker 1>he didn't put it online is I guess the </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit that would give the guy who put </v>

1181
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:03.044
<v Speaker 1>it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Idaho statesman or whatever the </v>

1182
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Idaho local favorite was the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1183
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 1>probably from one of the folks he sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>an email,</v>

1184
00:53:09.831 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>a mass email out to friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues and things of like recapping.</v>

1185
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Recapping is hunt in africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's all the things I did and he,</v>

1186
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I think from my reading on the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

1187
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got a lot of mutual friends with </v>

1188
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a good guy.</v>

1189
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Like you just screwed up.</v>

1190
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they made a bad choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough sell.</v>

1191
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:30.203
<v Speaker 4>I would say so too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I should put him in a cell and make </v>

1192
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 4>some monkey movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he knew,</v>

1193
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:35.723
<v Speaker 4>like if I put this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I put this spin up after this planet </v>

1194
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:43.554
<v Speaker 4>of the apes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta watch the mark walberg planet </v>

1195
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:45.594
<v Speaker 4>of the apes,</v>

1196
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.793
<v Speaker 3>the reality of baboons and I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've studied the work of robert </v>

1197
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:52.014
<v Speaker 3>sapolsky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a guy who's been on the podcast </v>

1198
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>before and it's really pretty amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1199
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.983
<v Speaker 3>What they found out about baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he studied actually because he actually </v>

1200
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:04.770
<v Speaker 3>studied a baboon tribe that the alpha </v>
<v Speaker 3>males died off.</v>

1201
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 3>They were all eating out of a poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 3>garbage patch.</v>

1202
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:12.690
<v Speaker 3>There was a garbage patch to the sick </v>
<v Speaker 3>food in it and I'm just bad food.</v>

1203
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 3>And the alpha males who got to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

1204
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always chased her,</v>

1205
00:54:17.051 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 3>but they wound up dying off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for more than one generation,</v>

1206
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:22.044
<v Speaker 3>I think it was several generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They became like really peaceful and </v>

1207
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:26.484
<v Speaker 3>calm and they weren't the vicious </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent baboons that are the norm and </v>

1208
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.540
<v Speaker 3>that it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you google it,</v>

1209
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 3>a supple ski studies baboons and I radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>lab also had a podcast about it,</v>

1210
00:54:38.281 --> 00:54:39.114
<v Speaker 3>which is where I first heard about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I read what paul wrote about </v>

1211
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:43.074
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is unbelievably fascinating and </v>

1212
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:49.191
<v Speaker 3>shows how you can have this insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent animal culture and then the,</v>

1213
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the clients get removed and when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cops get removed,</v>

1214
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 3>everybody chills the fuck out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1215
00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 3>really quite fascinating.</v>

1216
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.143
<v Speaker 3>BuT I'm baboons for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe he shot the nicest </v>

1217
00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:05.370
<v Speaker 3>prevalence ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part they're a bunch of</v>

1218
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 3>baby cunts and they'll steal your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking kid.</v>

1219
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.570
<v Speaker 3>That was a two year old that you love so</v>
<v Speaker 3>dearly.</v>

1220
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 3>That little motherfucker be on a porch </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and if there's baboons around,</v>

1221
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.420
<v Speaker 3>they'll snatch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need his head.</v>

1222
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.860
<v Speaker 4>When I was in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred africa one time in my life and</v>

1223
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 4>the ph and our guide both said at our </v>
<v Speaker 4>church as a professional hunter,</v>

1224
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.823
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The structure is like there's a </v>

1225
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 4>professional hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially your guide and then</v>

1226
00:55:26.521 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 4>there's trackers which are usually </v>
<v Speaker 4>native folks that that help tracking the</v>

1227
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 4>game spot in the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

1228
00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:33.450
<v Speaker 4>BuT our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our ph,</v>

1229
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.580
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you see a bad beer and shoot it,</v>

1230
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.873
<v Speaker 4>it's like we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have lots of irrigation here to </v>

1231
00:55:38.281 --> 00:55:42.570
<v Speaker 4>maintain this ranch and they rip it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're basically terrorists around,</v>

1232
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming around our camp,</v>

1233
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 4>mess with our fires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>messing with our food.</v>

1234
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:48.063
<v Speaker 4>If you see one sheet one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was the instruction that I got </v>

1235
00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 4>and I never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never did.</v>

1236
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:53.994
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gIven that instruction from somebody </v>

1237
00:55:56.551 --> 00:55:57.030
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1238
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a good thing for our landscape.</v>

1239
00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:59.723
<v Speaker 4>Go and do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very far removed from stacking </v>

1240
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:02.300
<v Speaker 4>them up.</v>

1241

<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1243

<v Speaker 4>How you can.</v>

1247
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.770
<v Speaker 4>They don't stay in one place either.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1253
00:56:25.001 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1254
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:27.280
<v Speaker 2>don't tell anybody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>deceased primate.</v>

1258
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was in africa and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got attacked by a ba boom,</v>

1259
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:37.723
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ba boom,</v>

1260
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.593
<v Speaker 2>steals food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what the context of it was was </v>

1261
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few years ago.</v>

1262
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 2>But he said it was spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said they don't seem like a,</v>

1263
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 2>a monkey and they don't seem like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem like a dog monkey.</v>

1264
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Electric wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see when they open their mouth?</v>

1265
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dog mouth monkey.</v>

1266
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dog fucked a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you really like show a baboons,</v>

1267
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 2>baboons with his mouth open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never thought of it that way,</v>

1268
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:07.234
<v Speaker 2>but I'll give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have a long stretched out </v>

1269
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a wolf or something.</v>

1270
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:15.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real weird man,</v>

1272
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1273
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.120
<v Speaker 2>they have all these characteristics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are of primates,</v>

1274
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.223
<v Speaker 2>but then they have this extra weirdness </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them and this wildness tune to it </v>

1275
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.270
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have come down to like the core </v>
<v Speaker 2>of days.</v>

1276
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1277
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1278
00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:29.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1279
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 2>that is a werewolf that's like part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1280
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Face that lion roll back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at the,</v>

1281
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.390
<v Speaker 2>even the shape of the jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very dog.</v>

1282
00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very elongated and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dog like they're very.</v>

1283
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that face man.</v>

1284
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And that is a crazy beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friend said,</v>

1285
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I forget the story was quite a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1286
00:57:56.191 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 2>but I stole some food and snarled at him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and snatch something from.</v>

1287
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.220
<v Speaker 2>But he said it was very scary.</v>

1288
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1289
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.100
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even that big with like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 pounds or something like that.</v>

1290
00:58:08.101 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pending.</v>

1291
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.230
<v Speaker 2>They'll fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd say,</v>

1292
00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:12.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 2>it's different if you live in around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1294
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.873
<v Speaker 2>It's Just these things are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about around the </v>

1295
00:58:17.531 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 2>old media to incorporate officers the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day around how do you,</v>

1296
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 2>how do we as hunters who are around </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals all the time and shit,</v>

1297
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 2>how do we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then something happens.</v>

1298
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gets mad about this guy killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>

1299
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.993
<v Speaker 2>these baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we say when there's a hunting </v>

1300
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:34.820
<v Speaker 2>scandal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You why said,</v>

1301
00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Speaker 2>oF course I let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1302
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.870
<v Speaker 2>most people don't even know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1303
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 2>it is world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one was on like nbc,</v>

1304
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:42.870
<v Speaker 2>cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>

1305
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:43.743
<v Speaker 2>this one was pretty big and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's invariably these things happen </v>

1306
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:47.854
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come that didn't go as big as cecil </v>

1307
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.900
<v Speaker 2>stop and think about that because to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more,</v>

1308
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:54.310
<v Speaker 2>it's more kind of fucked up.</v>

1309
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 2>It's more egregious than the cecil thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an it's a normal thing,</v>

1310
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but I think I just think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>desensitized to it.</v>

1311
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Cecil came in at a time where there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>more sensitivity to it and it just hit a</v>

1312
00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:05.344
<v Speaker 2>new cycle like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trump news cycle probably dominates </v>

1313
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.530
<v Speaker 2>any other thing that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

1314
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:13.603
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I say that cecil's </v>

1315
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:15.760
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it's good.</v>

1316
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should just go over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and shoot lines,</v>

1317
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:20.583
<v Speaker 2>but people been doing it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you asked me how many people go </v>

1318
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 2>over there to hunt baboons and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they really?</v>

1319
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that like a normal thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like does.</v>

1320
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1321
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.363
<v Speaker 2>Like even though I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had this conversation many </v>

1322
00:59:33.681 --> 00:59:34.514
<v Speaker 2>times on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should shoot things </v>

1323
00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:37.064
<v Speaker 2>that you don't eat unless there's a need</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like some sort of an </v>

1324
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 2>imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just as a joke.</v>

1325
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if eagles were like rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were everywhere.</v>

1326
00:59:48.951 --> 00:59:52.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why you could just kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>rats because you have to,</v>

1327
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what overpopulation looks like.</v>

1328
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.024
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a trap in your fucking garage </v>

1329
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.950
<v Speaker 2>and you smash the head of this living </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature and you're happy.</v>

1330
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Almost all things are categorized as </v>
<v Speaker 2>road until you do that too.</v>

1331
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true.</v>

1332
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:06.141
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1333
01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Like squirrels are cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're adorable,</v>

1334
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.840
<v Speaker 2>but they just don't get in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they were getting,</v>

1335
01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:11.674
<v Speaker 2>there is half a dozen squirrels in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>garage and you could set traps and get </v>

1336
01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 2>them out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would.</v>

1337
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.093
<v Speaker 2>But it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you would feel bad if you stomped </v>

1338
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:19.690
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably I wouldn't.</v>

1339
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 2>You'd stomp a rat like people still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've saw a rat in your kid's room.</v>

1340
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You'd fucking stump that thing to death </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>

1341
01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.213
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you saw a squirrel and your kids are </v>

1342
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 2>a blanket over it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those types of value.</v>

1343
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we apply those value systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to animals like that?</v>

1344
01:00:33.131 --> 01:00:33.964
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're overpopulated and </v>

1345
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.880
<v Speaker 2>because traditionally there have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>carriers have plague.</v>

1346
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Will the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real story about the black plague.</v>

1347
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that the rats were </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying,</v>

1348
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.324
<v Speaker 2>but in fact that the ticks and the was </v>
<v Speaker 2>it ticks or fleas that were on the rats </v>

1349
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:53.360
<v Speaker 2>were carrying the black plague.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want to say it's fleas,</v>

1350
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that this was how the bubonic plague</v>

1351
01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.080
<v Speaker 2>got spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got spread actually,</v>

1352
01:00:57.081 --> 01:00:57.914
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the ticks that were carried by </v>

1353
01:00:59.091 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 2>the rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what it is.</v>

1354
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.893
<v Speaker 2>Fleas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fleas.</v>

1355
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you jane with google search.</v>

1356
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1357
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.983
<v Speaker 2>the difference is that squirrels are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>overpopulated and that raptors are </v>

1358
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:10.910
<v Speaker 2>killing them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like left and right.</v>

1359
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a primary source of food for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these flying raptors,</v>

1360
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 2>eagles and hawks and stuff like that.</v>

1361
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of other things eat them </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1362
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>but there's enough balance out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But rats,</v>

1363
01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>rats lock into us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1364
01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they lived without us for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once they found us,</v>

1365
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1366
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.653
<v Speaker 2>look at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These dumb mother fuckers have holes in </v>

1367
01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>their ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can live under their houses.</v>

1368
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.710
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put garbage out every day.</v>

1369
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Just go jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're garbage.</v>

1370
01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:38.750
<v Speaker 2>You got plenty of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1371
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:42.260
<v Speaker 2>will he treat all types of animals very </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

1372
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:43.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we apply our own specific feelings </v>

1373
01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>about these animals to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the bear with the name doesn't know</v>

1374
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:53.870
<v Speaker 2>that it has a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wolf or the name doesn't know it has</v>

1375
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:54.704
<v Speaker 2>a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not aware that we've applied this </v>

1376
01:01:57.441 --> 01:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>special meaning to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know that it's still our,</v>

1377
01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 2>our application of our feelings and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>engendering this.</v>

1378
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:08.870
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't change the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf or the bear.</v>

1379
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.440
<v Speaker 2>It will rip your face off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will kill as many elk as it can.</v>

1380
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.603
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem in depicting </v>

1381
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:15.434
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anthropomorphization of animals to </v>

1382
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>picks them as your friends and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard thing to shake.</v>

1383
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.713
<v Speaker 2>There's not that they're bad and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the real problem with someone </v>

1384
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 2>going around shooting baboons and posing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you did.</v>

1385
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 2>A great thing is it's not that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are bad.</v>

1386
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.360
<v Speaker 2>They should be respected and understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and appreciate.</v>

1387
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.203
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a part of a baboons cleanup </v>

1388
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:37.310
<v Speaker 2>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're winning.</v>

1389
01:02:37.311 --> 01:02:38.144
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to rainelle is podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>today and they were talking about </v>

1390
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:42.984
<v Speaker 2>kangaroos in Australia and that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a guy on the show that had killed </v>

1391
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 2>somewhere near was like 7,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many thousands,</v>

1392
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 2>thousands like his dad's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>

1393
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 2>What was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a flood.</v>

1394
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably mess this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is some sort of weather event that</v>

1395
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:56.634
<v Speaker 2>pushed all these kangaroos onto to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's ranch and his dad was going out </v>

1396
01:02:58.621 --> 01:02:59.454
<v Speaker 2>every day and just whacking at nauseum </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of rows and that they have to </v>

1397
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 2>do this because they don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural predators and they.</v>

1398
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 2>They'll just devastate landscapes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've played videos.</v>

1399
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Cvfi one real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll play.</v>

1400
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 2>We'll get kicked off of youtube probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1401
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of like a swarm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kangaroos in Australia.</v>

1402
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Did I have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1403
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were reading about it,</v>

1404
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 2>about the overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

1405
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just like hundred pound locust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was reaDing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the guy's name,</v>

1407
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 2>but I was reading this paper just so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see.</v>

1408
01:03:30.061 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 2>It was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't put it up on the youtube.</v>

1409
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the kids to get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1410
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.330
<v Speaker 2>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This ain't.</v>

1411
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 2>This ain't shit in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty great.</v>

1412
01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:40.314
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all boobs.</v>

1413
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.453
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were watching one when there was </v>

1414
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>a swarm running across a field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1415
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>look at that bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rats.</v>

1416
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1417
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>if you saw that many rats in a field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>

1418
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I am going to go get my gun and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kill these fucking rats.</v>

1419
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>YOu wouldn't tolerate that,</v>

1420
01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:58.044
<v Speaker 2>but these are cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like the endangered species act </v>

1421
01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.513
<v Speaker 2>coming into play here and in a weird way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these are caring for animals </v>

1422
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 2>dictated by the number of the animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is.</v>

1423
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 2>It isn't an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1424
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.420
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for us.</v>

1425
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.313
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're over here in the valley of </v>

1426
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.590
<v Speaker 2>southern California and right brains.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have a good old time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fairness.</v>

1430
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 2>We live a good life here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in Australia,</v>

1431
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 2>you're killing those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1432
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:26.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you.</v>

1433
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.620
<v Speaker 2>When I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remy warren,</v>

1434
01:04:28.621 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 2>our mutual friend first took me to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>

1435
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 2>He took me to a sheep station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant that's basicallY a ranch,</v>

1436
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.420
<v Speaker 2>big sheep ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hunted fallow deer,</v>

1437
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:40.920
<v Speaker 2>the deer everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the way out.</v>

1438
01:04:40.921 --> 01:04:44.870
<v Speaker 2>We met a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call him the rabbit man or like he.</v>

1439
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:46.323
<v Speaker 2>He looked like a superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was riding on like a just a two </v>

1440
01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:52.080
<v Speaker 2>stroke bike with like a rabbit hide </v>
<v Speaker 2>covers for the handles.</v>

1441
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:54.380
<v Speaker 2>He had a helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like a superhero,</v>

1442
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.310
<v Speaker 2>like a leather jacket and was like a 22 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was riding around.</v>

1443
01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:02.370
<v Speaker 2>His job was to ride around and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits all night long every day,</v>

1444
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week.</v>

1445
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 2>He had killed millions of rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>

1446
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.370
<v Speaker 2>millions and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would log every night,</v>

1447
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 2>come back and log the number of rabbIts </v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed.</v>

1448
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 2>They weren't eating these rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was population control.</v>

1449
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>These robots were or digging under these</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits were destroying the landscape.</v>

1450
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:20.254
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't run sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the land was invaluable because </v>

1451
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>these rabbits where it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn of the century America.</v>

1452
01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:27.383
<v Speaker 2>We had some of the same situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we met this guy who's job it was to </v>

1453
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 2>with impunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kills many rabbits as he possibly could.</v>

1454
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>A rabbit's invasive species down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be.</v>

1455
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:39.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll find out because this was New </v>

1456
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Zealand and most like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1457
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything is non native and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a crazy spot.</v>

1458
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my favorite spots.</v>

1459
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I can be on the board for tourism for </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand.</v>

1460
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:53.134
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowing the rabbits were </v>

1461
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>introduced to Australia and 18th </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred.</v>

1462
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about New Zealand?</v>

1463
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not paying attention right next to right</v>

1464
01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>next to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't swim bro.</v>

1465
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Rapid on swim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bet it's the same thing.</v>

1466
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we never,</v>

1467
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.223
<v Speaker 2>we never did get so deep into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive species and number introduced </v>

1468
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 2>rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>European rabbit.</v>

1469
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:17.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1470
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>I think everything in in New Zealand was</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced most most.</v>

1471
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:22.803
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New zealanD really needs to kill these </v>

<v Speaker 2>adorable rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

1474
01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You can eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking dogs.</v>

1475
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Rabbits are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.493

<v Speaker 2>we put it in this little cute cage and </v>

1479
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.670
<v Speaker 2>when it wants to come out and be held </v>
<v Speaker 2>and puts his little paws on tissue,</v>

1480
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.970

<v Speaker 2>hunting and I was reading this.</v>

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 2>decimation of the population of certain </v>

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.033
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lives in bozeman and he's great and we </v>

1605
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:06.594
<v Speaker 4>were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a deal about ethics and a lot of </v>

1606
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 4>folks wrote in and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be interested to hear what you think</v>

1607
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:13.974
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If if an animal is wounded and you're </v>

1608
01:12:18.391 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 4>say you're up in a tree stand or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

1609
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot and stalk,</v>

1610
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.590
<v Speaker 4>or you're in the case of randy hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a waterhole.</v>

1611
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.230
<v Speaker 4>If you're doing that in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in you're a hunter,</v>

1612
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:29.064
<v Speaker 4>you hold a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can choose which animal you'd like </v>

1613
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:31.380
<v Speaker 4>to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1614
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.900
<v Speaker 4>You have a buck or a doe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male or female tag.</v>

1615
01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:37.620
<v Speaker 4>What you can choose which one he wants </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill it.</v>

1616
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.620
<v Speaker 4>If an animal comes by you that has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>wounded,</v>

1617
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 4>clearly been wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly struggling,</v>

1618
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the case of a rainy newburgh,</v>

1619
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:48.323
<v Speaker 4>he was sitting on a waterhole and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe he was in Arizona with a trophy </v>

1620
01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:52.134
<v Speaker 4>tag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means there was a lot of big meal </v>

1621
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:55.164
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're walking around and a lot of big </v>

1622
01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 4>antelope walking around there in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1623
01:12:57.361 --> 01:12:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Pronghorn.</v>

1624
01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:58.993
<v Speaker 3>Let's explain to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening that don't know what we're </v>

1625
01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:03.000
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he says a trophy tag.</v>

1626
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:06.960
<v Speaker 3>What he means is there's some units that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are designated as trophy areas.</v>

1627
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't meAn you don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animal.</v>

1628
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 3>What it does mean is that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to get into this area.</v>

1629
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To have a certain amount of points which</v>

1630
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 3>means you are putting in to the pool of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1631
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.490
<v Speaker 3>That is a for conservation for habitat </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

1632
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:24.623
<v Speaker 3>All you're puttIng in every year to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a tag and you could only get a </v>

1633
01:13:28.591 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 3>tag and a lot of these places once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime for some places,</v>

1634
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 3>10 years on tags that are once every 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1635
01:13:35.671 --> 01:13:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very complicated point </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

1636
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:37.914
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1637
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.300
<v Speaker 3>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain why they do that,</v>

1638
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:44.330
<v Speaker 3>they do that to preserve the population </v>
<v Speaker 3>of big mature animals so that this.</v>

1639
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 3>You can't just let anybody go in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some places that are called</v>

1640
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:48.234
<v Speaker 3>over the counter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the counter unit is is they know </v>

1641
01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:52.104
<v Speaker 3>that there's a large healthy population </v>
<v Speaker 3>of animals and they either the wildlife </v>

1642
01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.264
<v Speaker 3>biologists in the state representative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they choose to just let anybody go in </v>

1643
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 3>and when they think the animals are </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminishing too much,</v>

1644
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.213
<v Speaker 3>then they'll put a cap on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for now it's an over the counter </v>

1645
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:07.590
<v Speaker 3>unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1646
01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 3>And then they have places that are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to draw units.</v>

1647
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those difficult to</v>

1648
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.873
<v Speaker 2>draw units is one of the places where </v>
<v Speaker 2>randy newburgh was because he was </v>

1649
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 2>looking for a big old mature animal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it spreads genetic and it's tough.</v>

1650
01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Like the term turf has been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaponized.</v>

1651
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:22.873
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my fault for using like when you </v>

1652
01:14:24.521 --> 01:14:25.354
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use it not in the term that most </v>

1653
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 2>peopLe think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of trophies,</v>

1654
01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mature animal.</v>

1655
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 2>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a lifetime.</v>

1656
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 2>It takes many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years to draw.</v>

1657
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I think you should just call it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited,</v>

1658
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 2>limited jarl unit draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1659
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.603
<v Speaker 2>hard to get every once in a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt where you're never going to hunt </v>

1660
01:14:41.431 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 2>there again and you're looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most unique animal that you can find,</v>

1661
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the most mature animal that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find,</v>

1662
01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:47.290
<v Speaker 2>but along the way,</v>

1663
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but along the way,</v>

1664
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:49.960
<v Speaker 4>like in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethically,</v>

1665
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:50.794
<v Speaker 4>he runs into a limping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antelope pronghorn it comes into a </v>

1666
01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:56.440
<v Speaker 4>waterhole on is limping to the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he thinks,</v>

1667
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:57.710
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1668
01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.930
<v Speaker 4>and this happens to a lot of hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1669
01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this tag.</v>

1670
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.060
<v Speaker 4>I've waited a long time to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very unique tag,</v>

1671
01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:04.894
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the way you explained it and would I </v>

1672
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 4>know I can eat this animal just the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I would any other one,</v>

1673
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:17.940
<v Speaker 4>but to to to exercise some mercy around </v>
<v Speaker 4>this antelope that's clearly suffering,</v>

1674
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.133
<v Speaker 4>clearly injured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows how iT got injured to limping </v>

1675
01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.220
<v Speaker 4>up to a water hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>

1676
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.300
<v Speaker 4>He's having this ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pondering in his head like,</v>

1677
01:15:28.301 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 4>should I dispatch this thing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

1678
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 4>Fill my tag this way because with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a tag and that tag,</v>

1679
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 4>you can then choose to do anything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want with it in legal bounds.</v>

1680
01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.653
<v Speaker 2>You wish you didn't wound this animal so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could let that animal pass and </v>

1681
01:15:42.031 --> 01:15:42.864
<v Speaker 2>choose a a larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more mature and more impressive than </v>

1682
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.620
<v Speaker 2>them and you get to let nature take its </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

1683
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:49.980
<v Speaker 2>whether a predation or not in the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this one,</v>

1684
01:15:49.981 --> 01:15:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but winter kill or something may take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that animal or you can</v>

1685
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.710
<v Speaker 4>and it's a quote unquote suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You doN't know.</v>

1686
01:15:55.711 --> 01:15:58.350
<v Speaker 4>We can't talk tO the animal and ask it </v>
<v Speaker 4>his opinion,</v>

1687
01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:02.100
<v Speaker 4>but you can end what looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering and fill your tag in that way.</v>

1688
01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:03.123
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way normal hans play out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of hunters are put in that </v>

1689
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:06.770
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1690
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Cool situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare,</v>

1691
01:16:08.271 --> 01:16:09.360
<v Speaker 2>but it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

1692
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:11.630
<v Speaker 2>It never happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we did is your answer,</v>

1693
01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:13.850
<v Speaker 2>so the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his answer was to shoot.</v>

1694
01:16:13.851 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 2>That was a shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that analog.</v>

1695
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.850
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1696
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Because also here's another possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1697
01:16:18.981 --> 01:16:20.270
<v Speaker 2>antelopes come by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1698
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:23.570
<v Speaker 2>so if no nos come by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by fate,</v>

1699
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't get an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you spend seven days out there in the</v>

1700
01:16:27.591 --> 01:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>wilderness and you come home empty </v>
<v Speaker 2>handed,</v>

1701
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:30.584
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to eat an antelope or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're presented with this opportunity </v>

1702
01:16:34.581 --> 01:16:35.414
<v Speaker 2>to be merciful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take this animal out that's injured </v>

1703
01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.293
<v Speaker 2>and you get to keep an antelope and </v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's not the antelope that you </v>

1704
01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:41.324
<v Speaker 2>dreamed of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that would still healthy </v>

1705
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to feel good.</v>

1706
01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:45.734
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you really did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put an animal out of its misery and </v>

1707
01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:52.130
<v Speaker 2>and we all like mercy is a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.780
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all would like to be like,</v>

1709
01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.280
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I said this in in randy kind of,</v>

1710
01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.720
<v Speaker 4>we talked through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I said that,</v>

1711
01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.510
<v Speaker 4>that this is a unique situation to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter.</v>

1712
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 4>If you're a hiker and you come across an</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal wounded in this way or injured in</v>

1713
01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.020
<v Speaker 4>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's very little you can do.</v>

1714
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is unique</v>

1715
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 1>to the hunter's responsibility to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this animal and make this decision.</v>

1716
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's another argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>another argument is you really should do</v>

1717
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:19.514
<v Speaker 1>nothing because those are the animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are designated to be taken out by </v>

1718
01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the predators and you want to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predator population.</v>

1719
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>That was more my answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy's answer.</v>

1720
01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went back and forth course and um,</v>

1721
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I see both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see both sides too.</v>

1722
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:32.023
<v Speaker 1>And I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those situations where as </v>

1723
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:35.980
<v Speaker 1>a hunter there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1724
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another Podcast I did with a guy</v>

1725
01:17:37.851 --> 01:17:40.490
<v Speaker 1>named do sean's Montana and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1726
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:40.781
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1727
01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>his real name,</v>

1728
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>he's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's Montana,</v>

1729
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:44.771
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shawn smith.</v>

1730
01:17:44.771 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Dan is from checklists of akio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an outdoor photographer and he's,</v>

1731
01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 1>he's a dope individual at a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>human that'd be with that name.</v>

1732
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives up to that.</v>

1733
01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 1>And tHe important thing we'd like sit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fire,</v>

1734
01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say the [inaudible] fire.</v>

1735
01:17:57.831 --> 01:17:58.664
<v Speaker 1>And because we were handmade boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he does show the fuck out of </v>

1736
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:03.360
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think he's aware?</v>

1737
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And he would make his own moccasins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most interesting man in the world.</v>

1738
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.680
<v Speaker 1>He's verY much this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes.</v>

1739
01:18:08.681 --> 01:18:09.514
<v Speaker 1>So I did a podcast with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sat by his fire and we drank plum </v>

1740
01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:15.410
<v Speaker 1>brandy that he makes himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it does.</v>

1741
01:18:15.411 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes his own honey.</v>

1742
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.870
<v Speaker 1>He has icelandic sheep that he shares </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he eats.</v>

1743
01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.713
<v Speaker 1>He does a sada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kills a lamb everywhere and feeds </v>

1744
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:23.054
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assad.</v>

1745
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.953
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in checklists of akio and </v>

1746
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 1>part of his describing his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his growing up is like in,</v>

1747
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

1748
01:18:32.931 --> 01:18:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll butcher the pronunciation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mikayla,</v>

1749
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:35.824
<v Speaker 1>vic is the term that he used to describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunter as like hunter or the one who </v>

1750
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>thinks and the way he described the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1751
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.990
<v Speaker 1>the cultural significance of 100 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1752
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:46.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1753
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>when he was growing up in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties and,</v>

1754
01:18:47.941 --> 01:18:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and checklist vacuum was that the hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be,</v>

1755
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the judge and jury.</v>

1756
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.993
<v Speaker 1>So there was like a reverenCe around </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting or reverence around a hunter </v>

1757
01:18:58.431 --> 01:18:59.264
<v Speaker 1>because hunter got the privilege in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his culture to be the judge and jury </v>

1758
01:19:04.551 --> 01:19:06.530
<v Speaker 1>for what animal it gets taken out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>herd.</v>

1759
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Like making that very serious decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

1760
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>this animal is wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this animal is too old,</v>

1761
01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.900
<v Speaker 1>this animal is young enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1762
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:18.734
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about a lot on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast with some other smart hunters </v>

1763
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.280
<v Speaker 1>that I think what hunting needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become now that it isn't,</v>

1764
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 1>is this exalted status in our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're at,</v>

1765
01:19:32.061 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 1>we're giving somebody with a hunting tag</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a hunting license.</v>

1766
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:35.924
<v Speaker 1>You're giving somebody the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a decision about somethings </v>

1767
01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1768
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:40.694
<v Speaker 1>you say exalted status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THe problem is you don't have to earn </v>

1769
01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.040
<v Speaker 1>that status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1770
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:44.503
<v Speaker 1>You could just go out and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I've found </v>

1771
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:48.824
<v Speaker 1>out about hunting that is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's necessarily </v>

1772
01:19:52.551 --> 01:19:53.660
<v Speaker 1>surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1773
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:58.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to express without </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal experience,</v>

1774
01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:02.620
<v Speaker 1>is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences are.</v>

1775
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 1>it's so different than what you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1776
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very physically</v>

1777
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.293
<v Speaker 3>exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coNsequences of your actions are so </v>

1778
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:12.384
<v Speaker 3>grave in the rewards are so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than any other way of </v>

1779
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 3>acquiring food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even fIshing,</v>

1780
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.290
<v Speaker 3>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love fishing.</v>

1781
01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I love fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to eat them.</v>

1782
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 3>They're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are delicious.</v>

1783
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I'd catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fun.</v>

1784
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I like catching fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same.</v>

1785
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.540
<v Speaker 3>There is something that we in and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think this is a learned thing.</v>

1786
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:31.733
<v Speaker 3>I think there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a connection to difficult to </v>

1787
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:34.824
<v Speaker 3>acquire mammals that goes deep in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>dna and I think this is the reason whY </v>

1788
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:41.363
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons why we enjoy </v>

1789
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:43.344
<v Speaker 3>fishing is because those reward systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>were put in place by people that </v>

1790
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:48.054
<v Speaker 3>survived by eating fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by all those generations of people that </v>

1791
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 3>did catch fish and that was how they ate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>

1792
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 3>That excitement lives inside of you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you sparked that up.</v>

1793
01:20:57.481 --> 01:20:58.750
<v Speaker 3>When you get a big steel head on,</v>

1794
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:04.130
<v Speaker 4>he hear that real go because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>being informed,</v>

1795
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:06.550
<v Speaker 4>being informed by people that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a choice man.</v>

1796
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.530
<v Speaker 4>Like these are people that had to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fish to live.</v>

1797
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even though it's recreation to you,</v>

1798
01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:12.243
<v Speaker 3>it's a thrilling recreation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the consequences aren't as </v>

1799
01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:16.144
<v Speaker 3>grave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about a wounded deer </v>

1800
01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:23.690
<v Speaker 3>or wounded elk that is so horrific and </v>
<v Speaker 3>immersive,</v>

1801
01:21:23.691 --> 01:21:27.760
<v Speaker 3>merciful killing that is so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so such a relief.</v>

1802
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.210
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something powerful about it.</v>

1803
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shot that elk,</v>

1804
01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that it's out there that walked four </v>
<v Speaker 3>yards and I'm not exaggerating for yards</v>

1805
01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:41.560
<v Speaker 3>and fell over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was dead like that.</v>

1806
01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.113
<v Speaker 3>And the guYs who were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said it was quicker than any rifle </v>

1807
01:21:45.221 --> 01:21:47.830
<v Speaker 3>shot they'd ever seen an elk die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1808
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:52.630
<v Speaker 3>they usually stand up longer from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody wants.</v>

1809
01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.950
<v Speaker 3>That horses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wants it.</v>

1810
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:58.630
<v Speaker 3>They want a course they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I catch a fish and uh,</v>

1811
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:59.583
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pull them out of the water and throw </v>

1812
01:22:01.121 --> 01:22:03.430
<v Speaker 3>them on the ice and he's flopping around</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a few hours.</v>

1813
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm just happy I got him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1814
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.093
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

1815
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.581
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd like,</v>

1816
01:22:06.581 --> 01:22:09.770
<v Speaker 4>you've had michael pollen on the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>before he wrote that omnivore's dilemma.</v>

1817
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.340
<v Speaker 4>And in it he just said basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm paraphrasing,</v>

1818
01:22:13.341 --> 01:22:14.174
<v Speaker 4>but he said it hunting is so different </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the inside than it is from the </v>

1819
01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:18.200
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1820
01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:19.034
<v Speaker 4>So easy to view hunting in the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a dude sitting behind a </v>

1821
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.750
<v Speaker 4>deer smiling and grabbing its antlers.</v>

1822
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.200
<v Speaker 3>There's also the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>malnutrition.</v>

1823
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.053
<v Speaker 3>This country is almost nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fat people are poor people in this </v>

1824
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fucked.</v>

1825
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Like poor people are fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the weirder things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>our society.</v>

1827
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:37.974
<v Speaker 3>This has never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has never happened in the history </v>

1828
01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:43.790
<v Speaker 3>of human beings that the poor people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the big fat ones,</v>

1829
01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:44.850
<v Speaker 3>they got Cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1830
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of rich people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat too.</v>

1831
01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:46.974
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's people who don't have a </v>

1832
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 3>problem being fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1833
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.083
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this doesn't mean that does not a </v>

1834
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.570
<v Speaker 3>lot of malnutrition there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>most certainly is,</v>

1835
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1836
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:57.623
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lack of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lack of calories was a massive problem </v>

1837
01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>throughout most of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lack lack of food,</v>

1838
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.140
<v Speaker 3>so it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The access to food Is so normal to us.</v>

1839
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy,</v>

1840
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 4>but the unfettered access to food is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's really normal now.</v>

1841
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what's changed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>industrialization and coming on fast,</v>

1842
01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 4>fast food is processed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>food is fucked.</v>

1843
01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had.</v>

1844
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.163
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to when people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when hunting was more normal in the 19 </v>

1845
01:23:26.371 --> 01:23:29.430
<v Speaker 3>twenties or the 19 thirties are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

1846
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.710
<v Speaker 3>There was also no fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:32.603
<v Speaker 3>So when you would get a roast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you went into a butcher and you </v>

1848
01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:36.144
<v Speaker 3>got a roast and you brought it home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were making roast beef and you're </v>

1849
01:23:38.491 --> 01:23:41.670
<v Speaker 3>cooking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your uncle shot a deer,</v>

1850
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:45.730
<v Speaker 4>sat milk was delivered to your door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:47.700
<v Speaker 4>not my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1852
01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:49.590
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was wrong.</v>

1853
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:50.810
<v Speaker 4>It was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:51.840
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:23:51.841 --> 01:23:53.430
<v Speaker 4>like the removal from</v>

1856
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.600
<v Speaker 3>the actual process that hunters go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

1857
01:23:57.601 --> 01:23:59.350
<v Speaker 3>but actually it might not have been raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1858
01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.770
<v Speaker 3>When did they start pasteurizing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>modernization?</v>

1859
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Speaker 3>The jamie thing that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1860
01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:10.430
<v Speaker 3>louis pester best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is who it was a realization,</v>

1861
01:24:10.431 --> 01:24:11.160
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1862
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.740
<v Speaker 3>that's what it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Past Louis pasteurized milk.</v>

1863
01:24:13.890 --> 01:24:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did they start implementing that?</v>

1864
01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Like when you would get the milk on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>door and those glass jars.</v>

1865
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Didn't that milk go bad quick though?</v>

1866
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.831
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1867
01:24:21.831 --> 01:24:22.664
<v Speaker 4>my grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they would describe the </v>

1868
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:24.743
<v Speaker 4>milkman.</v>

1869
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.550
<v Speaker 3>18 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it started,</v>

1870
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:29.550
<v Speaker 3>that's when it started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder when it was common.</v>

1871
01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.193
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if</v>

1872
01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.730
<v Speaker 4>when you think about like market </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

1873
01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:33.564
<v Speaker 4>we always talk about an hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the turn of the century being this </v>

1874
01:24:35.761 --> 01:24:36.594
<v Speaker 4>huge moment in hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation market hunting really </v>

1875
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:45.150
<v Speaker 4>became a thing when when it accelerated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when refrigeration became a reality,</v>

1876
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.033
<v Speaker 4>right and accelerated when railroads </v>
<v Speaker 4>could take meat from the great american </v>

1877
01:24:49.231 --> 01:24:50.064
<v Speaker 4>west back to the cities in the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast and so those things like excel or </v>

1878
01:24:54.151 --> 01:24:54.984
<v Speaker 4>that technology and those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accelerated market hunting and the </v>

1879
01:24:57.690 --> 01:24:58.523
<v Speaker 4>depredation of things like the white </v>
<v Speaker 4>tail deer and and and the buffalo as we </v>

1880
01:25:01.921 --> 01:25:02.754
<v Speaker 4>all same.</v>

1881
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:04.263
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to flavor this and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>context of most people that hear these </v>

1882
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:10.360
<v Speaker 3>conversations don't really know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about.</v>

1883
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you.</v>

1884
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:14.740
<v Speaker 3>You're obviously well versed in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a lot of folks,</v>

1885
01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:19.741
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What haPpened was after the civil war in</v>

1886
01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of soldiers,</v>

1887
01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:22.984
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fighting anymore in the war</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they got jobs as hunters and they </v>

1888
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:30.380
<v Speaker 3>would just go out with no rules and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot as many animals as they wanted</v>

1889
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.283
<v Speaker 4>and we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The term we call that as market hunting </v>

1890
01:25:32.821 --> 01:25:33.654
<v Speaker 4>and their market hunting means that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're out hunting for marketing the </v>

1891
01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:38.664
<v Speaker 4>meat or marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hides of marketing parts of the </v>

1892
01:25:40.081 --> 01:25:41.580
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To them it's just the tongue.</v>

1893
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.820
<v Speaker 4>Which buffaloes for just the tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1894
01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.040
<v Speaker 4>So at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and are at the turn of the century,</v>

1895
01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:47.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>

1896
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:49.110
<v Speaker 4>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn of the century.</v>

1897
01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:53.850
<v Speaker 4>We had mass mass killings of people just</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of buffalo really?</v>

1898
01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.220
<v Speaker 4>But white tail deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mallard duck,</v>

1899
01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:57.060
<v Speaker 4>wild turkeys,</v>

1900
01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.020
<v Speaker 3>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk,</v>

1901
01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:00.360
<v Speaker 3>black bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black bear ever get that?</v>

1902
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1903
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at</v>

1904
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.873
<v Speaker 4>a photograph of like so many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals just hanging from these docks </v>

1905
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:10.380
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And mostly it looks like all ducks.</v>

1906
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't see anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing.</v>

1907
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.793
<v Speaker 4>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A whole.</v>

1908
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 4>What are those easter eggs like bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all ducks.</v>

1909
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1910
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:27.370
<v Speaker 4>so there's the market hunting deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they decimated massive quantities of</v>

1911
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:32.830
<v Speaker 4>these wild game and they were like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hair.</v>

1912
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.170
<v Speaker 4>There's more whites healthier today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when christopher columbus landed on</v>

1913
01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 4>this continent at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the turn of the century,</v>

1914
01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:43.400
<v Speaker 4>when at the height of the market on </v>
<v Speaker 4>crisis in this country,</v>

1915
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:46.610
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were enough,</v>

1916
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.473
<v Speaker 4>there were enough white tail deer that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably would have been on the </v>

1917
01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:54.971
<v Speaker 4>endangered species list or been close </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the model of conservation that we</v>

1918
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 4>then enacted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say like,</v>

1919
01:26:58.161 --> 01:27:00.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to overexerts approval.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of it,</v>

1920
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:02.390
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look up jamie,</v>

1921
01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:04.310
<v Speaker 4>the north american model of wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation,</v>

1922
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.190
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a ton of key figures in taking</v>

1923
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:11.053
<v Speaker 4>what America had at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was basically the wild west where </v>

1924
01:27:13.911 --> 01:27:17.750
<v Speaker 4>animals are dying at mass and with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with railroads and refrigeration.</v>

1925
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:18.583
<v Speaker 4>Like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tHey're then feeding and clothing at </v>

1926
01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 4>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The masses in the urban settings,</v>

1927
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:26.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New York and different places.</v>

1928
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 4>But as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the centuries turned over.</v>

1929
01:27:30.171 --> 01:27:31.004
<v Speaker 4>And did you get into the teens and </v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties guys like teddy roosevelt give </v>

1930
01:27:35.821 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 4>her pinochet there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know john [inaudible].</v>

1931
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:39.183
<v Speaker 4>There was a bunch of figures who </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially kicked off what is american </v>

1932
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:44.954
<v Speaker 4>conservation movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movement to conserve not only the </v>

1933
01:27:48.711 --> 01:27:49.544
<v Speaker 4>wildlife populations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wildlands in wild waters and </v>

1934
01:27:52.241 --> 01:27:53.074
<v Speaker 4>significant places in this country that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we needed to protect because around the </v>

1935
01:27:56.511 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 4>turn of the century we did not have that</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling of value as a society.</v>

1936
01:28:00.711 --> 01:28:01.544
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't a like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to go value that thing we've </v>

1937
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:04.670
<v Speaker 4>never seen because you could never see </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1938
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we,</v>

1939
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went,</v>

1940
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.430
<v Speaker 4>they set about building a value </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure for not only wildlife but wild</v>

1941
01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:14.264
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>

1942
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.560
<v Speaker 4>And they also said about a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1943
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:22.030
<v Speaker 4>a way that the user would pay for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation and this,</v>

1944
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:23.624
<v Speaker 4>these are the constructs of what we now </v>
<v Speaker 4>know to be the north american model of </v>

1945
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 4>wildlife conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1946
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1947
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.430
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like one of the most successful and</v>

1948
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.560
<v Speaker 4>like the seminal systems of conservation</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world in the world.</v>

1949
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.473
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't reallY codified until the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eighties until guys like larry is dr </v>

1950
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 4>boulerice geist and shane mahoney and </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks wrote it down and said,</v>

1951
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:46.610
<v Speaker 4>this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But pull it,</v>

1952
01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:47.523
<v Speaker 4>if you could pull up the tenants of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>north american model because I can list </v>

1953
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:51.974
<v Speaker 4>them off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but north american model of wildlife </v>

1954
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 4>conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife as public trust resources,</v>

1955
01:28:57.530 --> 01:29:00.440
<v Speaker 4>elimination of markets for game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's what people say,</v>

1956
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can I buy some elk?</v>

1957
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>You can</v>

1958
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.160
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy from zealand.</v>

1959
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:06.683
<v Speaker 1>Wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wildlife is a public trust that just </v>

1960
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>basically means the states hold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife and trust for the public.</v>

1961
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.673
<v Speaker 1>these animals belong to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>STate holds them in trust and manage </v>

1962
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Speaker 1>them in interest for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1963
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:19.464
<v Speaker 1>for people that have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as an idea that we would own a </v>

1964
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.364
<v Speaker 1>living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason for that is to protect </v>

1965
01:29:26.731 --> 01:29:30.090
<v Speaker 1>those living things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand on semantics that you would</v>

1966
01:29:30.091 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>have issue with either humans shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>

1967
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't and maybe own is the wrong word</v>

1968
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe owned is the wrong word to use,</v>

1969
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's like manage and cohabitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1970
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the better way to say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>by being by looks.</v>

1971
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Whether we protect them or whether we </v>
<v Speaker 1>decimate them.</v>

1972
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the stewards of the land,</v>

1973
01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.450
<v Speaker 1>but we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the ones,</v>

1974
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the monkeYs with the guns.</v>

1975
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 1>That's just if we have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1976
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 1>here's this number of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this number of land,</v>

1977
01:29:58.591 --> 01:30:00.510
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how we encourage upon that land.</v>

1978
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's study that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that's all good.</v>

1979
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:04.183
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's manage It as actively </v>

1980
01:30:05.911 --> 01:30:06.744
<v Speaker 1>managed as hunters and anglers to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure the carrying capacity of this land </v>

1981
01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:13.650
<v Speaker 1>meets the wildlife populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is working in order to.</v>

1982
01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the sustainable use of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>

1983
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what hunting is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody asks you like,</v>

1984
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:19.680
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

1985
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:20.543
<v Speaker 1>what's hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say hunting in the north american </v>

1986
01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 1>model is the sustainable use of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>

1987
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To eat,</v>

1988
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.520
<v Speaker 1>to eat elimination,</v>

1989
01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.710
<v Speaker 3>have markets for game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We covered,</v>

1990
01:30:30.711 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 3>covered none of these animals that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1991
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:36.750
<v Speaker 3>whether you're eating black bear or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether eating deer,</v>

1992
01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.790
<v Speaker 3>you cannot buy that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you buy it,</v>

1993
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Farm,</v>

1994
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:43.590
<v Speaker 3>raised meat and most of it is from New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand.</v>

1995
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allocation of wildlife by law,</v>

1996
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's laws,</v>

1997
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.863
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a law to say how many animals </v>

1998
01:30:51.061 --> 01:30:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you can kill if you just like that fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Missouri.</v>

1999
01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:54.714
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch bambi if you kill more than we're </v>

2000
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:57.990
<v Speaker 1>supposed to kill your approach now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've broken the law</v>

2001
01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:58.873
<v Speaker 3>and the law is dictated and most really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good states like Montana by wildlife </v>

2002
01:31:03.861 --> 01:31:04.694
<v Speaker 3>biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservationists and people that </v>

2003
01:31:06.831 --> 01:31:10.760
<v Speaker 3>understand the population and what's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy population for the area.</v>

2004
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how to maintain a correct balance.</v>

2005
01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.610
<v Speaker 3>And there's a real science to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

2006
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:17.571
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2007
01:31:17.571 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>the science of when you talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife biologists about this,</v>

2008
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:21.390
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2009
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:24.410
<v Speaker 3>we had a great podcast with doug during </v>
<v Speaker 3>brian.</v>

2010
01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Brian's last name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love doug.</v>

2011
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Darren was a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't remember my shitty brain.</v>

2012
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

2013
01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.650
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about cwd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic wasting disease,</v>

2014
01:31:36.651 --> 01:31:40.460
<v Speaker 3>the spread of it amongst wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just richard's Brian Richards.</v>

2015
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Shout out to Brian Richards and me pal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doug,</v>

2016
01:31:43.101 --> 01:31:44.640
<v Speaker 3>darren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doug,</v>

2017
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:47.720
<v Speaker 3>great dogs the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep fighting that fight over there.</v>

2018
01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.033
<v Speaker 3>So what we talked about was the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>science behind this one particular </v>

2019
01:31:54.201 --> 01:31:56.540
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you grow to appreciate when you hear</v>

2020
01:31:56.541 --> 01:31:57.374
<v Speaker 3>someone like him talk the grow to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the complex nature of </v>

2021
01:32:00.041 --> 01:32:04.550
<v Speaker 3>wildlife biology and maintaining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations of animals,</v>

2022
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 3>keeping keeping them healthy and making </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that these habitats are preserved.</v>

2023
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:09.850
<v Speaker 3>This is very complicated.</v>

2024
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2025
01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.753
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to really understand the</v>
<v Speaker 4>scope of these to take Wyoming or </v>

2026
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2027
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.920
<v Speaker 4>we Tend to cordon off things we really </v>
<v Speaker 4>care about like,</v>

2028
01:32:20.921 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears in the greater yellowstone</v>

2029
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 4>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really care about that.</v>

2030
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:24.874
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really what we should talk about is </v>

2031
01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:32.490
<v Speaker 4>really what most wildlife managers are </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at is just like biodiversity and</v>

2032
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 4>health of all wildlife populations and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it predator prey,</v>

2033
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.270
<v Speaker 4>predator prey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>balance.</v>

2034
01:32:38.271 --> 01:32:39.104
<v Speaker 4>Like these are things that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've set about in this model of </v>

2035
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:46.080
<v Speaker 4>conservation to say like we're not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>by license,</v>

2036
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:46.923
<v Speaker 4>by license.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are using science and biology to </v>

2037
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.000
<v Speaker 4>dictate the way in which hunting is used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to benefit these populations back.</v>

2038
01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:55.923
<v Speaker 4>OH,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gone,</v>

2039
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 3>jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Googling porn.</v>

2040
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:02.980
<v Speaker 3>A wildlife can only be killed for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate purpose.</v>

2041
01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 3>That kind of says it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

2042
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:05.974
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean is where it gets </v>

2043
01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:09.030
<v Speaker 3>weird when people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2044
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:12.910
<v Speaker 3>here's one goes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get really crazy.</v>

2045
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.190
<v Speaker 3>They'll get really crazy when you kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

2046
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:17.623
<v Speaker 3>Even if you can eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was looking at Adam Green trees </v>

2047
01:33:19.871 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 3>page and braintree shot a cougar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he send you that?</v>

2048
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.063
<v Speaker 3>He has not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be here and we're gonna </v>

2049
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 3>cook it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2050
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Going to cook some mountain lion</v>

2051
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I hear till it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had.</v>

2052
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:32.960
<v Speaker 4>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had it like that.</v>

2053
01:33:32.961 --> 01:33:34.410
<v Speaker 4>I've shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But somebody else prepared.</v>

2054
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Would you say you hear tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have had.</v>

2055
01:33:36.201 --> 01:33:38.530
<v Speaker 4>I have had it and it is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you being coy?</v>

2056
01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Being coy at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear.</v>

2057
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I like to sound folksy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people are saying what I'm saying,</v>

2058
01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.630
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2059
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2060
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:49.640
<v Speaker 4>it's like lean and delicate and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>like pork almost.</v>

2061
01:33:49.641 --> 01:33:50.474
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>

2062
01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.770
<v Speaker 3>And then people will go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why are you killing that?</v>

2063
01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.773
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand how fucked it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have zero problem with someone </v>

2064
01:33:58.671 --> 01:34:01.580
<v Speaker 3>killing a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have a problem,</v>

2065
01:34:01.581 --> 01:34:02.414
<v Speaker 3>someone killing a mountain lion and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a real problem with someone killing </v>

2066
01:34:05.391 --> 01:34:10.160
<v Speaker 3>something that will fucking kill you if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it catches you alone in the forest.</v>

2067
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking for sure.</v>

2068
01:34:11.331 --> 01:34:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Kill your dog for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill your kids.</v>

2069
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:14.743
<v Speaker 3>Definitely killed those cute little deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill a shitload of them like one </v>

2070
01:34:18.651 --> 01:34:19.484
<v Speaker 3>every couple of days for its entire life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wherever they're experts at it and </v>

2071
01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.450
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason we get it in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>head that if,</v>

2072
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:30.320
<v Speaker 3>and I think this comes from this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of trophy hunting,</v>

2073
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:31.563
<v Speaker 3>that if you kill something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only killing that thing because </v>

2074
01:34:34.371 --> 01:34:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you have a little dick and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2075
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.473
<v Speaker 3>You going to be a big man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you killed this thing that's better </v>

2076
01:34:39.831 --> 01:34:40.664
<v Speaker 3>than you in this beautiful animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The definition of a surface level </v>

2077
01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.560
<v Speaker 3>examination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2078
01:34:45.561 --> 01:34:49.640
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't because this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the narrative that's been pushed</v>

2079
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.710
<v Speaker 3>through all the channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

2080
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:55.820
<v Speaker 3>unless they go out and research this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff objective in depth.</v>

2081
01:34:55.821 --> 01:34:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And why would you they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be,</v>

2082
01:34:58.390 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 1>let's be devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>

2083
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're an accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want to look into?</v>

2084
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:05.180
<v Speaker 1>The subtleties of predator hunting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to keep that up,</v>

2085
01:35:05.181 --> 01:35:06.000
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2086
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Why do I want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2087
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:07.694
<v Speaker 1>Why do I give a fuck about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't we get some assholes </v>

2088
01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:11.510
<v Speaker 1>wants to shoot mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crazy.</v>

2089
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Always good to use dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

2090
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That's so unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk for.</v>

2091
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Can we talk for a minute about baiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears?</v>

2092
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With it's,</v>

2093
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.790
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to keep legitimate purpose.</v>

2094
01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep legitimate purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2095
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:26.270
<v Speaker 1>But I read if you want to keep that down</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the light,</v>

2096
01:35:26.271 --> 01:35:28.780
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just paid it back up when we need it.</v>

2097
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:29.810
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2098
01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2099
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.633
<v Speaker 1>I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read stories and you and I baited </v>

2100
01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WenT hunting for bears baited before.</v>

2101
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And so I've heard a lot of in hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the term fair chase,</v>

2102
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:45.791
<v Speaker 1>which means a legitimate reason for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability for the to escape.</v>

2103
01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.600
<v Speaker 1>You're hunting the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all fairness,</v>

2104
01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.820
<v Speaker 1>in the pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2105
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:53.660
<v Speaker 1>people beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up on bated bear hunting a lot,</v>

2106
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.613
<v Speaker 1>probably because bears are involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably because it seems unfair to sit </v>

2107
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:03.560
<v Speaker 1>in a chair and put out some donuts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>put out some,</v>

2108
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead beaver put out whatever attracts a </v>

2109
01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:10.810
<v Speaker 1>bear to put a smell out into the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear smells it,</v>

2110
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it comes to eat and you're there to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2111
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 1>That seems like what lazy seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems a lot of cheating.</v>

2112
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people would say that's not fair.</v>

2113
01:36:20.451 --> 01:36:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Chase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical.</v>

2114
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2115
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and in some ways I agree with that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to other ways of hunting,</v>

2116
01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I can say,</v>

2117
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:28.664
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no more ethical if the idea is </v>

2118
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:33.950
<v Speaker 1>to kill the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the right animal,</v>

2119
01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 1>especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bear hunting,</v>

2120
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to kill a specific bore.</v>

2121
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 1>A male bear that is pass holder past </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding.</v>

2122
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's bear hunting will tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the hardest things to judge on,</v>

2123
01:36:46.791 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>it's on while it's living is a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a male or a female,</v>

2124
01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 1>how big it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old it is.</v>

2125
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.340
<v Speaker 1>They are hard to judge because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

2126
01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.630
<v Speaker 1>They they slide through the forest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look that they don't stay.</v>

2127
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.873
<v Speaker 1>There's no markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if the bear is standing next to a </v>

2128
01:37:03.231 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 1>volkswagen bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2130
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:07.160
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how big a bug is.</v>

2131
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big the bears.</v>

2132
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:10.480
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear is nexus and treat.</v>

2133
01:37:10.481 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really can't tell.</v>

2134
01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So spotting and stalking.</v>

2135
01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Well we call spotting and stalking </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes like walking around,</v>

2136
01:37:16.941 --> 01:37:19.010
<v Speaker 1>trying to find a better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it far away and getting close</v>

2137
01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:19.640
<v Speaker 1>enough to kill it.</v>

2138
01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's with a rifle or bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems with what </v>

2139
01:37:24.021 --> 01:37:27.740
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a fair way to it to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of that animal.</v>

2140
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of problems around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're hard to judge.</v>

2141
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:32.203
<v Speaker 1>You could come up on a sow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a female bear that has cubs in a bush </v>

2142
01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:38.570
<v Speaker 1>and he not see the cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not know that it's a sow.</v>

2143
01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 1>You're far away with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You crack,</v>

2144
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To culture and out of the bush,</v>

2145
01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.140
<v Speaker 1>that is not what you were trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made a mistake there.</v>

2146
01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:49.730
<v Speaker 1>In the scenario where you are at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bait site is animal comes in,</v>

2147
01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:52.040
<v Speaker 1>it's walking around very close to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

2148
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>You get to judge it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to look between its legs,</v>

2149
01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:00.360
<v Speaker 4>see if it has a dick or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then just determined it's the animal</v>

2150
01:38:00.361 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 4>you want to dispatch and dispatch it </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethically because it's closer to you.</v>

2151
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 4>It's 20 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stabilized.</v>

2152
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:07.643
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times it doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully doesn't know you're there </v>

2153
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:13.080
<v Speaker 4>rather than doing it from further away </v>
<v Speaker 4>or having to stock close to it.</v>

2154
01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 4>So I say all this to say like this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex.</v>

2155
01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.573
<v Speaker 4>What you think might be fair chase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you think you might want to apply </v>

2156
01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:21.534
<v Speaker 4>your own levels of fairness to doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>always equal the reality of pursuing </v>

2157
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 4>that animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the end game is to dispatch it fairly</v>

2158
01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:30.270
<v Speaker 4>and kill it fairly,</v>

2159
01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:31.683
<v Speaker 3>bears are a very unique animal in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much more criticism because </v>

2160
01:38:36.101 --> 01:38:41.080
<v Speaker 3>of teddy bears and yogi and fucking coca</v>
<v Speaker 3>cola commercials.</v>

2161
01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:43.180
<v Speaker 3>We have this idea of what a bear is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2162
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:44.223
<v Speaker 3>and it's also the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is hard for people to accept </v>

2163
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:54.340
<v Speaker 3>those old bores that were trying to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2164
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.233
<v Speaker 3>If you kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better for the whole population of </v>

2165
01:38:57.071 --> 01:38:59.500
<v Speaker 3>bears because they eat bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2166
01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:02.110
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2167
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend jonathan who is a,</v>

2168
01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you met john and jen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2169
01:39:08.231 --> 01:39:09.340
<v Speaker 3>we were up there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>JonaThan,</v>

2170
01:39:09.341 --> 01:39:10.174
<v Speaker 3>their son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw one of the bears kill and start </v>

2171
01:39:13.631 --> 01:39:17.890
<v Speaker 3>consuming a cub female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scared the bear off.</v>

2172
01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:19.270
<v Speaker 3>And then eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her own kid.</v>

2173
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to</v>

2174
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:21.280
<v Speaker 4>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2175
01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.230
<v Speaker 4>a guy named cole kramer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I've hunted on kodiak island with.</v>

2176
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:29.390
<v Speaker 4>He seen bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he seen male bears chase down,</v>

2177
01:39:29.391 --> 01:39:30.224
<v Speaker 4>sal's run them into a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rip him and he's watched them rip cubs </v>

2178
01:39:33.771 --> 01:39:37.780
<v Speaker 4>and rip them in half and eat them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spit them out like you know.</v>

2179
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.340
<v Speaker 4>And once you've seen That you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2180
01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:41.853
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how many bear cartoons we </v>

2181
01:39:43.011 --> 01:39:43.844
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how many times a bear has </v>

2182
01:39:44.941 --> 01:39:45.651
<v Speaker 4>suspenders on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2183
01:39:45.651 --> 01:39:46.484
<v Speaker 4>is talking to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't change no matter how many </v>

2184
01:39:48.081 --> 01:39:48.914
<v Speaker 4>times we name a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't change the bareness of the </v>

2185
01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:53.480
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't change.</v>

2186
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:54.383
<v Speaker 4>It's prime,</v>

2187
01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.500
<v Speaker 3>different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of animal.</v>

2188
01:39:56.650 --> 01:39:59.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's nothing we can do to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear being a bear.</v>

2189
01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't eat their own kids either.</v>

2190
01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2191
01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2192
01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.630
<v Speaker 4>somebody way more educated me can tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>you exactly what's happening there,</v>

2193
01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:12.350
<v Speaker 4>but we know you and I both know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're killing those two.</v>

2194
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.360
<v Speaker 4>They're kiLling as many clubs as I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get this out,</v>

2195
01:40:14.361 --> 01:40:14.730
<v Speaker 4>to come back</v>

2196
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:15.563
<v Speaker 3>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing that and they're also </v>

2197
01:40:16.251 --> 01:40:17.780
<v Speaker 3>doing it for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Food as well.</v>

2198
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:20.990
<v Speaker 3>They eat them and they also try to bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>the saddleback and astro.</v>

2199
01:40:20.991 --> 01:40:23.180
<v Speaker 3>So your thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about this before.</v>

2200
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Hunters are in a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2201
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:26.663
<v Speaker 4>are in a really interesting position to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have seen to see these things and be </v>

2202
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 4>intimate with these animals,</v>

2203
01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:36.070
<v Speaker 3>which is if you just explain what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to most people,</v>

2204
01:40:36.071 --> 01:40:38.770
<v Speaker 3>they would just snap head back like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2205
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:41.890
<v Speaker 3>They're cannibals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent of them are cannibals.</v>

2206
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the ones that were suspended.</v>

2207
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:47.180
<v Speaker 4>It is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this.</v>

2208
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I think what nonhunters want from </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters is,</v>

2209
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:52.820
<v Speaker 4>is to one say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2210
01:40:52.821 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 4>this a complex thing that we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2211
01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:57.310
<v Speaker 4>We're going into a wild place and </v>
<v Speaker 4>removing from.</v>

2212
01:40:57.311 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 4>It's something we didn't put there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that serIous.</v>

2213
01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 4>But that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't be nonchalant about that.</v>

2214
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't celebrate it in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it seem irreverent like that.</v>

2215
01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:07.323
<v Speaker 4>That we should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should understand it's serious and </v>

2216
01:41:10.361 --> 01:41:12.760
<v Speaker 4>take that action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

2217
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:14.103
<v Speaker 4>We should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know again that guy do sean and he </v>

2218
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 4>was explaining and checklists of ikea to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go hunting.</v>

2219
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:20.704
<v Speaker 4>You had to go take a class and learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>flora and fauna and learn how many </v>

2220
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 4>pheasant eggs were in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a nest.</v>

2221
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:27.220
<v Speaker 4>And in real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:41:27.221 --> 01:41:31.510
<v Speaker 4>And then once you became a hunter in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms that they describe it,</v>

2223
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:32.973
<v Speaker 4>then you had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the amount of work you put into </v>

2224
01:41:34.691 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 4>the forest that denote and what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could then hunt.</v>

2225
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.833
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you went to cut down this many </v>

2226
01:41:39.821 --> 01:41:42.880
<v Speaker 4>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could go hunt a deer if you only did</v>

2227
01:41:42.881 --> 01:41:44.580
<v Speaker 4>one certain thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could hunter rabbit,</v>

2228
01:41:44.581 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 4>like they had this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2229
01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 4>he describes it as this like interaction</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2230
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:49.443
<v Speaker 4>So that was the model that was her model</v>
<v Speaker 4>of conservation was very much like </v>

2231
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:56.470
<v Speaker 4>accountability and so I think what most </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonhunters want from hunters because for</v>

2232
01:41:56.471 --> 01:41:59.200
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think about anti hunters as much</v>

2233
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.480
<v Speaker 4>as i think about somebody who just is </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart,</v>

2234
01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.970
<v Speaker 4>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's never been.</v>

2235
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:04.923
<v Speaker 4>You were this way at some point you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like person who really thought hard </v>

2236
01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:13.681
<v Speaker 4>about what you were eating and wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>explore what is happening here.</v>

2237
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Is there alternative ways?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think what non went from hunters is</v>

2238
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:21.340
<v Speaker 4>for us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2239
01:42:21.341 --> 01:42:22.174
<v Speaker 4>we get it complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get it's a serious thing and we're </v>

2240
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:29.941
<v Speaker 4>doing our best to unpack the moral and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethical entanglements in what we do.</v>

2241
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2242
01:42:32.401 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2243
01:42:33.791 --> 01:42:38.791
<v Speaker 4>we flush pheasants when we could shoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>them on the ground and that's the way we</v>

2244
01:42:39.431 --> 01:42:40.264
<v Speaker 4>do what we call that fair chase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't like when an animal comes </v>

2245
01:42:44.411 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 4>close enough to us and eats the corn </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can shoot it.</v>

2246
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't like that either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these,</v>

2247
01:42:48.241 --> 01:42:51.310
<v Speaker 4>these things are entangled there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to.</v>

2248
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard activity.</v>

2249
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:56.540
<v Speaker 4>Two to reckon with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the baiting part of it is,</v>

2250
01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:00.610
<v Speaker 4>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely not as good.</v>

2251
01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:01.923
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I'm out there bait and </v>

2252
01:43:03.011 --> 01:43:03.844
<v Speaker 4>every animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying I could just see as </v>

2253
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:07.143
<v Speaker 4>somebody who likes the nuance of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and likes to explore this and likes to </v>

2254
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.680
<v Speaker 4>ask why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

2255
01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.300
<v Speaker 4>why is it that that's the case?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it,</v>

2256
01:43:14.301 --> 01:43:17.890
<v Speaker 4>do we look down on people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bait animals and board use dogs.</v>

2257
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Nobody use dogs to st.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same reason.</v>

2258
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:20.973
<v Speaker 4>They do it for the exact same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they get a close up ethical shot on </v>

2259
01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.960
<v Speaker 4>the difficult to pursue an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:43:25.961 --> 01:43:26.794
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it always goes back to like the reasons </v>

2261
01:43:28.421 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Speaker 4>we do what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

2262
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:30.931
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2263
01:43:30.931 --> 01:43:32.380
<v Speaker 4>I would hope that everybody listening to</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2264
01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:34.310
<v Speaker 4>lots of people do that don't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would,</v>

2265
01:43:34.311 --> 01:43:35.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would ask themselves like,</v>

2266
01:43:35.411 --> 01:43:37.420
<v Speaker 4>what do I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I expect from hunters?</v>

2267
01:43:38.050 --> 01:43:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Like what is the thing that I expect you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do to earn?</v>

2268
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.130
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I very much feel is 100.</v>

2269
01:43:42.131 --> 01:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I need to earn the respect of the non </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred.</v>

2270
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a duty to my hunting community to</v>

2271
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.610
<v Speaker 4>actively earn the respect of every 900 I</v>
<v Speaker 4>run into.</v>

2272
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I got to do it and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2273
01:43:55.551 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm just making it harder for </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

2274
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's,</v>

2275
01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 4>it's an almost impossible task.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've done.</v>

2276
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 4>you've probably done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done it on a one to one level.</v>

2277
01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely have flipped people </v>

2278
01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.300
<v Speaker 3>especially easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier.</v>

2279
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:15.150
<v Speaker 3>It's much easier when they eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We eat meat.</v>

2280
01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.290
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2281
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.540
<v Speaker 3>But then they'll still have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the bear thing.</v>

2282
01:44:18.541 --> 01:44:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And the bear thing is when you got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit them down with like,</v>

2283
01:44:20.371 --> 01:44:23.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't prefer to hunt bears.</v>

2284
01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't in any way because I don't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirded out about tricking gnosis.</v>

2285
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just the meat is not as good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

2286
01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:33.323
<v Speaker 3>It tastes great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a nice roast or bear stir fry </v>

2287
01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.050
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is delicious.</v>

2288
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:40.090
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like you spit it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not also comparative to elac.</v>

2289
01:44:40.091 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2290
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even have it medium rare,</v>

2291
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 3>which is the best way to eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2292
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.163
<v Speaker 3>So it's not the same to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I lived like an alberta where </v>

2293
01:44:49.521 --> 01:44:52.100
<v Speaker 3>john and jen live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would realize that it's imperative you</v>

2294
01:44:52.101 --> 01:44:56.300
<v Speaker 3>have to do and if you do like detail and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do like to eat deer and if you do</v>

2295
01:44:56.301 --> 01:44:59.210
<v Speaker 3>like deep moose is really your </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to hunt bear.</v>

2296
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they kill 50 percent of all the </v>

2297
01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:05.960
<v Speaker 3>moose calves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the calves and the deer fauns 50 percent</v>

2298
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.710
<v Speaker 3>get killed by black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the other thIng.</v>

2299
01:45:09.711 --> 01:45:10.544
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's because nature has bounce </v>

2300
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:13.183
<v Speaker 3>and the reason why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those fucking Deer don't look at </v>

2301
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.300
<v Speaker 3>those kangaroo in that park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's true too.</v>

2302
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:18.523
<v Speaker 3>That's true to the right and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's our job to not have any sort of </v>

2303
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 3>bias when it comes to our examination of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this information,</v>

2304
01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:28.904
<v Speaker 3>whether it's flattering or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to be able to look at this </v>

2305
01:45:30.861 --> 01:45:32.570
<v Speaker 3>subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ain't got to be pragmatic.</v>

2306
01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>

2307
01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 3>and you have to be honest and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

2308
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.453
<v Speaker 3>You'll have to address the complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to realize that this is very </v>

2309
01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:42.590
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

2310
01:45:42.591 --> 01:45:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wear a leather shoes,</v>

2311
01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:44.954
<v Speaker 3>you got clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a leather interior in your car </v>

2312
01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:49.550
<v Speaker 3>eating cheeseburgers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should probably shut the fuck up.</v>

2313
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:52.810
<v Speaker 4>we're human consumption engines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We breathe in and breathe out.</v>

2314
01:45:52.811 --> 01:45:53.644
<v Speaker 4>We consume the world around us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way it works as you always </v>

2315
01:45:55.301 --> 01:45:56.134
<v Speaker 4>say life is life and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality of the situation for me </v>

2316
01:45:59.411 --> 01:46:00.244
<v Speaker 4>is like I've tried to not stray away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from but try to add onto the pragmatic </v>

2317
01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:09.850
<v Speaker 4>arguments for hunting to try to examine </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the emotional issues we have around</v>

2318
01:46:09.851 --> 01:46:13.030
<v Speaker 4>caring for the single animal over caring</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the entire species of,</v>

2319
01:46:13.110 --> 01:46:16.120
<v Speaker 4>of that animal or in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subspecies of that like that.</v>

2320
01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:18.310
<v Speaker 4>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somethiNg I've tried to add on,</v>

2321
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.440
<v Speaker 4>like let's first start with praGmatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments.</v>

2322
01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:22.870
<v Speaker 4>Like you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking killing things.</v>

2323
01:46:22.871 --> 01:46:27.871
<v Speaker 4>Like why aren't you thinking this hard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As I'm thinking about this and in a.</v>

2324
01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:31.510
<v Speaker 4>I really would love to build a bridge </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people to say I care.</v>

2325
01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.493
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you're an anti hunter and you </v>

2326
01:46:36.251 --> 01:46:37.400
<v Speaker 4>love animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a vegan,</v>

2327
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.080
<v Speaker 4>you a lot of conversation about b and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a v,</v>

2328
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.540
<v Speaker 4>I really care about animals are sentient</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>

2329
01:46:43.541 --> 01:46:44.374
<v Speaker 4>They all deserve life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put that person in front of me and then </v>

2330
01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I'll stand right beside them and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2331
01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I fucking</v>

2332
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.960
<v Speaker 1>agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that all animals are sent to you</v>

2333
01:46:52.961 --> 01:46:55.860
<v Speaker 1>at beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that they all deserve life and I</v>

2334
01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.440
<v Speaker 1>and then I go to preserve that life for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that animal.</v>

2335
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.640
<v Speaker 1>that's what I go to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start me in that anti hunter.</v>

2336
01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:03.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start at the same point and then over </v>

2337
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:11.421
<v Speaker 1>the years board of sword that it's those</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals I do so that that eliminates you</v>

2338
01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:16.510
<v Speaker 1>from their side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that instantly,</v>

2339
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.020
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your diet,</v>

2340
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:20.723
<v Speaker 1>but you're an animal consuming machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person's the animal consumer </v>

2341
01:47:23.641 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TheY're just not admitting it.</v>

2342
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.553
<v Speaker 1>They just don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't understand it mean </v>

2343
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:28.590
<v Speaker 1>machine because they don't organically </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

2344
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they organically gardened and neat,</v>

2345
01:47:30.631 --> 01:47:31.464
<v Speaker 1>everythIng that they grow themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even then it's hard to detach yourself </v>

2346
01:47:33.931 --> 01:47:35.870
<v Speaker 1>from your consumption of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard.</v>

2347
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in your compost,</v>

2348
01:47:37.601 --> 01:47:38.220
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

2349
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2350
01:47:39.521 --> 01:47:40.354
<v Speaker 1>it makes it easier for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just leave the vegan out of the </v>

2351
01:47:41.821 --> 01:47:43.620
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the non hunter is like,</v>

2352
01:47:43.730 --> 01:47:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't kill animals myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I care about them.</v>

2353
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about them and I kill him.</v>

2354
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:49.043
<v Speaker 1>Were at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you removed the second part of </v>

2355
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 1>the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first part is I care about them,</v>

2356
01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:54.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both care about animals.</v>

2357
01:47:54.091 --> 01:47:56.280
<v Speaker 1>We're standing at one point and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2358
01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:01.520
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mass media or just the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting has been marketed in the poor pr</v>

2359
01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:02.934
<v Speaker 1>agent that we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of walked away from each </v>

2360
01:48:04.681 --> 01:48:05.491
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2361
01:48:05.491 --> 01:48:06.324
<v Speaker 1>We started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both care about animals that we've </v>

2362
01:48:07.471 --> 01:48:08.304
<v Speaker 1>kind of walked away from each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over time we've been unwilling to turn </v>

2363
01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 1>around and face each other and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when we started out thinking we</v>

2364
01:48:16.081 --> 01:48:18.480
<v Speaker 1>all value these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we value their lives,</v>

2365
01:48:18.481 --> 01:48:19.440
<v Speaker 1>we all care about them.</v>

2366
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Hunting is just a version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our version and it's worked.</v>

2367
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.380
<v Speaker 1>given that model of conservation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>

2368
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 1>it's worked for the white tail deer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mallard duck.</v>

2369
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more than ever.</v>

2370
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing it a different way than,</v>

2371
01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:35.233
<v Speaker 1>than you've chosen to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it in a more proactive way </v>

2372
01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 1>than you've chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2373
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:43.570
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would,</v>

2374
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:45.060
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a vet came up to me and be like,</v>

2375
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:45.894
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we have more similarities in my </v>

2376
01:48:48.001 --> 01:48:49.080
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we do differences.</v>

2377
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:53.310
<v Speaker 1>We've just chosen the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one big fat thing that's different.</v>

2378
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most important difference.</v>

2379
01:48:55.951 --> 01:48:56.784
<v Speaker 1>You want to kill animals need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think you should be allowed </v>

2380
01:48:58.590 --> 01:48:59.760
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think it's right.</v>

2381
01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't think it's moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think it's an ethical.</v>

2382
01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I just think everything is wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

2383
01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:08.850
<v Speaker 1>But we both care about animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a fucked up way to look at.</v>

2384
01:49:08.851 --> 01:49:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I care about people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like to eat them being great.</v>

2385
01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna.</v>

2386
01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Eat five people a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2387
01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you run for president and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2388
01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I really love people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like to eat them.</v>

2389
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a well there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are people.</v>

2390
01:49:21.091 --> 01:49:21.924
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that simple to tell </v>

2391
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you about animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

2392
01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by taking the lives of these few </v>

2393
01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on the full,</v>

2394
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 1>the full breadth of tell you if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cared,</v>

2395
01:49:35.551 --> 01:49:36.384
<v Speaker 1>you just donate the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just Donate the money to </v>

2396
01:49:38.191 --> 01:49:41.010
<v Speaker 1>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the pittman robertson act just,</v>

2397
01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm still feed my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making myself a better person.</v>

2398
01:49:44.821 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm still enriching my fucking life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't tell me I don't have the right</v>

2399
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:48.963
<v Speaker 3>to do that because you think animals are</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent to you and you're still killing </v>

2400
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:51.484
<v Speaker 3>animals by driving on roads and eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>corn and doing the things you're doing </v>

2401
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.680
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're not directly killing them by</v>

2402
01:49:56.681 --> 01:49:58.430
<v Speaker 3>their food choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2403
01:49:58.431 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>they don't know they are so into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proxy killing is better than than actual</v>

2404
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.800
<v Speaker 3>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well consciously,</v>

2405
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:06.641
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2406
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:07.474
<v Speaker 3>Actual consciously killing or buying </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's actually consciously </v>

2407
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 3>killed is different than if you buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you buy soy,</v>

2408
01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.170
<v Speaker 3>if you eat tofu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a fact,</v>

2409
01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:18.004
<v Speaker 3>and that fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a lot of animal </v>

2410
01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:23.860
<v Speaker 3>displacement in order to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of field available,</v>

2411
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:26.260
<v Speaker 3>to grow soy or to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow,</v>

2412
01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soybeans.</v>

2413
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Then it's just the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you talk to anybody that's</v>

2414
01:50:31.511 --> 01:50:32.344
<v Speaker 3>ever seen what happens when a crop gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit by a combine and then the vultures </v>

2415
01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:36.094
<v Speaker 3>start flying overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason it's because there was </v>

2416
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.253
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of little fucking squirrels and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbits and all sorts of shit that just </v>

2417
01:50:41.351 --> 01:50:42.184
<v Speaker 3>got ground up and anything else that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets stuck in that field as those </v>

2418
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:47.580
<v Speaker 3>gigantic machines come worrying by.</v>

2419
01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:48.413
<v Speaker 3>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how when you're talking about </v>

2420
01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:53.620
<v Speaker 3>large scale agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how things are harvested.</v>

2421
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not plucked one by one.</v>

2422
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:56.583
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're one of those people that has </v>

2423
01:50:58.751 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 3>an organic garden and you pluck one by </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2424
01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:02.173
<v Speaker 3>you take your rotten apple cores and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking orange peels and you throw it </v>

2425
01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:07.960
<v Speaker 3>all in a compost pile with some dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves.</v>

2426
01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:10.120
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you use that as fertilizer,</v>

2427
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:12.370
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run out of nitrogen </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you need fish.</v>

2428
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:13.204
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit switched from devil's advocate </v>

2429
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:19.360
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>

2430
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.940
<v Speaker 3>WheN you buy a fertilizer is dead fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2431
01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a fucking unusual cycle.</v>

2432
01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.473
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that cycle is that dead animals </v>

2433
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 3>actually fueled the plants that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume.</v>

2434
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:34.330
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a person that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2435
01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:36.720
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're eating wild plants right,</v>

2436
01:51:36.730 --> 01:51:37.563
<v Speaker 3>you want to eat some wild plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guarantees I'm dead fucking squirrels </v>

2437
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:43.150
<v Speaker 3>and rats and pigeons and anything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to fertilize,</v>

2438
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:43.984
<v Speaker 3>fertilize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably had that mean they've </v>

2439
01:51:45.731 --> 01:51:46.564
<v Speaker 3>proven that there's salmon dna sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>In plants because those plants have </v>

2440
01:51:51.191 --> 01:51:54.670
<v Speaker 3>actually used salmon for a fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people have used that,</v>

2441
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.060
<v Speaker 3>those dead fish and that shit gets into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the plants themselves.</v>

2442
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all.</v>

2443
01:51:58.901 --> 01:52:00.220
<v Speaker 3>It's all very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2444
01:52:00.221 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 3>There's no way out man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way out of this,</v>

2445
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:04.960
<v Speaker 3>but in their eyes even there was no way </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2446
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.823
<v Speaker 3>It's the out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the path of least pain and </v>

2447
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:09.090
<v Speaker 3>suffering and</v>

2448
01:52:09.090 --> 01:52:09.923
<v Speaker 4>I would tell those folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I respect the shit out of that and I'm </v>

2449
01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:13.853
<v Speaker 4>trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to take my own this into my </v>

2450
01:52:17.311 --> 01:52:18.144
<v Speaker 4>own hands and actively go and do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that I know to be enriching to my </v>

2451
01:52:20.911 --> 01:52:23.040
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make me a better person,</v>

2452
01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:24.173
<v Speaker 4>to make me a more skilled person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to give me more perspective on the </v>

2453
01:52:26.371 --> 01:52:27.870
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>

2454
01:52:27.871 --> 01:52:28.704
<v Speaker 4>the byproducts of all that activity is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier ecosystem and more more </v>

2455
01:52:32.881 --> 01:52:35.820
<v Speaker 4>wildlife because that's proven via the </v>
<v Speaker 4>model we've said,</v>

2456
01:52:35.821 --> 01:52:40.620
<v Speaker 4>and I feed my family with that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>just trying to do what you're doing in a</v>

2457
01:52:40.621 --> 01:52:41.454
<v Speaker 4>more tangible way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your hands off I'm hands on is the way </v>

2458
01:52:44.701 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>that I would say that and I respect</v>

2459
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:48.880
<v Speaker 2>the hands off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect like that.</v>

2460
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm cognizant of what's happening here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to make it better.</v>

2461
01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel what you're saying and I see what</v>

2462
01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:55.934
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm thinking through the eyes of </v>

2463
01:52:57.681 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 2>a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go fuck yourself.</v>

2464
01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm being the nice guy near him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dick floods like vegans.</v>

2465
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:09.551
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are dicks because wiling </v>
<v Speaker 2>net animals,</v>

2466
01:53:10.011 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you kill the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking asshole.</v>

2467
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:17.561
<v Speaker 2>You think you get a free to just kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and time you on or you don't.</v>

2468
01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:19.993
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like this devil's advocate side of </v>

2469
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

2470
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:22.783
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see my moby ever look at moby's </v>

2471
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:27.020
<v Speaker 2>page in every movie has a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram page.</v>

2472
01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Be something that was so preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day and I read the comments </v>

2473
01:53:31.641 --> 01:53:32.301
<v Speaker 2>under it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2474
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:36.410
<v Speaker 2>this is so hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eggs and this is what I mean.</v>

2475
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.483
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks of talking to a person who has </v>

2476
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:40.214
<v Speaker 2>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs are lIke the most karma free thing </v>

2477
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 2>says eggs cannot legally be labeled as </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

2478
01:53:45.411 --> 01:53:46.910
<v Speaker 2>nutritiouS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or safe to eat.</v>

2479
01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:48.373
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true because eggs are full of </v>

2480
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:53.780
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and saturated fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because every year over 100,000</v>

2481
01:53:53.781 --> 01:53:55.800
<v Speaker 2>people in the us contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to salmonella from exit.</v>

2482
01:53:55.801 --> 01:53:58.320
<v Speaker 2>They cannot legally be advertised as </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy or safe or nutritious.</v>

2483
01:53:59.060 --> 01:53:59.990
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's central.</v>

2484
01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you post that.</v>

2485
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:02.603
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you didn't look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something called animal </v>

2486
01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:09.200
<v Speaker 2>equality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people get salmonella from eggs</v>

2487
01:54:09.201 --> 01:54:11.710
<v Speaker 2>every year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it was 100,000</v>

2488
01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:12.544
<v Speaker 2>dollars to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be in the news would </v>

2489
01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:18.230
<v Speaker 2>collapsed so god damn fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's dismantle.</v>

2490
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go ahead and do that.</v>

2491
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Does dismantle this preposterous idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that 100,000</v>

2492
01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:26.660
<v Speaker 2>people get salmonella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2493
01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:29.450
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even with safety steps in place,</v>

2494
01:54:29.451 --> 01:54:34.451
<v Speaker 2>it is estimated that about one in 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one in 10,000</v>

2495
01:54:34.821 --> 01:54:38.090
<v Speaker 2>eggs are contaminated with salmonella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2496
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:41.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2497
01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:43.470
<v Speaker 2>What does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did he say?</v>

2498
01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.820
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get it.</v>

2499
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll see if you could find how many</v>

2500
01:54:48.661 --> 01:54:51.030
<v Speaker 2>people in the u s contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salmonella.</v>

2501
01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if they find out</v>

2502
01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:55.093
<v Speaker 2>that this salmonella and eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they finding out that's from </v>

2503
01:54:59.000 --> 01:54:59.833
<v Speaker 2>uncooked eggs every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About a million people get salmonella </v>

2504
01:55:03.921 --> 01:55:07.190
<v Speaker 2>infected from foods that had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated by one of the many kinds of</v>

2505
01:55:07.191 --> 01:55:09.280
<v Speaker 2>salmonella.</v>

<v Speaker 3>salmonella related deaths from 1990 to </v>

2531
01:56:36.421 --> 01:56:38.390
<v Speaker 3>2006.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now thanks moby.</v>

2533
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.243
<v Speaker 3>But this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking dummies are eating them </v>

2534
01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 3>raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I want you to google.</v>

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 3>How nutritious are eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about google this?</v>

2536
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.433
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>situational fucking life have never </v>

2537
01:56:51.841 --> 01:56:53.060
<v Speaker 3>gotten salmonella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

2538
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:54.300
<v Speaker 3>You're doing fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2539
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:56.670
<v Speaker 3>If you eat chicken raw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get salmonella to stupid.</v>

2540
01:56:56.970 --> 01:56:58.680
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to eat it raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I supposed to cook it.</v>

2541
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One egg has only 75 calories,</v>

2542
01:57:01.531 --> 01:57:04.530
<v Speaker 3>but seven grams of high quality protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five grams of fat,</v>

2543
01:57:04.531 --> 01:57:08.250
<v Speaker 3>and one point six grams of saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>along with iron vitamins,</v>

2544
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 3>minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and character carotinoids.</v>

2545
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:12.323
<v Speaker 3>The egg is a powerhouse of disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting nutrients like lutein and </v>

2546
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.270
<v Speaker 3>zeaxanthin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2547
01:57:18.271 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 3>mavi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So shut the fuck up.</v>

2548
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:22.110
<v Speaker 3>They're super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super nutritious for you.</v>

2549
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Just occasionally back off moby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody gets salmonella.</v>

2550
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:28.930

<v Speaker 3>a grow.</v>

2551
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.310
<v Speaker 3>But here's where it gets really dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you google this?</v>

2552
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:36.060
<v Speaker 3>How many people die every year from </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecolab?</v>

2553
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:37.470
<v Speaker 3>From vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2554
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Because a shitload anti corn is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>from farmed animals.</v>

2555
01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.180
<v Speaker 3>It's actually from agricultural runoff </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the.</v>

01:57:49.411 --> 01:57:51.060
<v Speaker 3>methane comes from vegans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli?</v>

2558
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:53.343

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

2567
01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Cdc estimates 260 265,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>infections occur each year in the United</v>

2568
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:23.070
<v Speaker 3>States of eco lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2569
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Thirty six percent are caused by </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] zero.</v>

2570
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:30.060
<v Speaker 3>One five or seven point eight slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

2571
01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:31.113
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost all from animal agriculture </v>

2572
01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:35.400
<v Speaker 3>is almost all from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from shit,</v>

2573
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:36.743
<v Speaker 3>from shit water types of ecolab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rosalind can be transmitted through </v>

2574
01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:42.300
<v Speaker 3>contaminated water or food to contract</v>

2575
01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:43.570
<v Speaker 2>with the animals or people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:58:43.571 --> 01:58:44.404
<v Speaker 2>But when they say contaminated water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they really mean is that water's </v>

2577
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.330
<v Speaker 2>contaminated with shit from animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

2578
01:58:49.331 --> 01:58:54.331

<v Speaker 2>common way to acquire e coli infection.</v>

2595

2620
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a lot of the store,</v>

2621
02:00:32.690 --> 02:00:37.690
<v Speaker 2>be honest with you to meet and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy meat from the store.</v>

2622
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

2623
02:00:39.221 --> 02:00:40.054
<v Speaker 2>I get to opt out of factory farming </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have a lot of wild game stuff </v>

2624
02:00:42.551 --> 02:00:44.380
<v Speaker 2>in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have definitely still bought meat from</v>

2625
02:00:44.381 --> 02:00:45.214
<v Speaker 2>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buy way less of it and I eat meat </v>

2626
02:00:47.981 --> 02:00:48.814
<v Speaker 2>almost every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll still go to a restaurant and </v>

2627
02:00:51.341 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 2>order a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2628
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:53.583

<v Speaker 2>attributing people probably heard </v>

2629
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:55.774
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the feeling of eating </v>

2630
02:00:56.561 --> 02:00:59.500
<v Speaker 2>while gaming is just different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way different.</v>

2631
02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:01.720
<v Speaker 2>It tastes different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better for you.</v>

2632
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It feels different.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when each one of his knees and he had </v>

2675
02:02:51.190 --> 02:02:53.830

<v Speaker 4>but it like he had clearly he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly in pain and like he just looked,</v>

<v Speaker 4>rundown.</v>

<v Speaker 3>didn't like that either he shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have said or maybe you didn't understand</v>

2687
02:03:22.931 --> 02:03:25.090
<v Speaker 3>what he meant or maybe it's out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

2688
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Anything that hurts anybody's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunate and donald support it.</v>

2689
02:03:28.511 --> 02:03:30.130
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all.</v>

2690
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:31.143
<v Speaker 3>We all have unfortunate things about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a fact of being a fucking </v>

2691
02:03:34.481 --> 02:03:36.430
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the parts.</v>

2692
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:37.623
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that we're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're screaming out and calling out </v>

2693
02:03:40.601 --> 02:03:44.470
<v Speaker 3>someone and we want someone deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>platformed and dismissed and never,</v>

2694
02:03:44.471 --> 02:03:45.304
<v Speaker 3>never to be heard from again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're worried we're part of us are </v>

2695
02:03:47.531 --> 02:03:49.240
<v Speaker 3>worried that that's going to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2696
02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:50.133
<v Speaker 3>We're worried that we would ever exhibit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of reprehensible behavior or </v>

2697
02:03:53.981 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>language and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wanna,</v>

2698
02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:59.650
<v Speaker 3>we wanna put a stop to it in ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and other people.</v>

2699
02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:00.693
<v Speaker 3>We want to eliminate it from our society</v>
<v Speaker 3>and culture and want to do it harshly </v>

2700
02:04:03.611 --> 02:04:06.160
<v Speaker 3>and ruthlessly and were terrified that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be done to us.</v>

2701
02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2702
02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:07.893
<v Speaker 3>and there's a Lot of people that make </v>
<v Speaker 3>some fucking really terrible mistakes </v>

2703
02:04:10.930 --> 02:04:15.130
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's gotta be some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a path to redemption.</v>

2704
02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2705
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:16.703
<v Speaker 3>really believed that</v>

2706
02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:18.850
<v Speaker 4>because I meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2707
02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:19.913
<v Speaker 4>in hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly don't meet the caliber of </v>

2708
02:04:21.421 --> 02:04:22.254
<v Speaker 4>folks that you have in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I meet these people in </v>

2709
02:04:23.731 --> 02:04:27.960
<v Speaker 4>huntington and I run around in circles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people are saying,</v>

2710
02:04:27.961 --> 02:04:30.420
<v Speaker 4>this person thinks this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And have you seen that instagram posts?</v>

2711
02:04:30.421 --> 02:04:32.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like knocking people down,</v>

2712
02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:34.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2713
02:04:35.370 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 4>I just think that I know that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good person,</v>

2714
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe he's not,</v>

2715
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.310
<v Speaker 4>he or she is not depicting this and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that you like it in this instance,</v>

2716
02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 4>but that's a good well meaning person.</v>

2717
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:48.353
<v Speaker 3>People are more than capable of mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we should be more than capable of </v>

2718
02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.510
<v Speaker 3>allowing them redemption and forgiveness</v>

2719
02:04:56.630 --> 02:04:58.570
<v Speaker 4>since we should want the same thing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2720
02:04:58.571 --> 02:04:59.404
<v Speaker 4>Should I be on this podcast right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have said something in the last </v>

2721
02:05:01.810 --> 02:05:02.920
<v Speaker 4>couple of hours that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was terrible.</v>

2722
02:05:02.921 --> 02:05:03.754
<v Speaker 4>And like I would hope the folks that </v>
<v Speaker 4>know Me would know that like this is a </v>

2723
02:05:06.671 --> 02:05:09.220
<v Speaker 4>mistake and as long as I own up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistake and say,</v>

2724
02:05:09.221 --> 02:05:10.600
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2725
02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:14.140
<v Speaker 4>it was in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I apologize a little bit of right brain,</v>

2726
02:05:14.170 --> 02:05:16.240
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but brain was going,</v>

2727
02:05:17.410 --> 02:05:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I apologize for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2728
02:05:18.730 --> 02:05:20.770
<v Speaker 4>for that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not.</v>

2729
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:21.663
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't define me because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very scare and slippery slope to get </v>

2730
02:05:24.761 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 4>down as like one moment in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't define.</v>

2731
02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2732
02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:30.840
<v Speaker 3>It's also something that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems way more recent,</v>

2733
02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:32.610
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that,</v>

2734
02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:33.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want someone to never be heard from </v>

2735
02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:35.604
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucked up and they should never be </v>

2736
02:05:37.381 --> 02:05:39.570
<v Speaker 3>heard from again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think,</v>

2737
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.433
<v Speaker 3>and this is my own bias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a product of a shitty way </v>

2738
02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.053
<v Speaker 3>of distributing information that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed all of our lives until recently </v>

2739
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:49.343
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like the long form </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is the only way to get to </v>

2740
02:05:52.861 --> 02:05:57.000
<v Speaker 3>know somebody and when you sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I saT down with ted after the three</v>

2741
02:05:57.001 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 3>hours talked to mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this guy.</v>

2742
02:05:58.620 --> 02:05:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I liked him.</v>

2743
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:00.011
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you say,</v>

2744
02:06:00.011 --> 02:06:03.100
<v Speaker 4>I love when I get off of a good podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

2745
02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:03.993
<v Speaker 4>when I was like an episode of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting collective and I sit down with </v>

2746
02:06:05.951 --> 02:06:07.210
<v Speaker 4>somebody and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

2747
02:06:07.211 --> 02:06:08.740
<v Speaker 4>this person is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2748
02:06:08.741 --> 02:06:10.480
<v Speaker 4>They just brought to my life in two </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2749
02:06:10.690 --> 02:06:12.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm so fucking happy to have had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2750
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:13.833
<v Speaker 4>it's like a high you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a legitimate high because you </v>

2751
02:06:15.641 --> 02:06:17.710
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say this all the time.</v>

2752
02:06:17.711 --> 02:06:18.544
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to sIt down in your life </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take two hours or three hours with </v>

2753
02:06:21.191 --> 02:06:22.024
<v Speaker 4>somebody in just talk and exchange ideas</v>
<v Speaker 4>and disagree and agree and no </v>

2754
02:06:25.091 --> 02:06:26.620
<v Speaker 4>distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no distractions,</v>

2755
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:29.280
<v Speaker 4>and that like what that gives you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2756
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:32.440
<v Speaker 4>if folks haven't done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that gives you something every,</v>

2757
02:06:32.441 --> 02:06:33.274
<v Speaker 4>almost every time.</v>

2758
02:06:33.850 --> 02:06:35.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way you get to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2759
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:37.300
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

2760
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean just through podcasts.</v>

2761
02:06:39.551 --> 02:06:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning if you don't have a podcast,</v>

2762
02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:45.180
<v Speaker 3>sit down with someone to talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>for several hours and how,</v>

2763
02:06:45.190 --> 02:06:47.170
<v Speaker 3>how often do you do that with your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2764
02:06:47.171 --> 02:06:48.340
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking rare,</v>

2765
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.193
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have made a vested interest in </v>

2766
02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:52.593
<v Speaker 3>long form conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just on the podcast but In my life </v>

2767
02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.240
<v Speaker 3>really over the last like five or six </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2768
02:06:58.280 --> 02:06:59.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who better than you did say that and be </v>

2769
02:07:00.021 --> 02:07:02.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has informed the way that I think,</v>

2770
02:07:02.061 --> 02:07:05.000
<v Speaker 4>the way that it's impacted our society </v>
<v Speaker 4>in our culture,</v>

2771
02:07:05.001 --> 02:07:06.350
<v Speaker 4>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it changed the</v>

2772
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.810
<v Speaker 3>way I feel about being change the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel about what communication is like.</v>

2773
02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have convenient perceptions of people.</v>

2774
02:07:13.901 --> 02:07:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I think we all do our conveniently go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2775
02:07:16.031 --> 02:07:17.950
<v Speaker 3>that guy's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that guy's not,</v>

2776
02:07:17.951 --> 02:07:20.020
<v Speaker 3>or this girl's an asshole or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2777
02:07:20.021 --> 02:07:20.854
<v Speaker 3>My convenient perceptions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that a lot of them are based on </v>

2778
02:07:25.151 --> 02:07:27.850
<v Speaker 3>these brief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brief interactions.</v>

2779
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:30.380
<v Speaker 3>They're based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2780
02:07:30.670 --> 02:07:31.503
<v Speaker 3>small amounts of information that's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed over long periods of and </v>

2781
02:07:35.711 --> 02:07:36.544
<v Speaker 3>maybe one at one time I caught someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were hammered and they were </v>

2782
02:07:38.741 --> 02:07:41.710
<v Speaker 3>being an asshole or maybe I was hammered</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

2783
02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I was annoyed by them or who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2784
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:48.730
<v Speaker 3>but to really understand who a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2785
02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:52.780
<v Speaker 3>you have to sit down with them I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just talk to them and you have to do</v>

2786
02:07:52.781 --> 02:07:53.614
<v Speaker 3>it for a long time and it takes a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and you also observe their actions </v>

2787
02:07:57.161 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and observe them when they're tested and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're observed though,</v>

2788
02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 3>under duress</v>

2789
02:08:01.190 --> 02:08:02.023
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>LIke get out of a long form </v>

2790
02:08:03.651 --> 02:08:04.790
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say like,</v>

2791
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:05.840
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta go now.</v>

2792
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2793
02:08:07.250 --> 02:08:09.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of my depth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the things I said about myself.</v>

2794
02:08:09.441 --> 02:08:13.640
<v Speaker 4>How great I was before this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're opening up this chasm where I</v>

2795
02:08:13.641 --> 02:08:14.474
<v Speaker 4>don't know the thing that I said I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could for a 32nd one minute tv </v>

2796
02:08:17.961 --> 02:08:19.070
<v Speaker 4>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could train,</v>

2797
02:08:19.071 --> 02:08:19.904
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could read the lines and I could come </v>

2798
02:08:22.431 --> 02:08:24.350
<v Speaker 4>off like I look like I know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

2799
02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.900
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to escape this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This freakIng thing.</v>

2800
02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:27.843
<v Speaker 3>I just thought about something like how </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up would a show be if you had </v>

2801
02:08:32.531 --> 02:08:37.240
<v Speaker 3>just a husband and wife alone in a room </v>
<v Speaker 3>with no one reacting to them,</v>

2802
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:38.403
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just them sitting down at a podcast and </v>

2803
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:42.703
<v Speaker 3>that podcast gets broadcast to the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the whole world gets to wash their </v>

2804
02:08:46.271 --> 02:08:49.180
<v Speaker 3>fucked up dysfunctional relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it plays out.</v>

2805
02:08:49.181 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 3>All the weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2806
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:51.214
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's weirdness that you see around </v>

2807
02:08:52.751 --> 02:08:53.584
<v Speaker 3>people and their wives are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you have a couple of </v>

2808
02:08:54.791 --> 02:08:55.624
<v Speaker 3>cocktaIls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wife will say something really </v>

2809
02:08:56.591 --> 02:08:57.424
<v Speaker 3>shitty and</v>

2810
02:08:57.970 --> 02:08:58.803
<v Speaker 4>it's like a cup that spills over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just like keeping all of it </v>

2811
02:09:01.001 --> 02:09:03.190
<v Speaker 4>in the cup and then every once in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you can't keep it in,</v>

2812
02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:04.270
<v Speaker 4>keep it in.</v>

2813
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:06.680
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guy does something,</v>

2814
02:09:06.681 --> 02:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>do she or the girl does something conti </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2815
02:09:09.981 --> 02:09:11.600
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2816
02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:12.493
<v Speaker 4>It first starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts to trickle out and this </v>

2817
02:09:13.941 --> 02:09:17.180
<v Speaker 4>passive aggressive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then eventually if you're there long</v>

2818
02:09:17.181 --> 02:09:21.320
<v Speaker 4>enough it just becomes aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no power on them long enough.</v>

2819
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:23.880
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

2820
02:09:24.330 --> 02:09:26.100
<v Speaker 3>It's so beautiful how that aggression</v>

2821
02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:28.400
<v Speaker 4>comes out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2822
02:09:28.401 --> 02:09:29.960
<v Speaker 4>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me if you liked this,</v>

2823
02:09:29.961 --> 02:09:33.140
<v Speaker 4>you tell them if you liked this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this idea the other day.</v>

2824
02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:34.273
<v Speaker 4>It basically what we're doing it now is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would do a show about ethics </v>

2825
02:09:36.561 --> 02:09:38.540
<v Speaker 4>around like hunting and the outdoors and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2826
02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:39.913
<v Speaker 4>but it would just be called drunk ethics</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I would just be drinking with </v>

2827
02:09:42.321 --> 02:09:45.320
<v Speaker 4>people and having intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations that will increasingly get</v>

2828
02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:46.753
<v Speaker 4>more and more fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible fucking weird and open because </v>

2829
02:09:48.681 --> 02:09:49.514
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting drunk drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking right now through this </v>

2830
02:09:55.461 --> 02:09:58.220
<v Speaker 4>whole thing other thAn other than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that I had to pee.</v>

2831
02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been great.</v>

2832
02:09:59.670 --> 02:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a.</v>

2833
02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:01.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something to be gained </v>

2834
02:10:04.261 --> 02:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>from the release of inhibitions and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something that's.</v>

2835
02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:09.573
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why it has such a </v>

2836
02:10:10.111 --> 02:10:11.760
<v Speaker 3>strong place socially</v>

2837
02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:13.110
<v Speaker 4>we'll plug for right brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2838
02:10:13.111 --> 02:10:13.944
<v Speaker 4>I'm releasing inhibitions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also increasing brain function at </v>

2839
02:10:17.371 --> 02:10:18.204
<v Speaker 4>the same time.</v>

2840
02:10:18.250 --> 02:10:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Your brain is so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag.</v>

2841
02:10:20.051 --> 02:10:20.884
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2842
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:24.120
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is their hashtag?</v>

2843
02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:24.993
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2844
02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I think there'll be a wicked podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>every week.</v>

2845
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:31.870
<v Speaker 3>You get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple that's been fighting tend to go</v>

2846

2848
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:38.630
<v Speaker 2>thought that there was no therapist will</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin everything.</v>

2849
02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:40.850
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People fight should just break up.</v>

2850
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just duke it out until they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>about like fulfillment in life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know you're engaged in this intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with another human being.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We've created a person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're engaged In an activity that 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people fail and they fail</v>

2875
02:11:53.781 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucking goes down.</v>

2876
02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:56.713
<v Speaker 2>He goes down hard and screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>swearing and lawyers of all the levels </v>

2877
02:11:59.931 --> 02:12:02.210
<v Speaker 2>of failure in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's nothing more.</v>

2878
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.190
<v Speaker 2>No faIlure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more impactful than a divorce.</v>

2879
02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have so many friends that have been</v>

2880
02:12:07.671 --> 02:12:11.060
<v Speaker 2>fired from jobs and it's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good,</v>

2881
02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but they bounced back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bounce back.</v>

2882
02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I've seen guys lose who they are from </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce.</v>

2883
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this too many times,</v>

2884
02:12:21.681 --> 02:12:25.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who has been divorced to</v>

2885
02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:30.260
<v Speaker 2>a woman for 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been married to a new one for 12.</v>

02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:33.890
<v Speaker 2>He has family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has children with this new woman.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He still pays every year and they had no</v>

2888
02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>children because he fucked her so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got work.</v>

2889
02:12:46.290 --> 02:12:50.510
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's crazy because the laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>are insane.</v>

2890
02:12:50.690 --> 02:12:53.840
<v Speaker 2>The laws are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't make any sense.</v>

2891
02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about a woman who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 80 years old and can't work anymore</v>

2892
02:12:57.921 --> 02:12:58.280
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2893
02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.580
<v Speaker 2>When we're talking about completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2894
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 2>viable human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

2895
02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:07.340
<v Speaker 2>bananas did his banana foR that to flip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

2896
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:08.174
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when back to the I do thing like when </v>

2897
02:13:09.801 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 2>you say I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's never.</v>

2898
02:13:11.571 --> 02:13:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I did have a buddy who when he said I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they turned around,</v>

2899
02:13:14.001 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 2>She looked mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks scared.</v>

2900
02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Why was she mad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably that she didn't say it right?</v>

2901
02:13:19.941 --> 02:13:24.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did say that some people just don't.</v>

2902
02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:30.043
<v Speaker 2>They're not supposed to be together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they think they should be somebody </v>

2903
02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:32.673
<v Speaker 2>until they find somebody in the talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone into doing something </v>

2904
02:13:34.801 --> 02:13:35.634
<v Speaker 2>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like signing a legal contract that says </v>

2905
02:13:38.341 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be together forever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever until death.</v>

2906
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:41.813
<v Speaker 2>But see like what my problem is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky problem that I've got something </v>

2907
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>that at least in the early years it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be the right thing.</v>

2908
02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you honey.</v>

2909
02:13:50.011 --> 02:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I love you honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope you ain't listen.</v>

2910
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:55.620
<v Speaker 2>She made it this far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we two hours and what?</v>

2911
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Thirty minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2912
02:13:57.391 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2913
02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:58.913
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got a two year old by herself at </v>

2914
02:14:00.181 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 2>home shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She checked a long time ago,</v>

2915
02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.810
<v Speaker 2>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2916
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:05.610
<v Speaker 2>my challenge right now is I think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2917
02:14:05.611 --> 02:14:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this wonderful,</v>

2918
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>beautiful thing and I'm just distresses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm going to fuck it up.</v>

2919
02:14:10.890 --> 02:14:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

2920
02:14:11.911 --> 02:14:12.744
<v Speaker 2>I'm always the stress and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why a lot of </v>

2921
02:14:15.061 --> 02:14:18.870
<v Speaker 2>marriages fail is because of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense pressure of the relationship.</v>

2922
02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:20.093
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a finality in and I </v>

2923
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:23.430
<v Speaker 2>understand the need for this banality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2924
02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:26.910
<v Speaker 2>There's a need for this contract and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything locked down.</v>

2925
02:14:26.911 --> 02:14:29.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't win.</v>

2926
02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:32.790
<v Speaker 2>You raising children like you need help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2927
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:35.790
<v Speaker 2>You need a man to be there to help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise it hopefully,</v>

2928
02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.250
<v Speaker 2>but you also need financial help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

2929
02:14:38.251 --> 02:14:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2930
02:14:38.590 --> 02:14:39.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all.</v>

2931
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:44.930
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense that a woman would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lock things in there like that.</v>

2932
02:14:45.121 --> 02:14:48.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a weird cultural tradition,</v>

2933
02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:48.923
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird thing that we have this </v>

2934
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:52.430
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

2935
02:14:52.431 --> 02:14:53.264
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bring the law involved into </v>

2936
02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:57.990
<v Speaker 2>relationships and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange,</v>

2937
02:14:57.991 --> 02:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>like legal contracts and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are fucking preposterous,</v>

2938
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:03.383
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you see a guy who looks </v>

2939
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like rupert murdoch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2940
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:07.253
<v Speaker 2>And he's got this banging wife and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 years old and she's got big </v>

2941
02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:11.604
<v Speaker 2>tits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or how about harvey weinstein and his </v>

2942
02:15:12.931 --> 02:15:13.764
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in it for the right reason and </v>

2943
02:15:14.491 --> 02:15:15.390
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey son,</v>

2944
02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I see what happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he sees it too.</v>

2945
02:15:18.241 --> 02:15:20.380
<v Speaker 2>We can't be blind to.</v>

2946
02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It was his whole business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they say I do,</v>

2947
02:15:22.141 --> 02:15:22.711
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2948
02:15:22.711 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is disgusting troglodyte type,</v>

2949
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:28.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just gelatinous looking job of the hut </v>

2950
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:32.484
<v Speaker 2>looking man and a beautiful hot young </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife because the guy's got fucking </v>

2951
02:15:36.210 --> 02:15:38.430
<v Speaker 2>kajillions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a normal thing.</v>

2952
02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Then they're both editors put up any </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures,</v>

2953
02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:46.650
<v Speaker 2>but they're both going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those folks there,</v>

2954
02:15:46.730 --> 02:15:48.540
<v Speaker 2>we were both going into that knowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2955
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:50.890
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a traditional or parents.</v>

2956
02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:53.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was really sweet with her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all she needs.</v>

2957
02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 2>She's just this rare soul that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had $5 in his pocket,</v>

2958
02:15:58.231 --> 02:16:02.260
<v Speaker 2>she'd be super happy with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be fucking doubt it.</v>

2959
02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I would doubt it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like a motherfucker.</v>

2960
02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking doubt it.</v>

2961
02:16:07.670 --> 02:16:08.503
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a preposterous union in the first </v>

2962
02:16:10.201 --> 02:16:11.910
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's listen,</v>

2963
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 2>there's some relationships that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could define as legal prostitution.</v>

2964
02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:17.813
<v Speaker 2>They are absolutely legal prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman has made a determination that </v>

2965
02:16:21.031 --> 02:16:26.031
<v Speaker 2>she will let this sloths fluid into her </v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina on an intermittent basis.</v>

2966
02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:28.163
<v Speaker 2>If she could be bathed in diamonds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive a ferrari and live in a mansion </v>

2967
02:16:31.481 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 2>and this is a normal part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people would say,</v>

2968
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:35.254
<v Speaker 2>and I might even say like as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're consenting and they're both </v>

2969
02:16:36.701 --> 02:16:37.534
<v Speaker 2>aware that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that would be a good argument for </v>

2970
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:41.130
<v Speaker 2>prostitution as well though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>

2971
02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:42.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit of a transaction I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2972
02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:43.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2973
02:16:43.841 --> 02:16:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when you look at it,</v>

2974
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.290
<v Speaker 2>it is right that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said,</v>

2975
02:16:47.291 --> 02:16:48.970
<v Speaker 2>why is it okay to give some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>sosh?</v>

2976
02:16:49.450 --> 02:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>He gives him a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

2977
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:55.630
<v Speaker 2>You can't even jerk him off like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not legal.</v>

2978
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.983
<v Speaker 2>That's the government decides who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch your penis and the massage </v>

2979
02:17:02.111 --> 02:17:03.040
<v Speaker 2>therapist said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2980
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:04.583
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy giving you a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go somewhere afterwards of my own </v>

2981
02:17:07.181 --> 02:17:09.130
<v Speaker 2>free will and will jerk you off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>

2982
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:10.410
<v Speaker 2>that'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

2983
02:17:10.411 --> 02:17:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

2984
02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:11.801
<v Speaker 2>you just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2985
02:17:11.801 --> 02:17:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but then the confines of the massage </v>
<v Speaker 2>parlor,</v>

2986
02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:14.733
<v Speaker 2>it's a public health issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if load smelled like gunshots </v>

2987
02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:19.473
<v Speaker 2>and you.</v>

2988
02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:21.673
<v Speaker 2>He go to a massage parlor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a shooting range like fuck is </v>

2989
02:17:24.501 --> 02:17:27.320
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This place is a dirty massage place.</v>

2990
02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm out pew pew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pew</v>

2991
02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:41.640
<v Speaker 2>load smelling jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The devil was coming up for a devil.</v>

2992
02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Purify that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2993
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of laws that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>

2994
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:48.153
<v Speaker 2>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be someone who hears the </v>

2995
02:17:50.171 --> 02:17:54.190
<v Speaker 2>marriage advice I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

2996
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I maybe it was what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier.</v>

2997
02:17:55.841 --> 02:17:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's long form conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having conversations with each other.</v>

2998
02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I have no longer respect like respecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can't get through some</v>

2999
02:18:01.901 --> 02:18:03.440
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff in a very short time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3000
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:04.683
<v Speaker 2>I've always said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate a nice road trip for that </v>

3001
02:18:06.401 --> 02:18:08.300
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3002
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Hanging out with each other for long </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time.</v>

3003
02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:11.473
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd much rather the stress of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport with the kid and the midwife is </v>

3004
02:18:13.871 --> 02:18:15.580
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather just drive it.</v>

3005
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Take the time because you get this like </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection if you can get the phones out</v>

3006
02:18:19.871 --> 02:18:20.704
<v Speaker 2>of the way for the passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just get this connection that you </v>

3007
02:18:22.511 --> 02:18:23.344
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't get otherwise.</v>

3008
02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing things together that are unique </v>

3009
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:27.130
<v Speaker 2>that that helps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3010
02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.233
<v Speaker 2>experiencing things together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also you also have to both have the </v>

3011
02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:31.234
<v Speaker 2>mindset that you enjoy each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and you want to make it work </v>

3012
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:34.570
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3013
02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Some people just don't man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

3014
02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:38.980
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3015
02:18:38.981 --> 02:18:41.890
<v Speaker 2>We've all seen relationships with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls just like check please.</v>

3016
02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.380
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bebe,</v>

3017
02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm different but it's a 50 like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3018
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:46.354
<v Speaker 2>it's a 50 50 thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you have been married for quite </v>

3019
02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:49.804
<v Speaker 2>some time and we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to when we were shooting our bows </v>

3020
02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:53.014
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're like things you've done to </v>

3021
02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.260
<v Speaker 2>make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

3022
02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:57.094
<v Speaker 2>like your wife and she likes you and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works and it's been working for a long </v>

3023
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:04.060
<v Speaker 2>time and like the percentages say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3024
02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:07.610
<v Speaker 2>that's what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 slash 50 is it?</v>

3025
02:19:07.690 --> 02:19:08.523
<v Speaker 2>Chris rock had a great joke about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he was 50 percent of the people </v>

3026
02:19:11.021 --> 02:19:11.854
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3027
02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:15.370
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many cowards just stay?</v>

3028
02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships don't always work,</v>

3029
02:19:22.631 --> 02:19:23.464
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't always know who the fuck you </v>

3030
02:19:25.841 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

3031
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.410
<v Speaker 3>a different person than I was five years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

3032
02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I just am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm a better person.</v>

3033
02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying very hard to be a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

3034
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I certainly know more about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand myself better.</v>

3035
02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow process.</v>

3036
02:19:42.591 --> 02:19:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I think we are all a work in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3037
02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:46.423
<v Speaker 3>And not everybody engages in this work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could be a person who's on this </v>

3038
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:55.200
<v Speaker 3>path of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3039
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:56.383
<v Speaker 3>being present and trying to be kinder </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to improve and then you have </v>

3040
02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:03.920
<v Speaker 3>a spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male or female had just shits on you.</v>

3041
02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:05.053
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the two really brutal toxic </v>

3042
02:20:09.321 --> 02:20:10.154
<v Speaker 3>relationships where they insult and say </v>
<v Speaker 3>rude things around your friends to try </v>

3043
02:20:13.971 --> 02:20:14.900
<v Speaker 3>to fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3044
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:18.450
<v Speaker 3>and people get into these relationships </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they would.</v>

3045
02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:19.960
<v Speaker 3>They genuinely hate.</v>

3046
02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're stuck together.</v>

3047
02:20:21.970 --> 02:20:23.200
<v Speaker 4>And what that does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the children too,</v>

3048
02:20:23.201 --> 02:20:26.880
<v Speaker 4>because I told my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote my dad this letter recently.</v>

3049
02:20:26.881 --> 02:20:27.714
<v Speaker 4>It's getting real deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our number three of the podcast we get </v>

3050
02:20:30.401 --> 02:20:32.920
<v Speaker 4>real deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're pro nuance.</v>

3051
02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:36.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm send it to my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he won't listen to this book.</v>

3052
02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.770
<v Speaker 4>I wrote this letter that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen man.</v>

3053
02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Because I thought I had seen recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>like his developing relationship with my</v>

3054
02:20:43.661 --> 02:20:48.661
<v Speaker 4>son and like shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put this thought in my head that know my</v>

3055
02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:51.160
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dad,</v>

3056
02:20:51.161 --> 02:20:52.120
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his caring for me.</v>

3057
02:20:52.121 --> 02:20:55.210
<v Speaker 4>The fact that he stayed with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they developed this place for me to</v>

3058
02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:00.240
<v Speaker 4>grow and nurture me and allow me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>become a person and the environment.</v>

3059
02:21:00.941 --> 02:21:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a north star for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I left that environment.</v>

3060
02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:04.593
<v Speaker 4>Like I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never wondered what my path was going </v>

3061
02:21:07.511 --> 02:21:08.110
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

3062
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I always could look up and be like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bond that I developed,</v>

3063
02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.880
<v Speaker 4>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their love for me is like the thing that</v>

3064
02:21:12.881 --> 02:21:14.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3065
02:21:14.351 --> 02:21:16.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking back too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also looking forward to.</v>

3066
02:21:16.241 --> 02:21:20.470
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what defines me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what I do,</v>

3067
02:21:20.770 --> 02:21:23.080
<v Speaker 4>I can always fall back on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That my dad loves me,</v>

3068
02:21:23.081 --> 02:21:23.914
<v Speaker 4>my mom loves me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them and I grew up like with the </v>

3069
02:21:27.371 --> 02:21:30.040
<v Speaker 4>strength of soul because I knew I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

3070
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:32.430
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that came from the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>place that I did.</v>

3071
02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:35.770
<v Speaker 4>Same town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't Maryland that odd on heroin.</v>

3072
02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:40.480
<v Speaker 4>They live in the same little suburb </v>
<v Speaker 4>suburbia community that I did.</v>

3073
02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:43.300
<v Speaker 4>They had parents that were the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went to the same high school.</v>

3074
02:21:43.301 --> 02:21:46.570
<v Speaker 4>They lived in the same environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went down one way.</v>

3075
02:21:46.571 --> 02:21:51.571
<v Speaker 4>I went down another and I truly do feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that me going down that way was the</v>

3076
02:21:52.271 --> 02:21:53.104
<v Speaker 4>way that my parents like built this </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure around me that was always </v>

3077
02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:56.773
<v Speaker 4>route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bond and that love and the things </v>

3078
02:21:57.881 --> 02:21:58.714
<v Speaker 4>that that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very fortunate and that's in that me </v>

3079
02:22:02.291 --> 02:22:07.291
<v Speaker 4>being able to later on in life see how </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortunate I was to have that drove me to</v>

3080
02:22:08.411 --> 02:22:09.244
<v Speaker 4>not fail and to not let like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>other failures creep into my life </v>

3081
02:22:14.171 --> 02:22:14.891
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3082
02:22:14.891 --> 02:22:15.850
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll take drugs.</v>

3083
02:22:15.850 --> 02:22:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of friend's place.</v>

3084
02:22:17.471 --> 02:22:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people succumb to drugs</v>

3085
02:22:21.551 --> 02:22:24.130
<v Speaker 4>and alcohol and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of friends die,</v>

3086
02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>baltimore's rough spot.</v>

3087
02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3088
02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:29.490
<v Speaker 4>I come from a town called hagerstown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maryland.</v>

3089
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come from a town,</v>

3090
02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:32.933
<v Speaker 4>but the western Maryland is kind of is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>corridor for interstate 70 and </v>

3091
02:22:35.811 --> 02:22:36.644
<v Speaker 4>interstate 81 and there's a lot of drugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and there's a lot of my friends </v>

3092
02:22:39.691 --> 02:22:42.620
<v Speaker 4>that are either in jail or no longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>around that.</v>

3093
02:22:42.690 --> 02:22:44.090
<v Speaker 4>A lot of successful ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

3094
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:46.560
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened to me and I was able to,</v>

3095
02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I was able to look at that moment and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3096
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I came from the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did the same environment,</v>

3097
02:22:53.370 --> 02:22:55.710
<v Speaker 4>the same friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>

3098
02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:58.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same activities.</v>

3099
02:22:58.891 --> 02:23:00.870
<v Speaker 4>We all hunted and played sports and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

3100
02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we hung out together.</v>

3101
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.220
<v Speaker 4>I went one way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went another way.</v>

3102
02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you attribute that entirely or to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents or is it possible that it's</v>

3103
02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:13.490
<v Speaker 3>like who you chose to hang out with as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well and the activities you engaged in?</v>

3104
02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:14.593
<v Speaker 3>Because unfortunately I know people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were good parents that had kids that </v>

3105
02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:20.540
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

3106
02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:21.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And listen,</v>

3107
02:23:21.321 --> 02:23:22.154
<v Speaker 4>I can't look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to generalize in any way </v>

3108
02:23:24.351 --> 02:23:25.220
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3109
02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:28.100
<v Speaker 4>any one situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My situation was that I could always,</v>

3110
02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:28.993
<v Speaker 4>I felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I told my dad at some point in my </v>

3111
02:23:29.961 --> 02:23:31.740
<v Speaker 4>life where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3112
02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:33.073
<v Speaker 4>I went to him and I was like maybe 20 or</v>
<v Speaker 4>19 and I said I'm going to get all a's </v>

3113
02:23:35.961 --> 02:23:37.490
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm done fucking around.</v>

3114
02:23:37.970 --> 02:23:41.810
<v Speaker 4>Like because I was a c plus student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was the dumbest kid in the smart class</v>

3115
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:44.990
<v Speaker 4>through high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was a,</v>

3116
02:23:44.991 --> 02:23:45.824
<v Speaker 4>there was a time in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized that like I had to pay back </v>

3117
02:23:47.541 --> 02:23:51.050
<v Speaker 4>when my parents and my grandparents and </v>
<v Speaker 4>my family had done for me because I knew</v>

3118
02:23:51.051 --> 02:23:53.120
<v Speaker 4>that they'd given me something that not </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody had.</v>

3119
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:54.950
<v Speaker 4>And I kneW.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3120
02:23:54.951 --> 02:23:55.784
<v Speaker 4>I know that I have to pay this back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to stop messing around now and go </v>

3121
02:23:59.571 --> 02:24:00.470
<v Speaker 4>and do something.</v>

3122
02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:01.593
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because they did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great job then because sometimes what </v>

3123
02:24:06.071 --> 02:24:11.071
<v Speaker 3>happens when people were raised with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant safety net of love.</v>

3124
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become unambitious.</v>

3125
02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:14.890
<v Speaker 3>They become,</v>

3126
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:16.023
<v Speaker 4>I think I was close to them as boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was close to that a little bit like </v>

3127
02:24:17.981 --> 02:24:18.490
<v Speaker 4>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm,</v>

3128
02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:19.323
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to community college and </v>

3129
02:24:19.811 --> 02:24:23.680
<v Speaker 4>smoking a lot of weed and and try and </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a good time.</v>

3130
02:24:23.890 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3131
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:25.283
<v Speaker 4>but there was a time of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a legitimate time in my life </v>

3132
02:24:27.161 --> 02:24:29.800
<v Speaker 4>where I said my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember it,</v>

3133
02:24:29.801 --> 02:24:30.634
<v Speaker 4>but my dad remembers it there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just came to him and like it's over </v>

3134
02:24:32.681 --> 02:24:35.280
<v Speaker 4>now it's time for me to just buckle down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get it.</v>

3135
02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:36.653
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between a child that </v>

3136
02:24:38.191 --> 02:24:42.960
<v Speaker 3>you're taken care of and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who has to be on their own is 10 years.</v>

3137
02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An eight year old.</v>

3138
02:24:44.551 --> 02:24:46.560
<v Speaker 3>No one expects an eight year old take </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of themselves,</v>

3139
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:48.690
<v Speaker 3>but an 18 year old time to get your shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3140
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:51.300
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard concept.</v>

3141
02:24:51.301 --> 02:24:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Quick to argon concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3142
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:53.783
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably hard and unless you </v>

3143
02:24:55.951 --> 02:24:56.784
<v Speaker 3>introduce that child to hard work and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rewards of hard work and you're in </v>

3144
02:24:59.371 --> 02:25:02.340
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to set them up for</v>

3145
02:25:02.341 --> 02:25:03.174
<v Speaker 3>some kind of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was extremely fortunate that I found </v>

3146
02:25:06.031 --> 02:25:11.031
<v Speaker 3>martial arts follow is that my biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle in my teenage years and I found</v>

3147
02:25:11.191 --> 02:25:13.740
<v Speaker 3>something that was insanely difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the highs,</v>

3148
02:25:13.770 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 3>the rewards were like nothing I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced in my life,</v>

3149
02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:20.100
<v Speaker 3>so I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3150
02:25:20.310 --> 02:25:21.143
<v Speaker 3>to get really good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to put in the kind </v>

3151
02:25:23.651 --> 02:25:24.484
<v Speaker 3>of energy that most people are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to do and that's what separates </v>

3152
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:31.620
<v Speaker 3>you from them to find a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a massive amount of energy and focus</v>

3153
02:25:31.621 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 3>and that discipline and then be obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

3154
02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:34.923
<v Speaker 3>Then the rewards come if you analyze it </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly and pursue it with everything </v>

3155
02:25:38.741 --> 02:25:39.574
<v Speaker 3>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to figure out how to get </v>

3156
02:25:40.841 --> 02:25:43.180
<v Speaker 3>better as long as you don't get really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up along the way.</v>

3157
02:25:43.290 --> 02:25:47.830
<v Speaker 3>There was a real possibility of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I realized early on,</v>

3158
02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:48.893
<v Speaker 3>fairly lucky was that all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I saw around me that were engaging </v>

3159
02:25:52.421 --> 02:25:57.421
<v Speaker 3>in all this really risky behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really crazy violence and drugs and what</v>

3160
02:25:57.521 --> 02:26:00.100
<v Speaker 3>they were doing was looking for thrills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3161
02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:00.993
<v Speaker 3>that's what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were looking for thrills in an </v>

3162
02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 3>easily accessible way that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>require discipline.</v>

3163
02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It didn't require years and years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>training and focus and commitment.</v>

3164
02:26:12.551 --> 02:26:15.880
<v Speaker 3>It didn't require that what I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>was something.</v>

3165
02:26:15.890 --> 02:26:17.620
<v Speaker 3>And I was just lucky that I found this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3166
02:26:17.621 --> 02:26:20.050
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to get bullied and </v>
<v Speaker 3>picked on.</v>

3167
02:26:20.051 --> 02:26:21.070
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was little.</v>

3168
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't a big kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You exerting look some control over your</v>

3169
02:26:23.591 --> 02:26:24.990
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just really.</v>

3170
02:26:24.991 --> 02:26:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3171
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of being scared of people.</v>

3172
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Discard this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me this fucking tough guy.</v>

3173
02:26:32.921 --> 02:26:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Look and I've got to go the other way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm scared.</v>

3174
02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to be that.</v>

3175
02:26:38.970 --> 02:26:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm so that carried on with me for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life,</v>

3176
02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:44.373
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen so many people that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>find a discipline and they just bounce </v>

3177
02:26:47.981 --> 02:26:51.300
<v Speaker 3>around like a cork at sea forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

3178
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:53.080
<v Speaker 3>iT's one of the reasons why I push it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

3179
02:26:53.081 --> 02:26:53.914
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is that you can do </v>

3180
02:26:55.810 --> 02:27:00.220
<v Speaker 3>that you like to do that's competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things about competition</v>

3181
02:27:00.221 --> 02:27:02.410
<v Speaker 3>is not just that you prove that I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking man.</v>

3182
02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is hard.</v>

3183
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.863
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking cup competition is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest things because if someone's </v>

3184
02:27:07.421 --> 02:27:08.580
<v Speaker 3>trying to do it and you're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3185
02:27:08.581 --> 02:27:11.640
<v Speaker 3>it's like how much do you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much more do you want them?</v>

3186
02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:13.570
<v Speaker 3>They want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3187
02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:17.690
<v Speaker 3>that becomes this crazy fucking battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>internally as well as.</v>

3188
02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:18.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you say like all the time say </v>

3189
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:21.220
<v Speaker 4>pressure creates diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3190
02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:23.460
<v Speaker 4>And in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3191
02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:26.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized that I didn't,</v>

3192
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.950
<v Speaker 4>I realized somewhere in my life that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the opportunity to.</v>

3193
02:27:30.310 --> 02:27:32.020
<v Speaker 4>There's not enough pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3194
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I have this like soft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

3195
02:27:33.941 --> 02:27:35.770
<v Speaker 4>soft thing to fall back on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

3196
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:37.023
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle class family that they'll </v>

3197
02:27:37.871 --> 02:27:42.320
<v Speaker 4>probably let me live there in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>basement for songs that relate.</v>

3198
02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like I had the opportunity to </v>

3199
02:27:45.041 --> 02:27:48.460
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I just realized that part of</v>

3200
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:49.294
<v Speaker 4>the reason I wanted to push forward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it and find something that I was </v>

3201
02:27:51.881 --> 02:27:54.460
<v Speaker 4>passionate about it because I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a choice.</v>

3202
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:58.870
<v Speaker 4>I had a choice That I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could try to do something different or</v>

3203
02:27:58.871 --> 02:27:59.704
<v Speaker 4>I could fall back on what had been given</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I felt that what I'd been given was </v>

3204
02:28:03.521 --> 02:28:05.890
<v Speaker 4>significant enough to my life that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>owed it.</v>

3205
02:28:06.370 --> 02:28:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did something.</v>

3206
02:28:07.330 --> 02:28:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I owed it to drive toward whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness I could find.</v>

3207
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:13.063
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was that the stability of my family </v>

3208
02:28:16.451 --> 02:28:18.400
<v Speaker 4>life and it wasn't perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

3209
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And rather than sink into</v>

3210
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.551
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3211
02:28:22.551 --> 02:28:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just push,</v>

3212
02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:26.420
<v Speaker 3>push through that and use that as fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as intelligence.</v>

3213
02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:28.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have an awareness,</v>

3214
02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:28.711
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3215
02:28:28.711 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you figured out what you can do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3216
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.923
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where this can go wrong and you </v>

3217
02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:36.770
<v Speaker 3>recognized it and you decided to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>some changes,</v>

3218
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.863
<v Speaker 4>not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure I like it'll have ups and </v>

3219
02:28:39.491 --> 02:28:40.324
<v Speaker 4>downs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hunting is a thing that enriched my </v>

3220
02:28:41.951 --> 02:28:42.761
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>truly did.</v>

3221
02:28:42.761 --> 02:28:43.594
<v Speaker 4>And then as much as it is problematic in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that it's presented in society </v>

3222
02:28:46.691 --> 02:28:48.220
<v Speaker 4>in the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3223
02:28:48.221 --> 02:28:49.054
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people see it when they look at it </v>

3224
02:28:51.611 --> 02:28:54.760
<v Speaker 4>through like a shallow lens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3225
02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:56.553
<v Speaker 4>I can say truly that it's enriched my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life in ways I'll never be able to like </v>

3226
02:29:00.730 --> 02:29:02.710
<v Speaker 4>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I met you through it.</v>

3227
02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.400
<v Speaker 4>Like I met a lot of people I met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

3228
02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:09.410
<v Speaker 3>and then I've met a lot of good people </v>
<v Speaker 3>through that.</v>

3229
02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:10.593
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is looking at it from the </v>

3230
02:29:11.741 --> 02:29:14.440
<v Speaker 3>outside versus experiencing the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're meeting.</v>

3231
02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:15.333
<v Speaker 3>These are people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's insanely difficult and </v>

3232
02:29:17.771 --> 02:29:19.720
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like it is for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

3233
02:29:19.930 --> 02:29:21.050
<v Speaker 3>You look on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you,</v>

3234
02:29:21.130 --> 02:29:23.650
<v Speaker 3>what's so difficult to shoot in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent animal?</v>

3235
02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you and I mostly do,</v>

3236
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:30.430
<v Speaker 3>is one of the most difficult things I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever done in my life and I've done a lot</v>

3237
02:29:30.431 --> 02:29:32.470
<v Speaker 3>of difficult shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking difficult.</v>

3238
02:29:32.471 --> 02:29:36.010
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly difficult and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you meet are not just disciplined,</v>

3239
02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 3>but they're in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be like.</v>

3240
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:39.623
<v Speaker 3>There's a physical exertion aspect to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's completely ignored and </v>

3241
02:29:42.221 --> 02:29:44.380
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood or people are ignorant of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3242
02:29:44.410 --> 02:29:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Not that it's ignored and they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand it.</v>

3243
02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:52.600
<v Speaker 3>It's Almost like an athletic pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sustains life.</v>

3244
02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:53.980
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

3245
02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:54.843
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why campaigns is out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there running marathons and ultra </v>

3246
02:29:56.831 --> 02:29:58.390
<v Speaker 3>marathon running right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

3247
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:59.463
<v Speaker 3>He's not just doing thAt because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoys fitness and he most certainly </v>

3248
02:30:01.691 --> 02:30:02.524
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing that because it helps him as </v>

3249
02:30:03.881 --> 02:30:06.580
<v Speaker 3>a hunter and that took a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3250
02:30:06.581 --> 02:30:07.960
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

3251
02:30:07.961 --> 02:30:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen hunting.</v>

3252
02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:10.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3253
02:30:10.631 --> 02:30:12.250
<v Speaker 4>if you listen to this podcast and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>never hunted,</v>

3254
02:30:12.251 --> 02:30:17.251
<v Speaker 4>like I wouldn't encourage you to go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>find these people on the internet,</v>

3255
02:30:17.471 --> 02:30:18.304
<v Speaker 4>on the social medias and things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that each one of them </v>

3256
02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:22.120
<v Speaker 4>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

3257
02:30:22.121 --> 02:30:23.680
<v Speaker 4>a layer of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3258
02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:26.950
<v Speaker 4>John dudley represents to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a wonderful human being,</v>

3259
02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:30.250
<v Speaker 4>but like at its core on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he represents the expert archer.</v>

3260
02:30:30.430 --> 02:30:31.263
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a layer of hunting that you need </v>

3261
02:30:32.441 --> 02:30:33.274
<v Speaker 4>to have if you're gonna be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Campaigns represents the physically fit </v>

3262
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:40.480
<v Speaker 4>hunter and that's a layer that you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have if you're going to be ultimately</v>

3263
02:30:40.481 --> 02:30:44.830
<v Speaker 4>successful like remy warren represent </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the ultimate predator.</v>

3264
02:30:44.831 --> 02:30:45.664
<v Speaker 4>Being able to think about like an animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>does and move like an animal does and </v>

3265
02:30:48.850 --> 02:30:51.520
<v Speaker 4>that's a layer that you have to have if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be ultimately successful</v>

3266
02:30:51.521 --> 02:30:53.920
<v Speaker 4>and steven rinella represents the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great thinker,</v>

3267
02:30:53.921 --> 02:30:54.754
<v Speaker 4>the great theorist and all these are </v>
<v Speaker 4>layers that you have to have at some </v>

3268
02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:01.540
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To be a good hunter,</v>

3269
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:05.110
<v Speaker 3>to be the best hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be successful consistently,</v>

3270
02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:06.333
<v Speaker 3>you have to know so much and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things when I got into it that was </v>

3271
02:31:09.310 --> 02:31:11.530
<v Speaker 3>interesting that steve said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3272
02:31:11.890 --> 02:31:14.980
<v Speaker 3>you're going to really like this because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has so many layers to it.</v>

3273
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:16.603
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of room to learn and grow </v>

3274
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:22.020
<v Speaker 3>and you've never can master it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3275
02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:24.450
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get especially bow hunting.</v>

3276
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:25.733
<v Speaker 3>What are the possibilities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna run into the same scenario </v>

3277
02:31:28.561 --> 02:31:30.320
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

3278
02:31:30.350 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean you get lucky a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a row,</v>

3279
02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:33.593
<v Speaker 3>but eventually you're gonna run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a situation where the wind </v>

3280
02:31:36.871 --> 02:31:41.370
<v Speaker 3>catches you or something goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stepped on a tree branch and snaps</v>

3281
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:42.533
<v Speaker 4>and it's one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it teaches you accountability </v>

3282
02:31:44.591 --> 02:31:47.560
<v Speaker 4>too because when you release an arrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>

3283
02:31:47.561 --> 02:31:48.394
<v Speaker 4>You can say whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've had all these situations where </v>

3284
02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:53.220
<v Speaker 4>I've arrowed landed in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean it to,</v>

3285
02:31:54.370 --> 02:31:55.203
<v Speaker 4>and it teaches is accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It teaches you ultimate accountability </v>

3286
02:31:58.830 --> 02:32:00.580
<v Speaker 4>because when you release that arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not,</v>

3287
02:32:00.581 --> 02:32:03.870
<v Speaker 4>you can't go get it back and if it hits </v>
<v Speaker 4>the animal and a place in wounds and the</v>

3288
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:04.704
<v Speaker 4>animal suffers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is on you and there is no way to get </v>

3289
02:32:08.051 --> 02:32:08.884
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to get out of that </v>

3290
02:32:09.431 --> 02:32:10.570
<v Speaker 4>feeling and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>

3291
02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've had like months,</v>

3292
02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:15.580
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like six months of just like,</v>

3293
02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to overstate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not hyperbolic,</v>

3294
02:32:18.251 --> 02:32:21.140
<v Speaker 4>but like just really a lot of pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>around like I did and I.</v>

3295
02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:23.560
<v Speaker 4>It was my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got lazy,</v>

3296
02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:26.920
<v Speaker 4>I was presumptive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got too confident.</v>

3297
02:32:27.430 --> 02:32:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I just screwed up in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened,</v>

3298
02:32:29.291 --> 02:32:34.291
<v Speaker 4>but I've sent a very sharp object into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rump of a big elk and it ran off and</v>

3299
02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:36.400
<v Speaker 4>never to be seen again.</v>

3300
02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of thAt one motion,</v>

3301
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:39.983
<v Speaker 3>the one movement that's going to release</v>
<v Speaker 3>that arrow are so significant that it </v>

3302
02:32:43.441 --> 02:32:46.320
<v Speaker 3>fucks with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where what we were talking about,</v>

3303
02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about this many times,</v>

3304
02:32:47.551 --> 02:32:49.200
<v Speaker 3>but target panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

3305
02:32:49.530 --> 02:32:50.363
<v Speaker 3>That's the realization of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipation of the moment and the </v>

3306
02:32:53.161 --> 02:32:53.994
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the understanding of the potential </v>

3307
02:32:55.711 --> 02:32:56.544
<v Speaker 3>negative consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're overwhelming and they haunt </v>

3308
02:32:58.441 --> 02:33:00.750
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't fuck this up in the.</v>

3309
02:33:00.751 --> 02:33:02.700
<v Speaker 3>You never should think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck this up.</v>

3310
02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to me there's massive parallels with</v>

3311
02:33:05.490 --> 02:33:06.630
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>

3312
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:09.120
<v Speaker 3>but also with pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with playing pool,</v>

3313
02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:11.400
<v Speaker 3>like if you're about to shoot a basket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say to bring it up,</v>

3314
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:12.431
<v Speaker 3>don't mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mess,</v>

3315
02:33:12.431 --> 02:33:13.890
<v Speaker 3>don't mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to fuck in</v>

3316
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:19.750
<v Speaker 4>to go where you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also there's no part of pool.</v>

3317
02:33:20.370 --> 02:33:22.300
<v Speaker 4>if the ball goes where you didn't intend</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to,</v>

3318
02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:23.613
<v Speaker 4>an anImal gets made right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The consequences are so much so you can </v>

3319
02:33:26.621 --> 02:33:27.454
<v Speaker 4>equate the consequences in your mind to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be successful because at some level you </v>

3320
02:33:29.681 --> 02:33:31.960
<v Speaker 4>have to write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be an important motion for you</v>

3321
02:33:31.961 --> 02:33:33.370
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to really care to do it right.</v>

3322
02:33:34.090 --> 02:33:36.700
<v Speaker 4>But there's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I say like,</v>

3323
02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:41.710
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why I continue to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I do is because this is,</v>

3324
02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:42.723
<v Speaker 4>this thing is complex and I see other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's confusion around it and I </v>

3325
02:33:46.361 --> 02:33:47.194
<v Speaker 4>appreciate their confusion and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that it's hard to get and I </v>

3326
02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:55.000
<v Speaker 4>desperately want to find ways to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it easier.</v>

3327
02:33:55.100 --> 02:34:00.100
<v Speaker 3>An analogy would be for pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if every time you played pool,</v>

3328
02:34:00.350 --> 02:34:01.183
<v Speaker 3>you waited days and days for one shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't know what the shot would </v>

3329
02:34:06.621 --> 02:34:07.454
<v Speaker 3>be and sometimes you had to shoot it </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly and if you missed and didn't </v>

3330
02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:11.474
<v Speaker 3>make the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal would scream out in agony and </v>

3331
02:34:14.901 --> 02:34:17.950
<v Speaker 3>die a slow death and you would be for </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

3332
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:18.993
<v Speaker 3>That's when you think about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult it is to perform under that </v>

3333
02:34:22.751 --> 02:34:23.870
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3334
02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:24.691
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3335
02:34:24.691 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this intense pressure of the one moment.</v>

3336
02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:31.280
<v Speaker 3>IT's like nothing else</v>

3337
02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:33.040
<v Speaker 4>that stressed me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just thinking about it because it is,</v>

3338
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:34.720
<v Speaker 4>it's real life though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

3339
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:36.103
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think steve rinella probably said it </v>

3340
02:34:37.810 --> 02:34:39.960
<v Speaker 4>at some point or you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or somebody really smart did this.</v>

3341
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

3342
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:45.100
<v Speaker 4>It includes like riding a rollercoaster </v>
<v Speaker 4>is thrilling,</v>

3343
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.730
<v Speaker 4>but the third dimension isn't there </v>
<v Speaker 4>because when you get off,</v>

3344
02:34:48.731 --> 02:34:51.190
<v Speaker 4>nothing happened really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got the thrill,</v>

3345
02:34:51.191 --> 02:34:52.024
<v Speaker 4>but there was no consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrill and really that's kind of the </v>

3346
02:34:54.281 --> 02:34:55.890
<v Speaker 4>point of buying a ticket to ride on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rollercoaster,</v>

3347
02:34:55.970 --> 02:34:56.803
<v Speaker 4>getting a thrill without having to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>part in anything substantial with </v>

3348
02:35:00.401 --> 02:35:02.710
<v Speaker 4>hunting there is thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's fun.</v>

3349
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:04.113
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's seen videos of dudes hooping</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hollering and hugging you and I've </v>

3350
02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:08.193
<v Speaker 4>done it around the killing of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that because I always asked </v>

3351
02:35:10.931 --> 02:35:12.670
<v Speaker 4>myself like some really key questions </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3352
02:35:12.671 --> 02:35:15.580
<v Speaker 4>why is killing gratifying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's.</v>

3353
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:17.830
<v Speaker 4>What's the answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3354
02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:20.440
<v Speaker 4>What's the answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3355
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:21.790
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be hard to explain.</v>

3356
02:35:21.810 --> 02:35:22.643
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he hard to explain one to someone </v>

3357
02:35:25.501 --> 02:35:26.334
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing that's going on is you just </v>

3358
02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:29.753
<v Speaker 3>accomplished something that's insanely </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to do and you're relieved that </v>

3359
02:35:32.731 --> 02:35:37.440
<v Speaker 3>their animal died and that relief </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself in a exuberance.</v>

3360
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:40.020
<v Speaker 3>You high five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hug,</v>

3361
02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:41.491
<v Speaker 3>he let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>

3362
02:35:41.491 --> 02:35:42.324
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're happy that it happened and it </v>

3363
02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:47.520
<v Speaker 3>died quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>

3364
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:49.110
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a part of it.</v>

3365
02:35:49.350 --> 02:35:49.731
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm.</v>

3366
02:35:49.731 --> 02:35:51.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've made just like post on social media</v>

3367
02:35:51.571 --> 02:35:54.060
<v Speaker 4>yesterday around like grip and grins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grip and grants,</v>

3368
02:35:54.061 --> 02:35:54.894
<v Speaker 4>man a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're anti agrippa grid for a long </v>

3369
02:35:55.921 --> 02:35:58.500
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gave a big sticking point.</v>

3370
02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:01.230
<v Speaker 4>It did explain to grip and grin for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>uneducated.</v>

3371
02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:02.910
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about us talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3372
02:36:02.911 --> 02:36:05.280
<v Speaker 4>about we're going to try to write an </v>
<v Speaker 4>article for the mediator.com</v>

3373
02:36:05.281 --> 02:36:07.910
<v Speaker 4>about a pub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A grip and grin is there's.</v>

3374
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:09.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this goes back many,</v>

3375
02:36:09.751 --> 02:36:12.120
<v Speaker 4>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it goes back to teddy roosevelt.</v>

3376
02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:13.013
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to the turn of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Market heart is like the photos we </v>

3377
02:36:15.391 --> 02:36:16.224
<v Speaker 4>showed earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking a photo with the thing you just </v>

3378
02:36:18.421 --> 02:36:20.280
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His is no new thing to us.</v>

3379
02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.960
<v Speaker 4>It's as old as photos is the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 4>photos.</v>

3380
02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Grip and grin just means you're with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

3381
02:36:24.301 --> 02:36:25.134
<v Speaker 4>you're gripping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its antlers are gripping apart of the </v>

3382
02:36:26.191 --> 02:36:30.240
<v Speaker 4>animal and you're smiling and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy that you did that.</v>

3383
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I think what I would say about grip</v>

3384
02:36:33.931 --> 02:36:36.330
<v Speaker 4>and grins is that it's been weaponized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3385
02:36:36.331 --> 02:36:37.164
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody that's listening to this may </v>

3386
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:41.720
<v Speaker 4>is likely seen the girl with the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the giraffe,</v>

3387
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.430
<v Speaker 4>the guy with the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the girl,</v>

3388
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:46.490
<v Speaker 4>the other girl did the giraffe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy with the baboons.</v>

3389
02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:49.490
<v Speaker 4>It's been weaponized and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3390
02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:52.920
<v Speaker 4>it's been weaponized to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the thing,</v>

3391
02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:56.400
<v Speaker 4>the first thing that somebody like say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ricky gervais' might.</v>

3392
02:36:56.610 --> 02:36:59.010
<v Speaker 4>he finds this thing online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He eats meat by the way.</v>

3393
02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.770
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

3394
02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:03.460
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

3395
02:37:03.470 --> 02:37:04.303
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever had him on here?</v>

3396
02:37:04.430 --> 02:37:05.263
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I talked to him and opie and </v>

3397
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:06.620
<v Speaker 3>anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nice guy.</v>

3398
02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I remember listening to the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting if they eat the meat.</v>

3399
02:37:10.290 --> 02:37:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3400
02:37:11.010 --> 02:37:13.280
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we've weaponized the term trophy with</v>

3401
02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:17.080
<v Speaker 4>weaponize this script and can thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>

3402
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:19.303
<v Speaker 4>society and we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that honey is the honey was a </v>

3403
02:37:23.091 --> 02:37:23.924
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of people would buy stock in </v>

3404
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:26.960
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's less people doing it.</v>

3405
02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:27.973
<v Speaker 4>It's less relevant to society and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon that a lot of folks are using </v>

3406
02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:32.174
<v Speaker 4>that don't like it is this photo and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>photo depicts a person smiling next to </v>

3407
02:37:38.211 --> 02:37:39.044
<v Speaker 4>or overtop of a dead animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so at its face it absolutely says </v>

3408
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:46.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy that there's a dead animal in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of me.</v>

3409
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:49.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough information for such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant moment.</v>

3410
02:37:49.490 --> 02:37:51.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I've said around like around the</v>

3411
02:37:51.861 --> 02:37:53.420
<v Speaker 4>photo is it happened for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

3412
02:37:53.421 --> 02:37:54.920
<v Speaker 4>but then social media became a deal.</v>

3413
02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And during the eighties and nineties,</v>

3414
02:37:58.401 --> 02:37:59.234
<v Speaker 4>grip and grins were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember going to like my first trade </v>

3415
02:38:01.521 --> 02:38:06.521
<v Speaker 4>shows as a kid or in people would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>like flip books of grip and grins.</v>

3416
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:09.140
<v Speaker 4>They would like get them out and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3417
02:38:09.141 --> 02:38:11.540
<v Speaker 4>you see what I killed this year before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before cell phones or whatever.</v>

3418
02:38:11.541 --> 02:38:12.830
<v Speaker 4>They would bring them out and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that,</v>

3419
02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.320
<v Speaker 4>look at all the things I killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like this,</v>

3420
02:38:15.321 --> 02:38:16.154
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this communication between hunters that </v>

3421
02:38:17.541 --> 02:38:21.070
<v Speaker 4>was legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know what a gripping rain is.</v>

3422
02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not questioning it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then social media becomes prevalent.</v>

3423
02:38:25.311 --> 02:38:26.144
<v Speaker 4>people start posting these photos to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone where they can control the </v>

3424
02:38:29.571 --> 02:38:33.260
<v Speaker 4>messaging anymore and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the easiest things,</v>

3425
02:38:33.261 --> 02:38:36.440
<v Speaker 4>one of the most oxymoronic thanks to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>pluck from hunting and be like,</v>

3426
02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.600
<v Speaker 4>don't understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this looks fucked up.</v>

3427
02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:42.530
<v Speaker 4>Let me apply that to trophy hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>let me damn this person for this photo.</v>

3428
02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:45.680
<v Speaker 4>And so with that lady with the goat </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

3429
02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:46.514
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3430
02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Invasive species on an island where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to kill it.</v>

3431
02:38:50.321 --> 02:38:53.470
<v Speaker 1>It's killing all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the native wildlife.</v>

3432
02:38:53.471 --> 02:38:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3433
02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:57.350
<v Speaker 4>but then later on they find that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a photo of that young lady with a bloody</v>

3434
02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:01.730
<v Speaker 4>dildo and got blood on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you not hear about that part?</v>

3435
02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:02.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3436
02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have to get that on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>old google machine.</v>

3437
02:39:05.470 --> 02:39:06.303
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough subject for three hours </v>

3438
02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:07.874
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that happened.</v>

3439
02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>

3440
02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Just put up stuff that's hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explaIn this.</v>

3441
02:39:14.210 --> 02:39:15.043
<v Speaker 4>There was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of bachelorette party or </v>

3442
02:39:16.431 --> 02:39:17.530
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that young lady.</v>

3443
02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:19.700
<v Speaker 4>The same lady that was in the skyland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct?</v>

3444
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a bloody dildo goat blood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I believe so.</v>

3447
02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Why was she trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3448
02:39:33.380 --> 02:39:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she just partying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could have been just having a great </v>

3449
02:39:35.991 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if is a photo with me with a bloody</v>

<v Speaker 2>lick.</v>

3499
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Sort of rude and arrogant throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

3500
02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Who's gearing a think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must have been her international host.</v>

3501
02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's british.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jumped on the trip with one of the women</v>

3502
02:41:41.801 --> 02:41:43.300
<v Speaker 2>on the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3503
02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:44.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like two chicks and get </v>

3504
02:41:44.921 --> 02:41:48.700
<v Speaker 2>along to hear her side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit of fun during the party.</v>

3505
02:41:48.850 --> 02:41:49.683
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marital aid is given as a birthday </v>

3506
02:41:52.181 --> 02:41:53.014
<v Speaker 2>prison</v>

3507
02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:55.650
<v Speaker 4>to an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea why I was brought out the</v>

3508
02:41:55.651 --> 02:41:57.860
<v Speaker 4>following day on the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an appalling thing to do.</v>

3509
02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Please show disrespect to the animal she</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

3510
02:41:59.970 --> 02:42:00.803
<v Speaker 2>She has just killed the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't know because it was dead and I </v>

3511
02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:06.930
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3512
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

3513
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:11.623
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm horrified by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not friends with her any longer and </v>

3514
02:42:15.331 --> 02:42:16.164
<v Speaker 2>in fact she's the reason that I left </v>
<v Speaker 2>early because I was so against what she </v>

3515
02:42:18.931 --> 02:42:22.440
<v Speaker 2>stood for and her more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to read this.</v>

3516
02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicks,</v>

3517
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.983
<v Speaker 4>chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ladies,</v>

3518
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:26.833
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that person contact with </v>

3519
02:42:28.411 --> 02:42:30.840
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never met that person.</v>

3520
02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that happens like this.</v>

3521
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:33.623
<v Speaker 4>This is just an example of who knows the</v>
<v Speaker 4>weaponizing of these situations where </v>

3522
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:41.970
<v Speaker 4>somebody dildos get pulled out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets upset every time.</v>

3523
02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not know about that though.</v>

3524
02:42:43.930 --> 02:42:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

3525
02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:47.970
<v Speaker 4>That's one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one example,</v>

3526
02:42:47.971 --> 02:42:48.804
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what ends up happening around </v>

3527
02:42:49.921 --> 02:42:50.790
<v Speaker 4>these images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3528
02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:54.030
<v Speaker 4>when I posted this thing the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half people would say like,</v>

3529
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:55.163
<v Speaker 4>don't stop doing what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you feel it's right and you feel </v>

3530
02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.930
<v Speaker 4>respectful as a hunter and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling the entire story,</v>

3531
02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:03.840
<v Speaker 4>and part of that story is to sit behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ambulance,</v>

3532
02:43:03.841 --> 02:43:06.840
<v Speaker 4>smile and and signify how great you feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

3533
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:08.340
<v Speaker 4>Then go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3534
02:43:08.341 --> 02:43:09.174
<v Speaker 4>That's what you should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't let someone else change your </v>

3535
02:43:10.711 --> 02:43:11.544
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

3536
02:43:11.650 --> 02:43:12.483
<v Speaker 4>The other side of things is like every </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter has a chance to impact somebody </v>

3537
02:43:15.461 --> 02:43:17.290
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every hunter,</v>

3538
02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:18.213
<v Speaker 4>there's 11 million hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a chance to impact the </v>

3539
02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:22.024
<v Speaker 4>millions and millions of folks who </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't exposed to hunting at any point </v>

3540
02:43:25.571 --> 02:43:28.270
<v Speaker 4>in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I can see.</v>

3541
02:43:28.271 --> 02:43:30.680
<v Speaker 4>I can really see both things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me it's.</v>

3542
02:43:30.890 --> 02:43:31.723
<v Speaker 4>It's an issue of if I want honey to </v>
<v Speaker 4>continue in the way that it does and I </v>

3543
02:43:36.191 --> 02:43:40.090
<v Speaker 4>want my social media privileges to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting better,</v>

3544
02:43:40.450 --> 02:43:43.420
<v Speaker 4>I would probably choose not to put that </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there unless it was in the context I</v>

3545
02:43:43.421 --> 02:43:45.550
<v Speaker 4>felt very comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very fair.</v>

3546
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:48.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not just fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's honest and um,</v>

3547
02:43:48.930 --> 02:43:49.763
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously if you had those photos </v>

3548
02:43:52.201 --> 02:43:53.910
<v Speaker 3>and you show them to someone like me </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's hunted,</v>

3549
02:43:53.911 --> 02:43:55.230
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't bother me at all and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3550
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:56.490
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a nice deer.</v>

3551
02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:57.343
<v Speaker 4>It's all about context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all like I could slide it across </v>

3552
02:43:58.881 --> 02:44:00.530
<v Speaker 4>the table to you or texted to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would say,</v>

3553
02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:02.210
<v Speaker 4>cool man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>congratulations.</v>

3554
02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:05.950
<v Speaker 3>You and I have been on several hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what it's like.</v>

3555
02:44:05.951 --> 02:44:06.784
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3556
02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

3557
02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:08.733
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to explain what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is it's like fast food for </v>

3558
02:44:12.011 --> 02:44:13.780
<v Speaker 3>an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>

3559
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:16.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a tiny little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>

3560
02:44:16.571 --> 02:44:17.404
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting the full context of </v>

3561
02:44:18.821 --> 02:44:22.360
<v Speaker 3>where the food came from or how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal was raised and how was killed and</v>

3562
02:44:22.361 --> 02:44:23.194
<v Speaker 3>turned into a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just getting the burger real quick </v>

3563
02:44:24.490 --> 02:44:25.760
<v Speaker 3>and this is what you're getting with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>photo.</v>

3564
02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>You just getting a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3565
02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:27.693
<v Speaker 3>not getting the full context of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that led up to you shooting </v>

3566
02:44:31.001 --> 02:44:33.730
<v Speaker 3>this deer that might be like this 200 </v>
<v Speaker 3>inch mule deer.</v>

3567
02:44:33.731 --> 02:44:35.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a lifetime.</v>

3568
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:36.150
<v Speaker 3>You have this giant smile on.</v>

3569
02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:37.033
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3570
02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:41.790
<v Speaker 3>believe you outwitted this old monarch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the forest and put an arrow in his.</v>

3571
02:44:41.791 --> 02:44:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

3572
02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:43.270
<v Speaker 3>his rib cage</v>

3573
02:44:43.350 --> 02:44:44.320
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I.</v>

3574
02:44:44.321 --> 02:44:48.900
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's a totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate way to express your hunting.</v>

3575
02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:52.200
<v Speaker 4>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were to ask me today,</v>

3576
02:44:52.201 --> 02:44:53.034
<v Speaker 4>I would say I would probably not give </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody the chance to misrepresent my </v>

3577
02:44:55.891 --> 02:44:56.724
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't put pictures like that up </v>

3578
02:44:57.961 --> 02:44:58.794
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

3579
02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:01.080
<v Speaker 4>Same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't in the past,</v>

3580
02:45:01.081 --> 02:45:03.400
<v Speaker 4>but I've put a lot of elk meat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

3581
02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:06.060
<v Speaker 4>For me it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put the meet up,</v>

3582
02:45:06.061 --> 02:45:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I put all the whole story up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I was to say,</v>

3583
02:45:08.401 --> 02:45:09.234
<v Speaker 4>like I always said in the very beginning</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the whole me not liking grip and </v>

3584
02:45:12.271 --> 02:45:13.870
<v Speaker 4>grins conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3585
02:45:13.871 --> 02:45:14.730
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone had said,</v>

3586
02:45:14.731 --> 02:45:15.564
<v Speaker 4>ben,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you give that up for the betterment </v>

3587
02:45:17.071 --> 02:45:17.904
<v Speaker 4>of haunting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like could you just give that one thing </v>

3588
02:45:19.591 --> 02:45:20.424
<v Speaker 4>up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's traditionally it's been done for </v>

3589
02:45:21.210 --> 02:45:24.240
<v Speaker 4>decades or for a guy kills the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sits in front of it.</v>

3590
02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:25.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you be willing to give that up if </v>

3591
02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:29.220
<v Speaker 4>for some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape or form?</v>

3592
02:45:29.221 --> 02:45:30.054
<v Speaker 4>Even if you didn't agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made for a better hunting to hunter </v>

3593
02:45:34.231 --> 02:45:35.670
<v Speaker 4>to non hunter relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3594
02:45:35.671 --> 02:45:36.560
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3595
02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:37.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm down for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3596
02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:38.573
<v Speaker 4>and so I think that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation is now is trying to </v>

3597
02:45:41.490 --> 02:45:45.360
<v Speaker 4>determine is that the best thing or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3598
02:45:45.370 --> 02:45:46.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I have the answers.</v>

3599
02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I think for anybody who's listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this three hour conversation and sort of</v>

3600
02:45:49.851 --> 02:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>gets an understanding of where we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from,</v>

3601
02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:54.500
<v Speaker 3>they'll appreciate that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought involved here.</v>

3602
02:45:54.980 --> 02:45:58.130
<v Speaker 3>For anybody that sees that photograph of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you smiling with a dead bear,</v>

3603
02:45:58.131 --> 02:45:58.964
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to appreciate that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be real quick and they're </v>

3604
02:46:00.741 --> 02:46:01.574
<v Speaker 3>gonna have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people are willing to sit here </v>

3605
02:46:03.770 --> 02:46:04.603
<v Speaker 3>and listen to this whole conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get to get an understanding of how </v>

3606
02:46:08.871 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>your works and</v>

3607
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.873
<v Speaker 2>how you think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not nearly as many as we'll look at a </v>

3608
02:46:13.641 --> 02:46:14.990
<v Speaker 2>photo and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a cunt,</v>

3609
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the ricky gervais' tack,</v>

3610
02:46:17.730 --> 02:46:18.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as I do enjoy re ricky's comedy </v>

3611
02:46:21.141 --> 02:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>and when he looks at these things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3612
02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:26.180
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking giraffe one,</v>

3613
02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.033
<v Speaker 2>that's a rough one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was super complicated and glenn </v>

3614
02:46:29.001 --> 02:46:29.834
<v Speaker 2>greenwald and all these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sicked a lot of people and that </v>

3615
02:46:31.821 --> 02:46:33.980
<v Speaker 2>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giraffe had to be killed.</v>

3616
02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:35.023
<v Speaker 2>That giraffe apparently had killed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least two or three bowls and it was a </v>

3617
02:46:39.531 --> 02:46:43.070
<v Speaker 2>non-viable male and they made it out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was just rare giraffe.</v>

3618
02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:43.933
<v Speaker 2>It's rare because it's old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dark because the dark ones or </v>

3619
02:46:46.371 --> 02:46:48.050
<v Speaker 2>older ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

3620
02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.150
<v Speaker 2>We always get down these rabbit holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think somebody says,</v>

3621
02:46:50.151 --> 02:46:50.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm mad about this photo and the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing we know we're debating the age of </v>

3622
02:46:52.851 --> 02:46:55.070
<v Speaker 2>a fucking single giraffe because like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>

3623
02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:59.330
<v Speaker 2>It does matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter to the extent that</v>

3624
02:46:59.331 --> 02:47:00.164
<v Speaker 2>they try to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand what they're </v>

3625
02:47:01.401 --> 02:47:02.234
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are looking at something that </v>

3626
02:47:03.801 --> 02:47:05.900
<v Speaker 2>they find displeasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3627
02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:07.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right about that.</v>

3628
02:47:07.731 --> 02:47:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And I find a displeasing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3629
02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 2>when I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3630
02:47:10.581 --> 02:47:11.990
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a giraffe hunter.</v>

3631
02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to that part of africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that person,</v>

3632
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.883
<v Speaker 2>but just to look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way as everyone else </v>

3633
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:19.810
<v Speaker 2>because giraffes are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about dress,</v>

3634
02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.653
<v Speaker 2>I had a bit about my act like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only animal that looks fine with </v>

3635
02:47:24.321 --> 02:47:25.530
<v Speaker 2>being in the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3636
02:47:25.810 --> 02:47:26.643
<v Speaker 2>Like another day with no lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just strolling around babies feed </v>

3637
02:47:31.041 --> 02:47:32.240
<v Speaker 2>giraffes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fucking daughter,</v>

3638
02:47:32.241 --> 02:47:33.074
<v Speaker 2>when she was two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I held her up and she had a piece of </v>

3639
02:47:34.701 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 2>leaf and she put it out there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>draft comes over.</v>

3640
02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the only animal that they let </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies feed.</v>

3641
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:42.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't let little kids feed polar </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears.</v>

3642
02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Fucking piller piller fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it be dining on fingers.</v>

3643
02:47:47.841 --> 02:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me your arm man.</v>

3644
02:47:49.850 --> 02:47:51.500
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get.</v>

3645
02:47:52.310 --> 02:47:53.091
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3646
02:47:53.091 --> 02:47:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might make sense.</v>

3647
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the conversation between,</v>

3648
02:47:58.071 --> 02:47:58.904
<v Speaker 2>not between the ricky gervais',</v>
<v Speaker 2>ricky gervais' acts like an asshole in </v>

3649
02:48:02.481 --> 02:48:06.290
<v Speaker 2>this context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He enjoys getting angry people,</v>

3650
02:48:06.291 --> 02:48:07.124
<v Speaker 2>but in his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stereotypical hunter that is in his </v>

3651
02:48:11.331 --> 02:48:14.750
<v Speaker 2>mind what he's fighting against is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

3652
02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3653
02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:16.910
<v Speaker 2>And I would agree and I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3654
02:48:16.911 --> 02:48:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most agree with you.</v>

3655
02:48:18.970 --> 02:48:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Fat guy wants to fly to africa and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elephant and is not even going to eat</v>

3656
02:48:22.881 --> 02:48:23.714
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just wants it because he's </v>

3657
02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:26.820
<v Speaker 2>getting the big eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't.</v>

3658
02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:28.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weird shit.</v>

3659
02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3660
02:48:28.930 --> 02:48:29.763
<v Speaker 2>The problem I have with that is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this specifically calling out that </v>

3661
02:48:32.451 --> 02:48:33.284
<v Speaker 2>single person or a smaller group subset </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hunters that you don't agree with to </v>

3662
02:48:36.861 --> 02:48:41.540
<v Speaker 2>paint the entire group like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that that's the only way they</v>

3663
02:48:41.541 --> 02:48:42.374
<v Speaker 2>can get people to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that what they've done with </v>

3664
02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:47.300
<v Speaker 2>cecil look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they enacted real change.</v>

3665
02:48:47.390 --> 02:48:50.540
<v Speaker 2>There has been real change around a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff with with cecil.</v>

3666
02:48:50.541 --> 02:48:51.374
<v Speaker 2>They enacted real change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately a lot of it has been </v>

3667
02:48:53.121 --> 02:48:57.110
<v Speaker 2>negative with people don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much it costs.</v>

3668
02:48:57.111 --> 02:48:57.944
<v Speaker 2>The people that lived there and about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these hunting concessions get closed </v>

3669
02:49:01.041 --> 02:49:01.874
<v Speaker 2>down and then these animals go wild and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then what happens is poachers just take </v>

3670
02:49:05.121 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 2>over and a lot of the animals get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way</v>

3671
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.860
<v Speaker 1>they did in the United States before </v>
<v Speaker 1>market hunting was outlawed.</v>

3672
02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:13.090
<v Speaker 1>When you look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a concession is,</v>

3673
02:49:13.091 --> 02:49:15.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A concession in this happen,</v>

3674
02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:15.893
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it happened in like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late seventies and early eighties in </v>

3675
02:49:17.341 --> 02:49:18.174
<v Speaker 1>africa where there was especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>antelope and african antelope and all </v>

3676
02:49:22.201 --> 02:49:23.490
<v Speaker 1>these other species that were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

3677
02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:25.710
<v Speaker 1>They were not at the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction,</v>

3678
02:49:25.711 --> 02:49:26.544
<v Speaker 1>but they were suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A concession is essentially a bunch of </v>

3679
02:49:28.921 --> 02:49:30.300
<v Speaker 1>ranch land owners get together and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3680
02:49:30.301 --> 02:49:33.150
<v Speaker 1>let's put a fence around our stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep everything,</v>

3681
02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:35.370
<v Speaker 1>keep poachers out and keep the animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3682
02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in africa wins,</v>

3683
02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:40.680
<v Speaker 1>especially south african.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When concessions became prevalent,</v>

3684
02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:44.370
<v Speaker 1>a wildlife populations skyrocketed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3685
02:49:44.430 --> 02:49:46.350
<v Speaker 1>tripled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled times 10,</v>

3686
02:49:46.530 --> 02:49:48.680
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of analysts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there before.</v>

3687
02:49:48.690 --> 02:49:49.523
<v Speaker 1>They're actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the only way they could </v>

3688
02:49:51.241 --> 02:49:54.060
<v Speaker 1>have value value because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary value.</v>

3689
02:49:54.090 --> 02:49:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not.</v>

3690
02:49:55.950 --> 02:49:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm conflicted about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3691
02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm conflicted about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a thing that worked,</v>

3692
02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.240
<v Speaker 1>but is that the way I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3693
02:50:03.390 --> 02:50:04.223
<v Speaker 1>I've been over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably never go back over there </v>

3694
02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 1>because there's just so many things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this north America I'd like to pursue,</v>

3695
02:50:10.591 --> 02:50:13.380
<v Speaker 1>but like it's something that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

3696
02:50:13.381 --> 02:50:15.750
<v Speaker 1>like I went and did and I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

3697
02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:17.273
<v Speaker 1>this is way too complicated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if there's too much way too much </v>

3698
02:50:20.521 --> 02:50:23.190
<v Speaker 1>american influence based on the money we</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring you over there,</v>

3699
02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:26.850
<v Speaker 1>that isn't rooted in exactly what's good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for africa.</v>

3700
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:27.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think like african hunting is </v>

3701
02:50:31.261 --> 02:50:33.720
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can paint that picture all</v>

3702
02:50:33.721 --> 02:50:35.520
<v Speaker 1>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be like this is,</v>

3703
02:50:35.521 --> 02:50:36.354
<v Speaker 1>it's valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's value for these reasons and nobody </v>

3704
02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:40.890
<v Speaker 1>can really argue like the end result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

3705
02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:41.993
<v Speaker 1>but what's being argued argued the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>result because it's been so much more </v>

3706
02:50:44.281 --> 02:50:47.070
<v Speaker 1>effective than just conservation based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on donations.</v>

3707
02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:47.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people don't understand </v>

3708
02:50:49.201 --> 02:50:50.034
<v Speaker 1>that argue against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong when it comes to the </v>

3709
02:50:52.410 --> 02:50:54.240
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are wrong.</v>

3710
02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You would like to think that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting zebras don't help,</v>

3711
02:50:58.350 --> 02:50:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3712
02:50:59.631 --> 02:51:00.464
<v Speaker 1>That's what they help way more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that go over there to take </v>

3713
02:51:01.891 --> 02:51:02.790
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3714
02:51:02.791 --> 02:51:03.624
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so am I willing to say like get rid of </v>

3715
02:51:04.891 --> 02:51:06.960
<v Speaker 1>that so I can feel better about hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3716
02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:09.630
<v Speaker 1>fuck no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I want there to be more animals.</v>

3717
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:13.110
<v Speaker 1>The number is so different in the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money they contributed.</v>

3718
02:51:13.111 --> 02:51:13.944
<v Speaker 1>This is where people have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll throw some numbers at </v>

3719
02:51:15.781 --> 02:51:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

3720
02:51:18.691 --> 02:51:20.850
<v Speaker 1>people go to safari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's only 2000 people,</v>

3721
02:51:20.851 --> 02:51:21.760
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3722
02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:23.670
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the 2000 people that hunt,</v>

3723
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they hunt and they spend way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking money.</v>

3724
02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:30.010
<v Speaker 1>It costs a lot of money to shoot a line.</v>

3725
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.863
<v Speaker 1>It costs like $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as you find line hunting </v>

3726
02:51:33.541 --> 02:51:34.374
<v Speaker 1>distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that if you </v>

3727
02:51:36.061 --> 02:51:39.300
<v Speaker 1>remove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you take a dictator out.</v>

3728
02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have like a power vacuum.</v>

3729
02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:43.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you replace it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3730
02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:44.893
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just some like on the ground </v>

3731
02:51:46.891 --> 02:51:49.110
<v Speaker 1>things that happened to around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3732
02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:51.810
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do wildlife viewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta cut roads.</v>

3733
02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do wildlife viewing,</v>

3734
02:51:55.050 --> 02:51:57.720
<v Speaker 1>people are going to pay less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means you have to have more people</v>

3735
02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:00.960
<v Speaker 1>encroaching them on these places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wild animals are.</v>

3736
02:52:01.770 --> 02:52:02.603
<v Speaker 1>You have to make parks where humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't go in and you have to be prepared </v>

3737
02:52:06.221 --> 02:52:08.860
<v Speaker 1>when humans get attacked by animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to fucking happen.</v>

3738
02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:09.723
<v Speaker 1>And so it's never as simple as it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is as simple as it seems to say like </v>

3739
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the numbers say that that african trophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting is benefiting.</v>

3740
02:52:16.690 --> 02:52:17.523
<v Speaker 1>But bob life now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it benefiting in the way that </v>

3741
02:52:18.791 --> 02:52:21.430
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks is best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's debatable,</v>

3742
02:52:21.850 --> 02:52:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't sit here and say like,</v>

3743
02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>if we end this today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be more game and be like,</v>

3744
02:52:26.970 --> 02:52:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the reverse is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>

3745
02:52:29.501 --> 02:52:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Probably the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might,</v>

3746
02:52:31.270 --> 02:52:33.130
<v Speaker 1>it'll hurt your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the reverse.</v>

3747
02:52:33.290 --> 02:52:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3748
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:35.920
<v Speaker 1>what's going on right now in africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3749
02:52:35.950 --> 02:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>What were the exact area that cecil the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion happened in,</v>

3750
02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:42.520
<v Speaker 1>is that they had a call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 lions.</v>

3751
02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:43.653
<v Speaker 1>They had to shoot 200 lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they had to pay someone to </v>

3752
02:52:45.791 --> 02:52:47.820
<v Speaker 1>go and shoot these lines because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

3753
02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:49.113
<v Speaker 1>their population had gotten so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were decimating the angelo </v>

3754
02:52:51.371 --> 02:52:52.204
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all the antelope and all the </v>

3755
02:52:53.411 --> 02:52:55.990
<v Speaker 1>different animals that the lines were </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunting,</v>

3756
02:52:55.991 --> 02:52:58.660
<v Speaker 1>they were destroying them because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to eat a lot man,</v>

3757
02:52:58.690 --> 02:53:01.090
<v Speaker 1>but you're a 600 pound cat and all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

3758
02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:03.730
<v Speaker 1>You're a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a meat processor on four legs,</v>

3759
02:53:03.731 --> 02:53:04.790
<v Speaker 1>brow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no.</v>

3760
02:53:04.810 --> 02:53:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey listen man,</v>

3761
02:53:06.250 --> 02:53:09.190
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lay off for a couple of weeks,</v>

3762
02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:12.000
<v Speaker 1>listen another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

3763
02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I know you really like to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

3764
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just breeding unchecked.</v>

3765
02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Their populations quickly got to very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmanageable number.</v>

3766
02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems it's never as simple as it </v>

3767
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:31.980
<v Speaker 1>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mountain lions in California,</v>

3768
02:53:32.030 --> 02:53:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Washington and Oregon this year in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon and Washington to people,</v>

3769
02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:39.010
<v Speaker 1>poor killed one in each state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't happened in 100 years.</v>

3770
02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:40.173
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a lot of people that say </v>

3771
02:53:41.111 --> 02:53:43.840
<v Speaker 1>that's an anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened nonetheless.</v>

3772
02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an anomaly.</v>

3773
02:53:46.720 --> 02:53:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's also a reality is it happens are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators and they're Big and they're.</v>

3774
02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They've killed I think 55 bears in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater yellowstone ecosystem this year.</v>

3775
02:53:55.361 --> 02:53:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Just probably that number could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>skewed In some way for me,</v>

3776
02:53:59.591 --> 02:54:02.530
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's what I heard a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>black bears,</v>

3777
02:54:02.531 --> 02:54:05.400
<v Speaker 1>right that invade into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was,</v>

3778
02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:06.243
<v Speaker 1>this was all grizzly bears that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>either been hit by cars or nuisance or </v>

3779
02:54:10.541 --> 02:54:12.820
<v Speaker 1>we're getting around somebody cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been shot.</v>

3780
02:54:12.820 --> 02:54:13.653
<v Speaker 1>I think if that's the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look that up and confirm </v>

3781
02:54:15.471 --> 02:54:18.520
<v Speaker 1>them right about that because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty serious accusation if I'm wrong,</v>

3782
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but you know that happens in that this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no simple.</v>

3783
02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:24.273
<v Speaker 1>there's no simple way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just here with mountain lions mean </v>

3784
02:54:26.981 --> 02:54:29.440
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion hunting is outlawed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

3785
02:54:29.441 --> 02:54:30.274
<v Speaker 1>but they killed the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions and the way they killed </v>

3786
02:54:32.411 --> 02:54:35.290
<v Speaker 1>them as they have to hire people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to use public funds,</v>

3787
02:54:35.291 --> 02:54:36.124
<v Speaker 1>these tax dollars and they hire a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dogs to go catch these fucking </v>

3788
02:54:40.301 --> 02:54:41.440
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>KIll them.</v>

3789
02:54:41.740 --> 02:54:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3790
02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:43.313
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hours ago we talked about the north </v>

3791
02:54:45.101 --> 02:54:48.670
<v Speaker 1>american model of wildlife conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a thing.</v>

3792
02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:50.553
<v Speaker 1>It's not infallible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty fucking close in my </v>

3793
02:54:51.791 --> 02:54:54.580
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good system and there's more</v>

3794
02:54:54.581 --> 02:54:56.650
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we didn't cover but shit,</v>
