00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.560
Oh sweet baby Jesus on a pogo stick.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.420
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.470
Ting is a no bullshit and mobile service.

4
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:17.810
What does that mean ladies and gentlemen?
What does that mean?

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.820
I means Tang eliminates all the shit that's annoying about going to a regular

6
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.990
cell from provider,

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.620
but at the same time they give you the same service that you would get if you

8
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:31.490
had sprint.
Sprint is um,
their backbone.
That's what they use.

9
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:35.660
So all of their data,
their phone calls,
everything is done through sprint.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.330
But you don't have to deal with contracts.

11
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:40.730
You don't have any early termination fees,

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.420
no bundling or ride along servageon services,

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.230
no overages on charges or penalties would.

14
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.700
The Way Tim has it set up is you pay for what you use.

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.900
If you use less,
you pay less.
If you use more,
you pay more.
And it,

16
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.390
it all makes sense.
It's real easy to follow.

17
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:03.050
And I personally believe that it is the model that all cell phone companies will

18
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.700
be forced to adopt in the future.
Contracts are nonsense.
It's gross.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.670
You don't want to use them anymore,
so then all of a sudden you have to pay.

20
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.300
What does this LG flexes as some new shit or phone.
If he says it totally curved,

21
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.940
what have you sit on it the wrong way,
the ship breaks and stuff,

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.070
but it's probably good for your front pocket price,

23
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.710
like just curves or ride around your leg.
It probably feels great.

24
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.810
Everybody sideways,
whatever on your cock bag and take a lot of texts.

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
If you're one of those uh,
Doug Benson characters like Doug,
Doug switched it,

26
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.290
but he used to have it so every time someone would tweet it would show up on his

27
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:37.700
phone,
his phone with buzz tweeters,
his name,
he fixed that.
He got,

28
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.790
he wised up anyway,
the phones that they do have on Tang,

29
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.250
they're there all the top end android phones,
they,
uh,
Samsung Galaxy note three,

30
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.410
which is what I have.
They have the HTC one,

31
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:53.270
which is pretty fucking bad ass as well.
They have the,
uh,
the galaxy s four,

32
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.800
which is another outstanding phone.

33
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.610
Tang has basically everything you can need as far as a cell phones,

34
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.060
all the top end android phones and as far as service,

35
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.550
they just cut out all the bullshit and they save a lot of people money.

36
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:09.551
98% of people would saved money on Ting and if you go to rogan.ting.com you can

37
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:15.440
save 25 bucks off of any new device.

38
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.780
It is an outstanding cell phone service.

39
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.620
It is a service that many of our friends use and uh,
are very happy with.

40
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.860
I've never had one person complain about it.
Absolutely.

41
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:28.040
The best android phones that you could buy as well.
All the cool ones.

42
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.010
All the new shit.
Do you think you could do this for a month?

43
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.730
Have one of these flip phones?
Could if I was like one of those contrarion guys,

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.920
I was hanging around with a bunch of old dudes and Dallas,

45
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:39.800
this old karate guys and they all had flip phones was hilarious.
Yeah.

46
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:43.280
Chuck Norris is a fucking flip phone.
Chuck Norris.
So I flipped open his phone.

47
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.410
Bob Wall from enter the Dragon.
We'll flip phone.

48
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.130
I think there is something nice too about the idea of it only being a phone

49
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.030
dynamic examiner razor right now.
Yeah,
it was to have a razor in your pocket,

50
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.690
but it's also nice to be able to do everything from one device and texts and all

51
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:56.930
that.

52
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.000
Imagine if you had one phone and then you had to someone in a dress and then you

53
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.480
can send me the contact information.
Uh,
Shit.

54
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.960
You can't copy paste.
You can't do anything.
Fuck all that man.

55
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.260
That's just the past.
You don't want to have a carrier pigeon either.
All right.

56
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:16.120
Fuck a smoke signal.
That's what I'm saying.
Brian.
Fuck a smoke signal.

57
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.920
You heard me?
I'm controversial.
I don't know about to sell GE flex though.

58
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.000
I don't know.
It might be cool.
It might be annoying too.
It seems cool.

59
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.630
I as I like to see,
I think eventually they're going to have roll up phones.

60
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.300
I mean it's gonna be like a scroll.
You got parchment to hear you hear you.

61
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.290
Are you going to roll out your phone?

62
00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:35.440
It's gonna be one of those flip bracelets at the kids.

63
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.121
Where have you ever seen it?

64
00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:40.870
Where it's like a big metal thing that you can tap on rounds.
Albrey has a,

65
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.610
I'm one of those electric cars.

66
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.110
When I was Teslas I thought those things were nonsense until I got in one holy

67
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:51.640
shit is that they have the dopest screen I've ever seen in a car.

68
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.410
It's the whole front thing is a screen like the panel in the middle.
I did.

69
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.730
Does the air conditioning the radio?
It's a giant computer screen dude.

70
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.540
It's pretty weird.
Shit freezes up your whole car.
Yeah,

71
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.070
your car is probably going to crash for sure.
Yeah.

72
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:09.190
And if there's any sort of electrical like shortage or anything like that.
Some,

73
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.430
if your car gets hit by lightning it's toast.
What is that first year model?

74
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.350
That's crazy.
I think it's a,

75
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.770
they've had cars before cause they had the Tesla sports car,

76
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:20.230
which was also a battery controlled car.

77
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.890
But that was a tricky car because all the batteries were in the ass end of the

78
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.250
car and he's a really light car so it's like one of those old Porsche's.

79
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.330
The old Porsche's have the engine hanging out back and it changes the dynamics

80
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.650
of the handling.
Like when you go round corners the asset and wants a pop around,

81
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.200
it's called oversteer.
Like some people like it.

82
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.550
It's kind of fun to drive like that,

83
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.650
but you have to get used to it and know what it's going to do.

84
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.910
If you're used to driving a regular car and you used to like go in sideways and

85
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.490
like a corvette or something like that and you'd be getting one of those things,

86
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.340
it's a very different sort of a dynamic.
They look cool though.

87
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.410
You seen those little plot,
the little plastic thing.

88
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.250
They look like little fun matchbox cars.
They look like a little lotus.

89
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.810
That's what they look like.
And uh,
apparently they're pretty fast too.
Uh,

90
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.030
and all electric,
you know,
which cool.

91
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:08.200
In La you could actually really do it electrically because you could have solar.

92
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.610
It's charging your car.

93
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.970
I mean a lot of people have that now where they have just a solar charger to

94
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.500
their car so their is not hooked up to the grid at all.
Wow.
Yeah.
Pretty wicked.

95
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.000
Has nothing to do with tango,
rogan.ting.com go get yourself some bitches.

99
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.570
What does that mean?
What does it mean?
It means that's what art is about.

100
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.700

We started selling these new things called warrior bars.
They're fucking awesome.

110

Why fuck around any longer?
Oh,

125
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:07.100
we have a show Friday night at the Ice House.
It's called Thunderpussy.

126
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.950
And a,

127
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.730
if you've never been to a Thunderpussy show is not a regular comedy show would

128
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.893
get a bunch of fucking

129
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.410
<v 3>with Thunderpussy.
Is is,</v>

130
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
it's a show where no one plans what they're going to say.
Everyone goes onstage,

131
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.550
fucked up,
the audience calls out ideas and everyone just starts talking shit.

132
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.050
Sometimes it's awesome.
But last time it was awesome.

133
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.090
It's cool because it's a unique comedy show.
You,

134
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.870
you'll never see another like these comics doing these bits because they're just

135
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:39.350
making them up on the fly while they're on stage.
Yeah.
And you can't,

136
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.070
you can't come on stage with some fucking material.
That's one of the roles.

137
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.020
You're not allowed to do that.
We'll get any material.

138
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.470
That's a joke you wrote that you weak bitch.
Uh,

those,
those are fucking dope websites.

145
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.150
Uh,
there was too many websites.
So bunch of people should've won that contest.

146
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:23.870
We should add a hundred winners anyway.
Uh,

Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

156
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.700
World traveler,
internationally known,

157
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.820
locally accepted bad mother fucker out doing ridiculous shit all over the world

and not slowing down anytime soon.
Are you the new Rupert Murdoch?

159
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.770
Keep hearing you're the new Rupert Murdoch.
What does that mean?

160
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.910
I don't know why I keep coming on here.
Shit.

161
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.000
<v 4>Oh,
I love you.
I love it.

I love everybody in.</v>

162
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.380
<v 3>No,
I know.
I'm not the next week.
What's the latest man?</v>

163
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.630
Where the fuck have you been?
Neat.
Where are you getting back from?

164
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.830
Every time I've emailed you or talk to you or Twitter or text message and you're

165
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:44.580
in the middle of fucking nowhere and some dark places.
You're so funny.

166
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.290
We were talking before the show and he's like,
yeah,

167
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.660
I should get you to do some of these things.
I can send you the North Pole.
Like,

168
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.320
bitch,
I'm not going to the fucking North Pole.
You don't know me man.

169
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.460
Good one though.
Easy one.
What are you saying?

170
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.570
The North Pole is not good or easy.
That's ridiculous.

171
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.100
It's polar bears up there,
right?

172
00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:05.250
And there's polars is a salt south pole pole arose.

173
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.720
Which one is programs or North Pole.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So one of them has penguins,

174
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.410
one of them does it.
South Poles,
penguin,
penguin,
north pole doesn't polar bear.

175
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.510
Why would that possibly be easy?
Well

176
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.420
<v 4>it's a bitch to get to because you have to like fly thousand times and then go,</v>

177
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.720
you know,

178
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.720
with a sled and dogs and ice helicopters and Shit and whenever she,

179
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.610
but a,
it's a,
it's a crazy story.
What's going on there?
That's like a,
you know,

180
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:35.960
world war three happening up there.

181
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.090
<v 3>So this is the place where what's going on in,</v>

182
00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:41.760
in the middle of the North Pole now.

183
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.900
<v 4>So the ice is melting,
right?
And,
and a that's leading to two things.</v>

184
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.770
One opening up of passages so Russians can come right across,

185
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.670
which is great because now it looks like we're going back to the Cold War,
but,

186
00:10:55.671 --> 00:11:00.560
um,
it's also just tons of oil.
Tons of minerals can now be sort of,

187
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.090
you know,
mind because the environment,
Isis will just fuck it up even more.

188
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.870
So what's happening is everyone's amassing huge,
uh,

189
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.050
sort of caches of arms.
So,
uh,
you know,

190
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:13.820
the Russians obviously are getting up there.

191
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.720
Everyone's planting flags on the seabed floors.
This is ours.
No,
this is ours.

192
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.960
So the scan,
these are trying to get in their candidates trying to get in there.

193
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.670
Both are being destroyed by the Russians and the Americans,
Chinese are in there.

194
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.180
Everybody's getting there with subs,
you know,
uh,

195
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.120
lots of naval naval buildup,

196
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:36.050
but huge arms buildup going on there because that's going to be the next sort
of,

197
00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:40.130
uh,
not only the,
the sort of transportation routes,
but also,
you know,

198
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.910
all the sort of natural minerals,
rare earth minerals,
oil,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

199
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.570
<v 3>Essentially it's just like when the Bering straight back during the ice age is</v>

200
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:54.370
connecting the United States to Asia and then it went away.
Yeah.
Now new passages

201
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.450
<v 2>like that are opening up.</v>

202
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.790
<v 4>Correct.
So the whole North Pole is melting,
so you can,</v>

203
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.610
what's happening now is you can actually,
you know what,

204
00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:06.410
when a lot of the earlier explorers we're trying to get to China by going around

205
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.650
the north and now that's opening up.

206
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.660
So it's opening up north of,
of,

207
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.640
of Scandinavia so that Russia can actually go right around Scandinavia because

208
00:12:16.641 --> 00:12:19.160
they never really had it fresh water year round port.

209
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.340
And so that's a big deal for them.
Um,
but you know,
same thing for Canada,

210
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:25.790
the same thing for the states.
China.

211
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.140
They're all trying to get up there and lay sort of rights to all the minerals

212
00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:32.720
and all the oil.
It's up there as well as the passage.

213
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.670
<v 2>How does that work?
Like who decides who owned that since it's really,</v>

214
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.130
what was it before it was an international waters?
That was it.

215
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.120
<v 4>Well,
yeah.
I mean people had laid claim to it,</v>

216
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:45.930
but you couldn't know any went there.
So who the hell cares?
You know,

217
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.570
what does it matter?
You couldn't get through because it was all iced up.

218
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.750
So now what's happening is a massive land grab.

219
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.020
People are just planning their flags and saying,
no,
this is ours now.

220
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.850
This is not yours.
This is our,
and they're sort of fighting it out.

221
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.320
But basically up there might makes,
right?
So if I got my ships up there,

222
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:06.010
I got my guns up there,
I got my air force up there,
guess what?
It's mine.

223
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.310
<v 2>Wow.</v>

224
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.720
And it's so fascinating how over the last few years they've discovered all these

225
00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:15.020
massive,
massive supplies of oil up,

226
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.160
huge reserves of oil,
shale oil,

227
00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:22.490
and all weird oil that you have to fucking,
but what's the,

228
00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:25.490
what's the kind of in Utah that they found where you have to burn it and it

229
00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:29.630
creates all this horrible carbon's being emitted into your environment in order

230
00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:30.464
to process?

231
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.750
<v 4>Yeah,
there's all different,</v>

232
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:36.490
I mean the worst oil that they have for the environment is in Canada is the tar

233
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:39.130
sands where they have to take all the fresh water,

234
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:42.550
boil up the sand to get out the oil boiler,
you know,

235
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.880
to get the oil out costs tons and tons of money and whatever.

236
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:50.620
But because the oil so expensive now that it's become economically feasible,

237
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.850
why?
And that's the stuff that pollutes the environment pretty heavily.
Well,

238
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.460
it all does,
but I mean tar sands,
it's shocking.
It's like really,
really bad.

239
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.590
<v 2>I think that's what they were talking about in Utah.
I'm not sure what they're,</v>

240
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.470
they're trying to figure out a way it'd be tar sands.

241
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.500
They found more oil in Utah are ready for this then humans have ever used ever.

242
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.960
So there's no way you're going to keep those fucking dirty criminals from

243
00:14:14.961 --> 00:14:17.360
pulling out of the ground.
I'm fucking up everything.
I mean,

244
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.330
<v 4>if it's tar sand,
I don't know about Utah specifically.</v>

245
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:21.710
I know about candidates very,

246
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:25.780
very bad because they take the whole La Lake Athabaska sort of uh,

247
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.130
a watershed and they use the water to boil out the,
the,

248
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.930
the,
the,
the,
the oil,

249
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.850
and then you have all of this sort of chemical sand that they have to chuck.

250
00:14:37.851 --> 00:14:41.540
You have all the water's destroyed.
And then obviously you've got the oil.

251
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.260
<v 2>It's oil shale.
That's a good thing.
Yeah.
Shale.
That's,
so that is shale oil.</v>

252
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.820
Yeah.
Well

253
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.350
<v 4>that's what you got it.
There's,
there's,</v>

254
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.210
you got to go down and there's fracking to get natural gas in this fracking and

255
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:54.490
blowing up to get the shallow,

256
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.380
<v 3>well,
there is a lot of that shit out there apparently.</v>

257
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.830
It's interesting that they're just finding this over the last decade or so.

258
00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:05.580
They knew about it,
but it was too expensive.
It wasn't,

259
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.940
it wasn't economically viable.
But now because it's $100 a barrel,

260
00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.620
they're like fuck,
blow the shit out of everything.

261
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.490
So they knew about it and Utah too,
they knew about all these ones.

262
00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:18.030
They knew that you could get it.
Oh fracking isn't anything new.
Right.
You know,

263
00:15:18.031 --> 00:15:22.740
uh,
oil sands,
tar sands or anything new.
Cheryl is a new,
it's just,

264
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.200
Oh you know,
we can,
we can,

265
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.740
it's now economically viable tax and get this shit out.

266
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.040
Cause it was too expensive before.

267
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.440
It's the same thing was using co two and water to sort of,
you know,

268
00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:37.440
frack or to pump out the rest of the oil and wells cause we didn't get all the

269
00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:39.200
oil out before,
only what was pressurized.

270
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.710
There's a thing that comes up when you talk about anything that causes some sort

271
00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:47.850
of environmental hazard where you have two different types of people that

272
00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:51.690
automatically jump on the argument.
There's the type of people that are like,

273
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.321
oh my God,

274
00:15:52.321 --> 00:15:56.370
we have to save Alz and all of the trees or whatever the fuck his growing up

275
00:15:56.371 --> 00:15:58.200
there.
And then there's these other people,

276
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.650
these other people that almost universally like are not financially successful

277
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.160
but support hardcore republican ideals,

278
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.600
including like the sacrificing of the environment for it,

279
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.370
for some sort of an economic gain.
I don't understand.
Stand

280
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.740
<v 4>it.
And I just did a piece on Greenland that's going to be airing on our HBO show</v>

281
00:16:19.741 --> 00:16:21.650
tomorrow.
And I've been doing a lot of press around.

282
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.660
It's interesting cause I did a piece on sea level rise last season and generally

283
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:31.380
about 90% of our comments are like,
you guys fucking rock.
It was great.

284
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.150
And then there's 10% and 80% of the comments all of a sudden on the

285
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:39.900
environmental stuff were negative.
And I was like,
how's this even happening?

286
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.140
And there was a,
uh,
like a,

287
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.760
a study was done that if the first four comments on an environmental thing or

288
00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:52.290
any,
uh,
like news piece are negative,
then people negate the,
the,

289
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:53.124
the actual piece.

290
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.390
So they spent hundreds of millions of dollars for bloggers and people to just go

291
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:00.930
out and do comments so that anything launches,
they sit there and they,
and they,

292
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.860
they,
they,
you know,
say that this is bad or not true,
whatever.

293
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.290
For me,
look,
here's the deal.
You know,
when I talked to scientists all the time,

294
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.980
uh,
for this,
uh,
Green Line piece,

295
00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:18.930
I talked to the chief climatologists that NASA and I said,
okay,
so how,

296
00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:21.330
how,
how,
how much of this is,
is manmade?

297
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:23.810
Cause I went to Greenland and it's melting and,
and,

298
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:28.380
and in Greenland is going to melt and it's 24 feet of sea level rise.

299
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.720
So if the sea level rises is 24 feet,

300
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.950
then 80% of the world's cities go under water.
So I said,
okay,

301
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.800
you know,
how much of this is manmade?
And he's,
he's,

302
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:41.160
he's a conservative scientist.
He's like a NASA guy.

303
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:45.000
He's not like some crazy tree hugging and guy.
And he's like,
well,
100% of it.

304
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.120
I said,
hold on.
What do you mean 100% of them?
It was just natural.
It was,

305
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.470
it's 100% like if you look at it,
and I actually,
when I was talking to him,

306
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.011
he's like,

307
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.510
if we cut our carbon emissions by 80% it's still going to continue for the next

308
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.870
500 years.
Global warming,
but,
or at least,

309
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.480
but we just slowed down the pace of it.
And I'm like,
well how long,
you know,

310
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.570
how much of Greenland is going to melt?
He goes,
well all of it,

311
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.660
it's just a question of how fast is it going to be?
500 years,

312
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:11.820
it can be 50 years is going to be,
you know,
150 years.

313
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.800
And so I actually kind of got mad at the scientists cause I'm like,
he's,

314
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:19.680
he's saying this as if it's boring.
And I'm saying,
hold on,

315
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.550
this is the global scientific consensus.
And then I'm like,

316
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.310
well people in America don't understand that.
I don't understand that.

317
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:28.740
And I do this for a living that,
you know,

318
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.080
because we did a thing on the Texas drought because we,
you know,

319
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:34.500
there was a drought here in California.
Everybody's like global warming,

320
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:35.910
global warming.
And in Texas,

321
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:38.880
they've had a drought for three years and they denied climate change.

322
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.240
Like Rick Perry has said,
it's not true,
the governor of the state.

323
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.970
And then you sit there and say,
okay,
well how is that possible?

324
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:46.550
So we went to talk to people and they're like,
yeah,

325
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.630
climate change has been denied.
I mean it's,
it's been disproven.
And,
and,

326
00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:54.780
and that I find insidious because they know it's not true.
The,

327
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.300
the fossil fuel companies.
No,
it's not true.
The car companies.

328
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.130
And though it's not true,
the politicians,
no,
it's not true.

329
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.860
They know what the global,
uh,
consensus is the scientific consensus.
And yet they,

330
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.500
they,
they fund and,
and,
and say that it's not happening.

331
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.580
And that's bad because they're fucking all of humanity and the future of

332
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.010
humanity for,
for short term profits.

333
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:16.440
And that's what's insidious about climate change denial.

334
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.210
<v 1>It's very insidious.
And it's very fascinating to me.
This play on these people,</v>

335
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:23.130
these no nonsense type people.

336
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.760
There's a mentality that people adopt where they don't want to be fools.
Right?

337
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.200
And it's the no nonsense mentality.
And I've,
I've documented this,

338
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:34.200
this is like something that I've really been studying for quite a while.

339
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.130
There's people that in spite of all the evidence in front of them,

340
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.400
they want to believe the official story on almost everything and almost always

341
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:42.810
take the conservative viewpoint.

342
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.910
And a lot of times that conservative viewpoint is who they are,

343
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.280
the very type of people who they are,

344
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.980
it's against them and yet they still support it.

345
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.870
A lot of them are hard working blue collar people and they have this idea that

346
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.450
somehow or another in the future,

347
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.620
they want to be able to make money freely.
So,
you know,

348
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:09.300
I don't want the government stepping in and stopping all this shale because I

349
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:13.260
could step in and maybe do a little shale mine and myself and start making

350
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:15.480
millions of dollars.
And right now they're not.

351
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:18.870
Right now they're the ones who are being punished by a lot of these ideas that

352
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.620
pushing forth themselves.
It's very strange.
But

353
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.840
<v 4>if you ever talked to,
and I agree with you,</v>

354
00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:27.380
and I always found it incredibly confusing,

355
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.660
and we just did this story on,

356
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.520
on vets returning from Afghanistan and Iraq and how they're overprescribed

357
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:38.690
overmedicated oh yeah.
By the Va.
It's a huge problem.

358
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.740
What's working folks who support big business?
Well that's it.
And,
and,

359
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:46.220
and if you talk to the disillusioned veterans veterans,

360
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:48.040
of which I have tremendous respectful,
by the way,

361
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.690
but coming back from these wars that were fought for economic reasons,
for oil,

362
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:58.000
and,
and when they realize that,
they're like,
oh,
we were duped,
you know,
the,

363
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.350
you know,
we went over there to fight the good fight.
There is no,
it does no good.

364
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.450
It's no good fight.
We went over there to fight for oil.

365
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.190
<v 2>And by the way,
there's never been a good fight.
Right?</v>

366
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.350
<v 4>I mean,
look,
you could say World War II,
you know,
and that's his bad.
Yeah,
no,</v>

367
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.510
very bad people.
You know,

368
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.680
I would say that Iraq now is,
is pretty much a given.

369
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.300
There were no weapons of mass destruction.

370
00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:22.820
He wasn't even doing anything without God.
It was a secular regime.

371
00:21:22.821 --> 00:21:26.420
They were enemies.
We went in to get oil.
And I think,
you know,

372
00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:27.790
if you look at Afghanistan now,

373
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.820
we just did a piece on Afghanistan and to Taliban and running,
uh,

374
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.170
south Afghanistan and the northern lights are running northern Afghanistan.

375
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:36.830
And the minute we pull out,

376
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.740
it's going to be the Taliban take over the south just like they did before.

377
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:44.150
And $1 trillion in hundreds of thousands of lives are just going to be wasted

378
00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:47.810
for nothing because alcaide is going to be in with the Taliban again,

379
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.530
which is why we went in there in the first place.
So anyway,

380
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.560
not that what I'm trying to get at is I think that a lot of the mentality,

381
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.483
you know,

382
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:03.550
people are used for economic purposes and that I find insidious people should

383
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:04.350
not be,

384
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.570
<v 2>it is not just insidious,
it's,
it's,</v>

385
00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:10.920
it's maddening because a lot of those people who really signed up to serve their

386
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:15.150
country,
correct.
Real legit heroes.
Correct.
And they were used.
Correct.

387
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.660
And if you go back and read Smedley butlers,

388
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:22.840
war is just a racket from 1930 something.

389
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.650
He was a major brigadier major general character.

390
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.930
I forget what his exact title and rank was,

391
00:22:27.931 --> 00:22:30.360
but he was a well respected military man and spelt,

392
00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:32.550
it's whole life and the service of the country.

393
00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:37.551
And then realized when he was retiring that he only existed to go out there and

394
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.030
make sure things were safe for bankers,
clear the air for oil manufacturers,

395
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:49.070
whatever it was that he was really doing.
He thought he was over there,
you know,

396
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.810
promoting freedom.
Sure.
Keeping America safe.

397
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.810
And he wrote this a fascinating and very damning piece,

398
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.020
and this isn't in the 1930s so it's always been like that.

399
00:22:58.021 --> 00:23:02.010
It's always been this double hustle that even the people involved in it don't

400
00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:05.670
realize they're a part of the hustle,
the very most important part to machine.

401
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.880
The hammer itself doesn't realize it's part of the hustle.

402
00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:10.380
The very guys pulling the trigger.

403
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.110
<v 4>Well,
if they were,
if they realize that they wouldn't,
they wouldn't go fight.</v>

404
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.240
<v 2>It's so insidious that you could figure out a way to get someone to do that.</v>

405
00:23:17.241 --> 00:23:19.970
And the way you get them to do that is actually get them to love their country.

406
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.810
I can actually get real heroes.
Wow.
You know,

407
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.680
<v 4>you're,
you're preying off patriotism.</v>

408
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.170
<v 2>It's that thing too though,
man,
that I'm a good person and I'm a no nonsense,</v>

409
00:23:31.171 --> 00:23:31.771
good person.

410
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:36.060
And that's the same shit that gets prayed upon with this whole global warming

411
00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:36.960
denial thing.

412
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.350
<v 4>Well,
I don't understand because whenever I talk to someone,
I'm like,
okay,</v>

413
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:43.950
I'm a gambling guy.
You know,
I,
you know,
even if it's a 1% chance,

414
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:49.190
so you're so sure it's 100% sure it's 100% it's a fucking hoax.

415
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.290
Right?
What if it's 1%?

416
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.880
What if it's 5% what if it's 10% don't you want to fucking hedge your bet?

417
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.840
Well and say,
because total global economic or sorry,

418
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.490
environmental disaster and breakdown versus,
okay,
we're all okay,

419
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.900
don't you want to hedge your bet?

420
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.680
Wouldn't you want to hedge your bet against a complete,
uh,

421
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:14.510
environmental disaster?
I would.
I'm a gambling man.
I'll bet 1% to,
to say,
okay,

422
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:18.230
it's like insurance when you play back.
Right?
Or,
or,
or,
or when they've got a 21.

423
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.030
Okay,
I'll,
I'll,
you know,
I'll take that insurance because even if it's 1% true,

424
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.480
I'm convinced it's 100% true,
but even if it's 1% you don't,

425
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:27.314
you want to hedge your bet.

426
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.960
<v 2>I think it's a confirmation bias issue that these ideas fit into there no</v>

427
00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:35.620
nonsense mentality.
The no nonsense mentalities,
almost like a,

428
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.940
it's almost like a religion.
It's come on,
Oswaldo acted alone.
Stop.

429
00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:42.880
It was the same guy.
Like they're not even looking into it.

430
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.300
They just go with this no nonsense idea.
Even in the face of it

431
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.070
<v 4>all sorts of Wa.
It's interesting in Texas and,
and,
and,
and because you have a,</v>

432
00:24:51.071 --> 00:24:55.040
a loss of a whole way of life because all the cows are dying.

433
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:56.240
They've had a three year drought.

434
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.660
They've either sold them off where they've died and so you sit there and say,

435
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:03.260
okay,
in the face of all your fucking cattle,

436
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:06.440
which was Texas for the longest period of time,
you know,

437
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.110
dying because of this prolonged drought.

438
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.210
Now you have people who were like incredible deniers and people saying,

439
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:16.580
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
that's not true.
Saying,
actually,

440
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.970
there might be something to this shit and I don't know what it is,

441
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:23.480
but we got to look into it and we can't just pray for fucking rain anymore.

442
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.500
There's been congress,

443
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.230
there was a Republican congressmen that we talked to who said like,

444
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.470
I was just a climate change denier because Al Gore was for it,

445
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.460
therefore I was again.
And then when I did the research,
I realized,
Holy Shit,

446
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:36.110
this is,
there's,
there's something to this.

447
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:41.120
And he got drummed out of the party and lost a seat.
Wow.
And,
and look,
it's,
it's,

448
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:44.450
it's,
uh,
it's big political business down there and it's an oil state.

449
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.990
It's an oil state now because there's no more cattle.
So there all the water,

450
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:50.210
they have no water for the cattle they're using for fracking.

451
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.950
So you sit there and you say,
look,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

452
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.150
it's gotten so bad now that even people who have been deniers for so long are

453
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:02.150
saying,
you know what?
Fuck,
okay,
what the fuck are we going to do?

454
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.060
<v 2>Have you seen the photos of,
I think it's Lake Travis Travis.</v>

455
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.650
It's not down to nothing.

456
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.190
There's like boats that were like sitting on the shore in front of these

457
00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:16.090
people's a million dollar estates and now these things are in the middle of this

458
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:20.560
field.
It's like there's grass growing up.
I mean,
it's not going.
And by the way,

459
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:24.880
that's green Texas.
Yeah,
Texas is,
yeah,
you're right.
Nobody raped.

460
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.840
That's Austin.
You know,
we're talking about Austin,
which is,
you know,
is it about,

461
00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:31.100
is a Rainey's against like we do that.
That's,

462
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:34.900
that's a kind photograph that's happening in California as well.

463
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.810
We were a at lake to hone and lake to hone.

464
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.540
Used to have some of the best bass fishing in northern cal and southern

465
00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:43.850
California.
That is a great spot.
They had this great there,
right?

466
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.660
It was just filled with large mouth bass and it's a private,
um,
the,
the whole,

467
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.230
um,
ranch 270,000 acres is private,

468
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.000
so he couldn't just get in there to fish.

469
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.270
So they would let people come in and fish keep the employees would fish.

470
00:26:57.271 --> 00:27:00.540
Like people would pay to fish there.
It's fucking gone.
Now.
It's gone.

471
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.780
Almost all the fish are dead.
The water's like six inches deep.

472
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.480
Like you can walk across the entire lake.
Now,

473
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.000
<v 4>question for you.
When that happens,
when lakes are disappearing,</v>

474
00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:14.180
Lake Travis to disappear,
all these plays are disappearing and people still say,

475
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.190
fuck you Joe.
It's fucking natural.
Occurrence of things is bullshit.

476
00:27:19.191 --> 00:27:21.860
There's no climate change.
Fuck you.
What do you say to them?

477
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.440
<v 2>Well,
the guy,
the last guy that I had a conversation with,</v>

478
00:27:24.441 --> 00:27:26.810
they told me that it was just a natural cycle.

479
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.040
He's a guy from Jujitsu and I was like,
you know,
I said,
well,

480
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.490
there's always been natural cycles.
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's true.
You know,

481
00:27:34.491 --> 00:27:37.340
there's the,
the climate on the earth is varied widely,

482
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.860
but it doesn't mean that human intervention,

483
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:44.660
what we've caused can't play a big part in accelerating that and accelerating it

484
00:27:44.661 --> 00:27:46.190
and unmanageable way.

485
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.760
And he didn't really have an answer to that cause he wasn't,
no,
not skin.

486
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.110
He was a no nonsense guy.

487
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:54.960
He was just a young military kid who has this idea in his head that,
you know,

488
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.640
there's a lot of hippy bullshit being flown around there without about the

489
00:27:58.641 --> 00:28:00.710
environment.
Well,
I think that's the problem.
You know,

490
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:05.350
Al Gore made $1 billion telling everybody that he's the first green billionaire

491
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:08.210
general know that.
Okay.
It doesn't mean totally right.

492
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.110
<v 4>Well,
the interesting thing about Al Gore and I find it very interesting,</v>

493
00:28:12.111 --> 00:28:14.300
not that I,
I'm an Al Gore lover.
I uh,

494
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:19.610
I came up actually hating a tipper Gore cause uh,
she was censorship,

495
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.960
et Cetera,
et cetera.
All the rap lyrics.
She exactly,
exactly.
And uh,

496
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.150
but you got to look at Al Gore and say he wasn't,
uh,

497
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.990
like a big l liberal.

498
00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:34.640
He was like a sort of sense using tobacco guy from the south.
Like,
you know,

499
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:39.350
centrist,
you know,
in,
in most countries in the world,
he'd be sort of center,

500
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:41.480
right?
Conservative dude.

501
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.000
He came out of politics being an environmentalist.
Now he didn't do that mate.
Oh,

502
00:28:47.001 --> 00:28:50.520
I don't know.
I May,
I don't know the guys very well,
but you know,

503
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.630
he came out freaking out about the environment.
Why?

504
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.260
Because all the shit that he learned in politics,

505
00:28:57.261 --> 00:28:59.420
all the behind the scenes shit that we don't know about,

506
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.280
freaked him out so much that he said,

507
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.250
I'm going to actually go out and do this movie and say the environment is
fucked.

508
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.670
Hey,
by the way,
this isn't like Greenpeace dude,
this hippie,

509
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.610
this is a tobacco southern dude,
conservative dude,

510
00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:15.470
no conservative in America,
but you know,
whatever conservative in the world.

511
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.630
And he comes down and says the environment's fucked.

512
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.990
What's interesting is he wins Nobel Prize,
does a good movie,
all this stuff,

513
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.160
but then gets vilified to the point that now Al Gore is a joke.
And when we say,

514
00:29:25.161 --> 00:29:29.210
Oh,
you know,
fuck it.
You know he's this and it's Al Gore.
And,
and by the way,

515
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.320
isn't that a great fucking triumph for four deniers?

516
00:29:33.321 --> 00:29:37.130
Because there's like Al Gore's,
and I would joke for doing a movie that says,
Hey,

517
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:38.600
by the way,
the environment's fucked.

518
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.220
<v 2>Yeah.
Isn't that weird that they can do that,
that they can turn to like,</v>

519
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.030
he's almost like,
remember when Richard Gere Ead,

520
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:49.570
say Richard Gray thought dribble up the ass.
Right?
That's all anybody thought.

521
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.260
Yeah.
Well when you talk about Al Gore now,
especially around certain circles,

522
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:55.210
he's a joke when it comes to the climate,

523
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.500
is there anything that he said that was debunked or was it all bullshit?
No,

524
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:00.270
they just,

525
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.020
<v 4>they kept attacking him,
attacking him,
attacking you.
And by the way,
it's a fat.</v>

526
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:09.050
It's fascinating because what there is is anyone says anything we don't like,

527
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.500
we attack their character and once we attack their character and their on the

528
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:17.760
defensive,
then we fucking won.
Yeah.
Cause then it's not about what they said.

529
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.920
It's about well fucking this person.

530
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:22.380
We can't trust what he said because he liked to finger up his ass.

531
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.890
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

532
00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:29.940
And that is a fascinating thing they do with comments on videos like especially

533
00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:31.850
your kind of documentaries that,

534
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.790
and they attack and it's been proven now.

535
00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:37.680
I mean those are part of the Snowden deal.

536
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.890
We actually got to see fact that they spend money on what propaganda trying to

537
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.810
influence.
They'd go to websites,
message boards,
they go to social chat,

538
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:49.650
they go on Twitter.

539
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.570
There's a lot of people that I've got another question for you.
Okay.

540
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:57.710
<v 4>Why isn't there more fucking outrage about the NSA listening to every fucking</v>

541
00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:01.920
phone call,
every tweet,
every fucking email,
every,
every everything and saying,

542
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:03.630
we live in a goddamn police state.

543
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.210
We signed away where we never even signed it away,
but our,
our,

544
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.360
our rights and freedoms and I look,

545
00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:12.240
I came to this country because it's land of the free home of the brave.

546
00:31:12.241 --> 00:31:16.470
Fuck a beautiful country.
I love it here.
Gorgeous place.
Why is it there?

547
00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:21.471
More outrage at the NSA watching everything we do and doing it a,

548
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.270
<v 2>I think there is outrage,</v>

549
00:31:23.271 --> 00:31:26.990
but I think people feel like they are waiting for something to happen and they

550
00:31:26.991 --> 00:31:28.490
don't know what they can do about it.

551
00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:31.220
They don't feel like they have any real legitimate power.

552
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.110
They can express their outrage.

553
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.040
They wait for the politicians to make some announcements.
And I mean,

554
00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:41.150
what is the only thing that Obama said that they're going to try to slow it down

555
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:45.740
somewhat or do something differently in some,
in some way.
What are you doing?

556
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.910
I'm blocking his face.
Oh fuck all those people.

557
00:31:49.911 --> 00:31:52.610
You can't listen to those people out there.
Those people

558
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.620
<v 4>I didn't know we were on the TV.</v>

559
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.620
<v 2>Yeah.
Don't,
don't worry about all those people.
They complain too much.
They've,</v>

560
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.350
and they love it if you react to them.

561
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.690
I'm a ghost producer.

562
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.020
I like looking at him hiding.
I,
that's why I feel like it's enough for his job

563
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.440
sneaking around behind things and reporting on the reality of the situation.

564
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.850
Um,
where were we?
What were we just talking?

565
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.740
And I say NSA being a horrible,
I'm so scared.

566
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.750
I'm like,
to me are,
they just don't know what to do.

567
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.960
They're in this holding pattern waiting for something to happen.

568
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.810
<v 4>Cause I got to tell you what,
like</v>

569
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.560
that's just bad.
It's going getting worse.
And,
and,
and we,
you know,

570
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:46.770
we just did this interesting story in Camden,
New Jersey.
No,
no,
calm,
right?

571
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.740
No cops,
right?
Yeah.
They run out of money for cops.
So yeah.
So highest crime rate,

572
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.750
highest murder rate ran out of money for cops.
So what did they do?

573
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.670
They hired like a tech company to come in and they put cameras everywhere,

574
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.760
hidden microphones,

575
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.470
and they can try and you like the gunshot sounds and they got cameras everywhere

576
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.470
and they know where everybody is.
So like,
Oh yeah,
we know this guy,

577
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:08.660
we know where he's going and he's probably going to commit a crime,

578
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:10.280
so we're going to pick him up.
It's like,

579
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.380
what's that Tom Cruise movie minority report.
Like they've figured it out like,

580
00:33:14.381 --> 00:33:17.420
well,
everything before it's going to happen.
But,
but I'm like,
hold on.

581
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:21.050
As I'm watching it,
I'm like,
that's not even the scary part.
That's pretty scary.

582
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.640
But they have recorded and filmed everything that's going on in that fucking

583
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:29.120
town 24 hours a day.
They know everything that's going on there.
Right.
And you're,

584
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.230
and it's been such a success.
It really just put it underground,
but whatever.

585
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:36.950
It's been a success because the crime rate drop that Chicago,
New York,

586
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:38.540
all these big cities are doing it now.

587
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.740
So not only are you going to have the NSA listening to your phone calls and

588
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:45.650
you're a fucking,
you know,
whatever your social media,
everything.

589
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:50.680
But you're going to be filmed and listened to everywhere you go.
And if that,

590
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.100
that's not 19 that makes 1984 look like a fucking,
you know,

591
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.670
children's fairy tale,
that's,

592
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:02.900
you're always going to be watched every fucking thing that you ever do.

593
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.230
If that's not the definition of a police state,
I don't know what it is.

594
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.800
<v 2>No.
It's most certainly the definition of a police state.</v>

595
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.910
And it's almost inevitable because of the expanding reach of technology.
Correct.

596
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.930
Once they have the ability to send drones everywhere they want to,

597
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.240
they're going to have drones that are,
the size of bugs,

598
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.370
are going to have HD capability.

599
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.710
<v 4>You're a smart dude because I was just at this tech conference,
uh,
and,</v>

600
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:27.960
and w as all these CEOs in this thing,

601
00:34:27.961 --> 00:34:31.500
and we were talking about it and I would got into a fight with one of these big

602
00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:35.160
dudes.
They're an old dude,
big powerful guy.
And he said,
you know who,
who,

603
00:34:35.161 --> 00:34:38.130
who wouldn't a jail?
Snowden.
And I said,
me,
I wouldn't tell them.

604
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:42.780
What's the difference between Snowden and Woodward and Bernstein,

605
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.550
Woodward and Bernstein and the presidential papers,

606
00:34:44.551 --> 00:34:46.500
like they were the punks of their generation,
like,

607
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.490
but now they're heroes because it's the baby boomers and Snowden's fuck you.

608
00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:53.070
It's what's good for the goose is good for the Gander.
Anyway,

609
00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:57.330
we got into this fight.
What's he,
what's his argument,
you know?
Well,
I didn't,

610
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:02.400
he was just,
he's bad and has whatever the same argument,

611
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.490
no
country

612
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.380
in front of them.
And so,
and so,
you know,
we got into this fight,
but,
but uh,

613
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:17.580
you know,
the interesting thing about that is a,
the fact that a lot of people,

614
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.930
you know,
whistleblowing is seen as unaware.
I,

615
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:25.740
I see it as,
as that's what's going to keep democracy safe,

616
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.440
but this sort of overreaching.
And I said,
look,
you know,

617
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.110
I didn't come to America for it to be,

618
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.530
to live in a police state and this is the definition of a police state is that

619
00:35:34.531 --> 00:35:36.120
they can watch everything that we do.

620
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.230
And it was all these tech guys and the tech guys just sort of rolled their eyes

621
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.420
and said,
it's already happened.
The tech is already there.
The,

622
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.810
the government has already made the deals.
It's a defacto thing.

623
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.420
You can't change it and then,

624
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.740
then I got kind of worried because you're exactly right.
You're 100% right.

625
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.840
The tech is so pervasive that you can't fuck with it.

626
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:58.241
<v 2>Well,</v>

627
00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:02.740
there's also a future tech that they're working on that is essentially tiny wifi

628
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.790
powered cameras that are the size of grains of sand.
Sure.

629
00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.870
And they're going to scatter that.
Yeah,

630
00:36:08.871 --> 00:36:13.480
there is scatter them all throughout cities and they will literally have access

631
00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:17.650
to video,
audio,
everything from these grains of sand.

632
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.690
It'll be all over the beaches.
Tune into them.

633
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.950
<v 4>They,
they like,
if you go to Camden,
it's already happened.</v>

634
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.710
That's the whole scary thing.
It was like,
this isn't like toads have battled,

635
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.940
this isn't science.
It isn't science fiction anymore.
They,
they can hear,

636
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:34.920
they can triangulate sound from any point in the city.
Like inside houses,

637
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.720
like anywhere they can,
they can listen to try anything and you're just like,

638
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:44.520
holy fuck.
Like for those of us who get up to some nefarious activities,

639
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.390
that's not great news.

640
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.580
<v 2>Well,
even not so nefarious activities like people who like the fucking public,</v>

641
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.920
you know,
have you seen that video?

642
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.500
There's a video these to this coupled on Saint Patrick's day.

643
00:36:54.501 --> 00:36:57.100
They were banging behind a dumpster and uh,

644
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.420
these people drove by and got video of it,

645
00:36:59.421 --> 00:37:02.750
put the video online and now the cops are looking for these people.

646
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:08.870
I go,
you good news.
You save us from the bad people that look to fuck.

647
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.160
But that's a problem.

648
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.090
<v 4>Okay,
so now we have information from about everybody at all time.</v>

649
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.780
What are we going to do with that information?
You know,
that some bureaucrat,

650
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.520
major general captain,

651
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.920
some bullshit artists is going to be sitting besides behind some computer things

652
00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:26.520
saying,
you know what?
I think that's bullshit.
I'm going to fucking take that guy.

653
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:28.650
Wait,
that's a police state.
That can't happen.

654
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.130
<v 2>Yeah,
it,
well,
it's kind of unfortunate,</v>

655
00:37:31.131 --> 00:37:33.980
but then then democracy goes out the fucking window.

656
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.190
I think it goes out the window.
Anyway,
I think it's got to shift.

657
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.730
It's going to shift this turning into a depressing,
no,
no,
it's not.

658
00:37:40.731 --> 00:37:41.564
But here's the issue.

659
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.010
Because what's going to happen is the same thing that has sort of happened with

660
00:37:46.011 --> 00:37:48.320
cellulite.
I mean,
obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

661
00:37:48.321 --> 00:37:49.280
Just as a caveat here,

662
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.780
what's going to happen is the same thing that's happening with cellular

663
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:55.670
communication.
At one point in time,

664
00:37:55.671 --> 00:37:59.930
cellular communication was a giant brick that you had to hang on to it.

665
00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:01.610
So you used to have a fucking suitcase,

666
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.230
carry it around with them and hold them in your,

667
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.960
and now you can go to the Amazon and people have cell phones.

668
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.160
You can go to the poor third world countries and people have south.
Correct.

669
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.200
I think that right now the information,
the access to all this stuff,

670
00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:19.250
the ability to know what's going on everywhere all the time is terrifying to us

671
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:20.660
because we don't possess it.

672
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.840
The only people that possess it or the people like the NSA or the people that

673
00:38:23.841 --> 00:38:24.830
are monitoring Camden,

674
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:30.050
eventually that technology will become so pervasive.
It will be like Wikipedia.

675
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.190
It'll be like everything else.

676
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.070
It'll be all the time and you will have no privacy,
but they will have

677
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.780
<v 5>no privacy either.
You know we going to have privacy.</v>

678
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.540
The one I don't believe that.

679
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:43.960
I believe the rich will have privacy because there'll be able to pay for tech

680
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.640
that can protect them.

681
00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.190
<v 1>They'll try new shit will come up.
You know,</v>

682
00:38:49.191 --> 00:38:50.480
you're going to know you're going to have a phone,

683
00:38:50.481 --> 00:38:52.880
they're gonna know where your phone is going to have an internet connection.

684
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.310
Blocking technologies might take it to another place.

685
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:59.060
I just think it's going to get even crazier than that cause I think that when I

686
00:38:59.061 --> 00:39:02.600
extrapolate,
when I get,
when I get really high,
and I think about this,

687
00:39:02.601 --> 00:39:03.950
especially when I get into the tank,

688
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:08.420
I come in to this one conclusion and this one conclusion is that money and its

689
00:39:08.421 --> 00:39:11.160
current form is not resource base.

690
00:39:11.161 --> 00:39:14.750
The economy is essentially based on confidence and numbers.

691
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.090
Well that's just information and in a certain point in time technology is going

692
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:24.080
to hit that it's going to hit a bottleneck and that bottleneck is going to be

693
00:39:24.081 --> 00:39:24.914
money.

694
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.090
The bottleneck is that technology as it progresses,

695
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:34.870
the trend seems to be in a more immediate access to information and a easier

696
00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:36.650
connection between people.

697
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.250
Well that's going to come to a point where there's one thing that's shielded one

698
00:39:40.251 --> 00:39:42.770
piece of information that shield,
and that's going to be money.

699
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.510
We're not going to know.
What are your thoughts on Bitcoin?
Well,
the,

700
00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:50.570
I think that's a part of it.
I think that's just one part of it.
You know,

701
00:39:50.571 --> 00:39:55.460
I think bitcoin is being for sure tampered with for sure.
Fucked with.

702
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.020
I think all these people,

703
00:39:57.021 --> 00:40:01.550
like this guy that had the Mt Gox and fucking $300 million goes away and it's

704
00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:05.870
crashed.
That is most likely a bunch of things,
I'm sure.

705
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.220
And competence.
I'm sure.
Shitty programming probably sabotage.

706
00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:11.670
Let's be honest on these.

707
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.320
Really thought that it's possible for a new currency to come along.

708
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.820
Antonopoulos coming back on again.
Yeah.
He's coming back on soon in April.
Um,

709
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:24.530
w without a doubt someone would step in and try to do that.

710
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.940
Why would they not try to do that?

711
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.360
What they're going to just sit by and twiddle their thumbs and hope that their

712
00:40:29.361 --> 00:40:32.900
money's good enough to compete.
Get the fuck Outta here.
These are criminals.

713
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.020
These are fucking swashbucklers and Buccaneers.
They're assholes.

714
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:41.180
They're digital Buccaneers and just like the same people send people out to

715
00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:44.360
diminish climate reports by leaving shitty comments,

716
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.360
they're going to also go after bitcoin any way they can.

717
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.260
<v 5>Did you hear about this Silk Road Shit that her,
yes,
yes.</v>

718
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.060
Yeah.
Anything on that?
We're doing a film on the till you tell people folks,

719
00:40:56.061 --> 00:41:00.050
you don't know what Silk Road is.
Tell them what it is and what happened.
Well,

720
00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:03.020
I'm not the biggest expert in the world.
We're doing a film on it and uh,
and,

721
00:41:03.021 --> 00:41:07.410
and so I only know the sort of pitch versions.
What's a website?
It's,
it's,
it's a,

722
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.410
yeah,
it's a website.
It's a,
it's a,

723
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.840
it was a service that was the dark web.
The,
you know,

724
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.260
a lot of shit went down.

725
00:41:15.261 --> 00:41:20.000
And basically where they made their money was it was a door to door drug dealing

726
00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:23.870
service where they made the majority of their cash and it was high quality.

727
00:41:23.871 --> 00:41:26.840
They guaranteed the quality and,
and you could,

728
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.790
you didn't have to leave your house and someone would come and they would take

729
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:34.460
us sort of charge on both sides,
like deliver coke.
And to your house.
Correct.

730
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.420
Anything?
Anything.
It was like dark web,
sort of a Craig's list.

731
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.250
Well,
this is where it gets interesting is the guy who started,
he started,

732
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:46.970
it was like 21 years old.
He said like this nice kid,
whatever.

733
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.500
Apparently in really nice kid and they,
they,
they talked to his parents and shit.

734
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:51.711
They're like,

735
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:56.711
well now he's living in the North Pole with your fucking reporters hiding under

736
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:01.370
a Naglu.
Now he's now he's 20 stories down and he's dead.

737
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:04.580
And the CIA building.
No,
they got him.
They got him.
You out.
Here's the story.

738
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.260
This is my favorite part is this young kid,
right?
He sets up Silk Road,

739
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:12.620
which is basically a sort of peer to peer,

740
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.850
whatever the fuck you want to have happen on the,
on the,
on the second economy,

741
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.940
a lot of drugs but basically drugs.
But yes,
there was arms.

742
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.590
Anything sort of illegal was going on,
was going through this thing.

743
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.110
Now what happened was,
you know,
very sin,
a sin,

744
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.030
a graphics cinemagraphic moment.
He's in a public library,
right?

745
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.740
Using the public Wifi.

746
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.070
He's running the whole thing from his laptop and they know if he,

747
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.720
if he closes the laptop it will be encrypted and then it's a brick and he's

748
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:48.860
fucked.
So the whole,
everyone in the library,
the person looking at the books,

749
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:50.930
the library and the,
you know,

750
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:54.500
the freaky dude sleeping in the court and they're all fucking FPI right.

751
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.010
And they're all watching this kid.
He's like,
you know,

752
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.290
really young guy as he's running this silk road thing.

753
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.980
And they had to get him before he closed his laptop.

754
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:07.430
So he literally stood up to like grab something and they just,

755
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.340
the whole library went into motion and they got them.

756
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.720
Now what they found out was he was just a guy trying to run a business.

757
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:17.570
He's like,
okay,
you know,
you bring the drugs here and you bring the drugs there.

758
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.890
And if people,

759
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.100
people started fucking with the business much like bitcoin and shit,

760
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:23.790
they just started trying to fuck with it.
And you know,

761
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.390
by the way you deal with a lot of criminals are going to do some criminal shit.

762
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.370
They're going to try to put it over on you.
Now,

763
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:31.910
one of the things that Silk Road did was it was like a craigslist for like

764
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:35.900
hitman and shit,
so he was like,
okay,
you're on my,
my Silk Road.

765
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.140
I'm going to,
you know,

766
00:43:38.141 --> 00:43:42.170
this guy's bad for soak roadies dealing shitty heroin or he's being bad or he's

767
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:44.330
saying some shit,
so he just would have them killed,

768
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.110
allegedly allegedly would have them kill because he was trying to maintain the

769
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:51.740
sort of quality of his product.
So there was assassinations,

770
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:53.990
hit man arms dealing,

771
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:57.110
drug dealing all on this sort of dark web shit that was going on.

772
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:01.840
Then they caught the earthquake,
an earthquake,

773
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.700
what are you doing?
Is that like an effect?
I was going to switch cameras,

774
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:07.370
but then it was,
oh just,
I'm like,
what the fuck is this an effect?

775
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:08.400
This is a new artistic,

776
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:13.610
but what I find interesting about this is it's just an example of this whole

777
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:16.640
second economy,
the gray economy,
the black economy,

778
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:21.641
black market that some people have estimated is up to a quarter to a half of

779
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:22.820
what the global economy is.

780
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:25.520
Because if you put in all the drugs that are dealt in the world,

781
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.190
all the arms that are dealt in the world,
right?

782
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.870
All the secondary quote Unquote Gurus,
gray electronics,
the seconds,
the,
the,
the,

783
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.450
the,
the,
the stolen IP coming out of China,

784
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.030
all of that stuff.
Because if you go to India,

785
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.080
everything is at 20 $20 pirated smartphone,
right?

786
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.790
Like hundreds of millions of these fucking things.
I mean,

787
00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:50.930
so all of this gray economies being run somehow and there's bitcoin and there's

788
00:44:50.931 --> 00:44:53.670
Silk Road and there's all these different crazy fucking things that are out

789
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:56.880
there running this shit.
And that's why I was,
I was talking,
I agree with you.

790
00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:00.960
I agree with what you're saying because all money is now,
it's just data.

791
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.130
It's just,
it's,
it's,
it's,

792
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.520
this bank has this many credits and that bank has that and we swapped them up.

793
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.320
It's not based on the gold standard.
It's not based on anything.
And so,
you know,

794
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.710
bitcoin or virtual currencies are interesting,
but you know,

795
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:17.550
they can be hacked as,
as,
as,
as we just saw in Japan.

796
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.740
But also,
you know,
what can you,
what can you actually buy and sell with them?

797
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.030
Because what they're doing is they're actually using the old drug dealers or

798
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:31.980
slash terrorists,
um,
system,
which is,
okay,

799
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:36.981
I've got some corn in Tunisia and you've got some flax in Pakistan.

800
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.210
And those would just be wiped out in somebody.

801
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:45.390
Then in Afghanistan we'll get a case of a AK 47,

802
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.420
and that's what bitcoin and that's what Silk Road.

803
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:50.250
And that's what a lot of these things ended up doing.

804
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.950
<v 3>AndW didn't one guy wind up going to jail because he gave bitcoins or he,</v>

805
00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:58.810
he,

806
00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:03.810
he sold bitcoins to someone who wound up using those bitcoins to buy drugs.

807
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.110
We'll see.
This is the deal.
And that,

808
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:09.820
that's a very good point because they didn't even buy the drugs because after it

809
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:14.820
<v 5>nine 11,
what happened was the government said,</v>

810
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.150
by the way,
they pretty much know everything's going.

811
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:22.830
So they went into mutual funds.
They went into Switzerland,
they,

812
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.050
I have a house in Costa Rica and there was this development fund and Costa Rica

813
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:27.630
was,
uh,
you know,

814
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.860
a lot of foreigners go down there and retire there and they were investing in

815
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.420
the,
in the,
in the,
in the country.

816
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:38.670
But because one guy in the fund had ties to a drug cartel,
everybody,

817
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.280
they just took all the money.
It was like two and a half billion dollars.

818
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.340
<v 3>Just took the drug laundering fund.
So we're going to take all the mice,</v>

819
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:49.130
all these gringos,
lost all their retirement funds.
And by the way,

820
00:46:49.131 --> 00:46:52.580
what's interesting about who took that money?
The American government.
Sure.

821
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.990
After nine 11 and by they way,

822
00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:57.770
they took trillions of dollars doing this off the bat.
It's not on the books,

823
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.660
it's not on the books because they just took it in and wow,
there you go.

824
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.720
They're allowed to do with it.
Whatever they want to do.
Right.
After nine,

825
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.070
they went around everywhere

826
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.770
<v 5>and they use the world sympathy to say,
okay,
now we're going to,</v>

827
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.310
now we're going to take this money.
We know it's drug laundering.

828
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.630
We know this is this,
we know this is this,
we know this is this,

829
00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.070
we're going to take it all.
And they just took it off.

830
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.180
<v 3>Wow.
And they,
how hilarious is that?
They use terrorism.</v>

831
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:26.210
They were used mass murder as a pretense of stealing drug dealers money and

832
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:29.950
everybody else is around.
Like if I invested in this thing

833
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.700
<v 5>and then some dude I never even met in message one time dealt drugs,</v>

834
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.220
then they take get to take my money to,
do you know what,

835
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:37.640
that there's a quote about

836
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.210
<v 2>capitalizing on,
uh,
any sort of a,</v>

837
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.210
a moment that it's negative moment.
Well,
any,

838
00:47:44.211 --> 00:47:46.780
any negative moment that it becomes even more negative,
you know,

839
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.270
capitalize on it.
But that's the idea behind a,
almost every government,

840
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.710
they don't look at negative moments and any sort of a mass casualty event,

841
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.050
they don't look at it as just a tragedy.

842
00:47:57.051 --> 00:47:59.900
They also look at it as an opportunity to,

843
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.080
we use that tragedy to further whatever ideas they have.

844
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.630
Real politic zero sum game politics.

845
00:48:05.631 --> 00:48:08.250
There is a winner and there is a loser and I'm going to be the winner.

846
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:14.170
I think what we're dealing with right now is the adolescence of the emergence of

847
00:48:14.301 --> 00:48:17.660
instant technology,
the emergence of Internet information.

848
00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:21.770
And right now it's only a few people that have their greasy pause on this kind

849
00:48:21.771 --> 00:48:25.040
of shit.
And when Edward Snowden comes out with all this data,

850
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.880
when Wiki leaks comes out with all this data,
and then everybody's like,
wait,

851
00:48:28.881 --> 00:48:32.840
what?
This is what I've been calling this generation.
The wait what generation?

852
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.090
Because I feel like that's what's going on.

853
00:48:35.091 --> 00:48:37.850
I feel like a lot of us are in the middle of going,
wait,
wait,
what?

854
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.560
<v 5>What?
I like,
what I like about it is that it's proof.
You sit there and you say,</v>

855
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.360
oh,
it's not true.
Here it is.
Here's the NSA,
here's the FBI,

856
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.870
here's the CIA.
These are the files.
This is what it says.

857
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.060
<v 2>Here's the proof.
Yeah.
The,
and it is,
I mean,</v>

858
00:48:54.061 --> 00:48:56.640
people used to call Alex Jones a fucking complete crazy person.

859
00:48:56.641 --> 00:49:01.320
And it's weird when a ranting lunatic is right 90% of the time.

860
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.540
That's scary,
you know?
I mean,
that's when it gets scary.

861
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.400
He's right about so much shit.

862
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.600
So much of what he called in the nineties by the way,
when I met him,

863
00:49:09.601 --> 00:49:12.930
I met him in [inaudible] 98 and he was calling all this shit.

864
00:49:12.931 --> 00:49:16.610
He was saying they are going to be monitoring your emails.
I'm like,
fuck you,

865
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.590
my email.
You know where I'm going to go to do comedy wanting to get 100% true.

866
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.790
Yeah.
I mean,

867
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.250
what we're dealing with right now is a few people that have this power,

868
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.480
and I think it's going to come down to a point in time where as this technology

869
00:49:30.481 --> 00:49:34.080
increases,
if you just looked at it,
don't look at it in the context of culture.

870
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.640
Don't look in the context of what we're accustomed to as far as our expectations

871
00:49:38.641 --> 00:49:41.410
and privacy,
but instead look at it as it is.

872
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.580
It's a wave that's moving in a certain direction.
Well,
where's it going?

873
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.390
What's it?
What's it doing?
It's moving in the direction.
What's the direction?

874
00:49:48.391 --> 00:49:52.380
Well,
the direction is information being passed freely.
What's money information?

875
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.430
What's going to happen?

876
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:56.390
It's going to hit a roadblock and the roadblock is people want to keep a hold

877
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.780
their money.
They want to control the money,

878
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.090
there's going to be no control of the money.
The whole thing is about access.

879
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.370
The whole thing is about access to this information.

880
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:10.580
And as this whole thing grows and expands and becomes more powerful and more

881
00:50:10.681 --> 00:50:14.190
prevalent and more pervasive,
it's gonna reach a bottleneck.

882
00:50:14.191 --> 00:50:16.530
And I think that bottleneck is money.
I really do.

883
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:17.950
<v 5>Well,
I've got another question.</v>

884
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.780
Re Money [inaudible] 2008,
right?

885
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:25.240
Recession.
What,
what,

886
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:30.410
what sparks out of that is riots in Europe,
Arab spring,

887
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:35.090
all across the Middle East,
riots and Southeast Asia,
riots in South America,

888
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:39.920
rights around the world by Gen y because they completely disenfranchised.

889
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:42.320
No future.
You take someone's future away,
what they're gonna do,

890
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:43.910
they're gonna smash it up.
Why wouldn't they?

891
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.150
That's what revolution has been historically.
Okay.

892
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.100
So now,
you know,
China's fucked.

893
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.470
They're slowing down and they're in real trouble.

894
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:59.590
India's rupee is collapsing.
Uh,
you know,
we're,
we're,

895
00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.830
we're,
it's,
it's,
it's not a question of if,
it's a question of when,

896
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.760
what happens when you have another economic downturn and the people who have

897
00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:15.020
been sort of treading water and just are starting to see some like go down
again.

898
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.590
What happens then on an economic level when you have these young people who have

899
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.710
been fucked for the past eight years,
say,
okay,
fuck,

900
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:26.360
I'm going to have to tighten my belt for another eight.

901
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.740
<v 2>I don't know what the economy is.
I don't understand it.
You know,</v>

902
00:51:31.741 --> 00:51:32.071
when,

903
00:51:32.071 --> 00:51:37.071
when you talk about one house being worth $5 million in one house be worth in

904
00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:38.161
Detroit,

905
00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:43.161
$500 and this is a valuable place to live and this is,

906
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:48.670
and this guy gets paid $100,000 for the same job that this woman gets paid

907
00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:50.520
$30,000 for.

908
00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:53.740
And they both worked the same amount of hours and a certain point in time was

909
00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:58.170
like,
what is our economy?
It's a construct.
Well,
what,
what are we selling?

910
00:51:58.171 --> 00:52:02.490
What are we buying and where?
Where's it all coming from?
Who you made it up,

911
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.320
right?
But here's the question.
If it worked in 2006,

912
00:52:07.321 --> 00:52:08.790
okay,
if two in 2006,

913
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:13.380
if everything was rosy and people are buying houses and everything was great,

914
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.640
you'd buy a house,
he'd sell it a year lady and make 50 grand.
What,
what is that?

915
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.500
What?
What's different now?
What's different now?
Someone will,
you know,

916
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:25.080
you talked to people that are economic experts and they give you some sort of an

917
00:52:25.081 --> 00:52:29.370
explanation of how people extracted money from the system.
How the banks,

918
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:34.640
we banked on the fact that the loans they were giving and then somehow than they

919
00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:38.160
made money.
Well,
what does that mean?
What does it mean?

920
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.060
Like we're the same people are working,
there's a same amount of stuff.

921
00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:45.480
There's the same amount of cars cause the same amount of buildings,

922
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.770
there's the same,
roughly the same amount of furniture.
What the fuck is going on?

923
00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:52.440
Then all of a sudden everything's terrible and no one could get a job.

924
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.930
<v 5>I love obviously be very simple.
I got it.
Yeah.</v>

925
00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:01.630
What I love about it is,
uh,
recently,
uh,
somebody came up as very,

926
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.080
it's a very good idea by the way,
to try to explain economic disparity.

927
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.990
And there was a time when the aristocrats who were,
you know,

928
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.990
been knighted by God and they owned everything and everybody else worked for

929
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:17.690
them.
That's how it worked.
They,
the,
they could fuck the,

930
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.030
the first port daughters before they got married,

931
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.330
they could do whatever they want.
They were the law.
They collected the taxes.

932
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.070
It was a mafia system.
It was,
we collect the tax

933
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.570
<v 3>here and pay up to the king over there.</v>

934
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:31.860
What's interesting is they just did a thing on,
uh,

935
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.040
there's more economic disparity today.

936
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.730
Then during the Downton Abbey era of the aristocracy owned everything and

937
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:45.120
everybody else was like,
you know,
screwed.
Which is when the,
the,
you know,

938
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:49.200
Sylvia Revolution started and the big socialist wave around the world because

939
00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:53.160
the aristocrats own everything and there's more economic disparity today than

940
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:53.994
there was then.

941
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.870
Is it because the people that like the people that know how to fuck with money,

942
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:01.560
the 1% yes.
Just have accumulated insane,

943
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:06.510
impossible to imagine.
Well,
the aristocrats were given their God given,

944
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:06.751
right?

945
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:10.410
We own the land because at the time it was horizontal production is I have to

946
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:11.820
make more carrots,
you know?

947
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.120
And so the only way of getting more carrots was to have more land.

948
00:54:15.121 --> 00:54:16.110
So I took over your land.

949
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.350
That's why there was constant warfare and then it went to vertical production,

950
00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:20.460
which is technology.

951
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.610
So now whoever owns the sort of technological means can sort of,
you know,

952
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.790
write their own ticket.
So you're exactly right.

953
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:31.590
So the 1% now know how to game the system,
you know better than,

954
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.070
than,
than,
than most.
To put it into perspective,

955
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.800
what were we were talking about earlier when I was saying that I don't

956
00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:40.530
understand the economy.
I mean I understand competition.

957
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:42.480
I understand if one person is better at their job,

958
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:45.000
they should make more than another person who's better at their job.

959
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:50.100
But when you look at big money,
crazy money,

960
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:54.060
where's it coming from?
A lot of times,
who is,
whose,
whose capitalizing on it?

961
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.950
The people that work with big money bankers.
Like,
what are they doing exactly?

962
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:02.670
They're not digging holes that mean what the fuck are they doing where they have

963
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:06.870
$1 trillion or whatever the fuck.
Uh,
you know,
a Lehman Brothers guy has,

964
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.100
has one of those giant hundred acre estates on the Hamptons.

965
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.100
Where are they and what do they,
where are they make their money?

966
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:15.720
And this is very,
it's just a,
again,

967
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:18.180
I'm going to put it into gambling terms cause I'm a gambler.

968
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.040
If you could go to Vegas,
right?
And you could say,
okay,

969
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:27.000
I'm going to bet $1 billion or $1 trillion,
but let's say a billion,

970
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:31.740
let's say $1 million.
So we got on,
I got to put $1 million on black.
Well,
I lost.

971
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.830
Okay,
I'm going to write that off.
So I didn't really,

972
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.930
there's not going to put $1 billion on black.
I lost again.
Okay,

973
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.820
I'm going to write that off.
I put a billion,
uh Oh,
I won.

974
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.890
I get to keep that money.
Yeah,
I play that every day.

975
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:48.390
I would play that game every fucking day of the Goddamn we.
But guess what?

976
00:55:48.391 --> 00:55:50.250
They don't,
or you do that game in Vegas,

977
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.610
but they let you do that game on Wall Street.
It's unbelievable.

978
00:55:53.611 --> 00:55:57.690
It's so hard to wrap your head around when you really try to think about the

979
00:55:57.691 --> 00:56:02.140
amount of money being exchanged.
And then the fast mind boggling,
it's fine.

980
00:56:02.141 --> 00:56:06.150
But the fact that this argument was thrown about that they're too big to fail

981
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:10.660
and then,
you know,
the government comes in and bails them out and set taxpayers,

982
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.460
government,

983
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.070
the government doesn't have any money and they steal it from the tax payer

984
00:56:14.071 --> 00:56:17.590
government gets its money from taxpayers.
And that's what,
you know,

985
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.330
I just did this thing,
uh,
on,
on,
on,
on Afghanistan.

986
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:23.980
But that's the tip of the iceberg is how much money

987
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.470
<v 5>the government throws away.
And by the way,
I pay a ship of fucking tax.</v>

988
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.080
So when I see that,
I'm like,
oh,
Whoa,

989
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.460
my tax just went down the fucking toilet.
Runaway.
In what way?
What do you mean?

990
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:38.470
Well,
so for example,

991
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:43.490
the piece I did in Afghanistan is we've spent $100 billion,
uh,

992
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.260
and reconstruction there.
And the majority of it,
if not all of it,

993
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:49.510
has just been flushed down the toilet.
For example,

994
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:53.440
$1 billion were spent on helicopters that don't fly,
you know,

995
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:57.750
billions of dollars are spent on,
on,
on,
on,
on,
um,

996
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.900
uh,
uh,
culvert denial system.
It's a long story,

997
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:05.110
but basically to try to stop by eds from being put into cover,

998
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.860
they were never built.
We're paying money directly into the Taliban sans.

999
00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:13.690
We build a power plants that are never used because they're inefficient and too

1000
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:16.180
expensive because they use diesel and diesel can't,

1001
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:20.290
you can't power power plants with diesel.
And by the way,
guests who collects the,

1002
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:25.150
uh,
the fees are the Taliban because of the places where we go into collect,

1003
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:27.220
the fees were too dangerous to actually go into.

1004
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.000
So we're just throwing hundreds of billions of dollars down the toilet.

1005
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:35.950
That's just Afghanistan.
Not to mention the rack,
not to mention by the way,
dod,

1006
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:39.220
not to mention here in America,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
So you sit there and you say,

1007
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:43.220
we're paying all this money in,
tax taxes are going up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.
And,

1008
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:46.630
and where the fuck is the money going?
The money's going into the fucking toilet.

1009
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:50.050
Many cases.
And you sit there and you say,
that's not fucking good,
man.

1010
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.000
That's not good.
It's,

1011
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.750
it's a sort of a symptom of what happens when money's there.

1012
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.780
When mine is there and it's legal to extract it,

1013
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.930
all of a sudden a bunch of people start going,
wow.
I think,

1014
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.410
I think unless we question it's our money.

1015
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:10.300
So this is the whole basis of democracy.
It's our government and it's our money.

1016
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:16.350
And what's happening now is the government is acting with impunity with no,

1017
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:19.480
and like you said,
I'm like,
what about climate change?
What about war?

1018
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:22.030
What about all the shit?
And you're like,
well,
people feel disenfranchised.

1019
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:24.100
They can't do anything about it.
Hey B,

1020
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:28.710
it's their money that people are spending and,
and,

1021
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:32.290
and,
and we're going,
well,
fuck,
they shouldn't be spending 70,
$80,000 hammers.

1022
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.700
That's not fucking cool.
Well,
the basis of democracies,
you don't do that.

1023
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.750
The basis of democracy,
you can't do that.
But what's happening now,

1024
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:45.880
and this is what I find it another problem in our modern age is,
okay,

1025
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:49.880
this is a fucking huge problem yet we can we,

1026
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.760
we feel we can't do anything about it.
And,

1027
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:55.360
and I've said this before and now I'm into my drink.

1028
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:59.170
So I'm going to say it again,
is that's why these podcasts are important.

1029
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.520
That's why media is important.
That's why journalism is important.
Look,

1030
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.910
you started out in a different way.
You came at this from a different way.

1031
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:08.260
I came at this from a different way.

1032
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:12.400
The reason why we're doing this now is because we're frustrated and we're
saying,

1033
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:16.420
look,
I don't want to talk about,
you know,
shoes fucking every day of the week.

1034
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.950
You don't want to just do stand up or,
or,
or your MMA ship,
both of which are,

1035
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.450
but you want to do something only fuck dudes,

1036
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.420
I'm gonna fucking talk about shit because this shit is important.

1037
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.140
The reason why we have to do that is because we can't be complacent.

1038
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.030
We can't just sit there and say,
you know what?

1039
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.630
Fuck is too much money or there's too much because they are taking money to do

1040
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:36.464
bad things with it.

1041
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:40.940
They are taking our fucking freedoms and and and spying on us with the NSA and

1042
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:44.240
it's guys like you and guys like me and guys like by the way everybody out there

1043
00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:48.140
in the fucking death squad and rap band and all these mother fuckers and we have

1044
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:51.440
to be the ones to get out there on a grassroots moon and say fuck you,

1045
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.570
stop fucking tapping my phone.

1046
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:57.350
Stop taking my money to fucking throw down into the Taliban tans and Afghanistan

1047
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.290
stopped this shit because unless we do then there's going to be no more

1048
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.290
democracy in America.

1049
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:05.200
<v 1>I think you're certainly right in some ways and I think also what's going on is</v>

1050
01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.000
this idea of us versus them.

1051
01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:10.630
It's completely ridiculous and I think people that are in positions of power are

1052
01:00:10.631 --> 01:00:13.650
going to be forced to realize this.
You are us.
Yeah.

1053
01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:18.010
All of you people that are congressmen,
all you people that are senators,

1054
01:00:18.011 --> 01:00:21.790
all you people that are mayors,
all you people that are cops,
you are us.

1055
01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.160
There is no us and them.
Correct.

1056
01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.280
Especially when you're dealing with those sort of positions,

1057
01:00:27.281 --> 01:00:29.160
the positions of political power,

1058
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:32.290
positions of authority that you are us.

1059
01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:35.020
You're not even profiting off of this.
You,

1060
01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:39.310
if you want to put yourself into a position where you sell your soul to profit

1061
01:00:39.311 --> 01:00:42.010
off it,
then you're not us.
But for right now,

1062
01:00:42.011 --> 01:00:46.360
anybody jockeying into any,
any sort of a political position,

1063
01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.810
understand that it doesn't have to be this way.

1064
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.450
Understand that you are us and there you are.

1065
01:00:52.451 --> 01:00:57.451
People who have wives and children and families and jobs and dogs.

1066
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.620
We're all human.
We're all human.

1067
01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:04.710
And I believe that we can somehow or another construct an economy that's based

1068
01:01:04.811 --> 01:01:07.090
on ethics and morals.
I really do.

1069
01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.510
I don't think there's anything that says that everybody has to be greedy.

1070
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.930
I don't think there's anything that says that people have to capitalize and

1071
01:01:13.931 --> 01:01:17.110
every single fucking loophole and fuck everybody over along the way.

1072
01:01:17.111 --> 01:01:20.410
And I think one of the reasons why they've been away are allowed to do this or

1073
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:25.770
able to do this for so long is because of the lack of access to information.

1074
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.250
I think they were able to secret secretly hide so much shitty,

1075
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:33.910
wrong doing in the past and that it became policy.

1076
01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.780
It became habit.
It became what you were taught when you were young,

1077
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:40.120
when you joined a company,
Hey,
this is how we do it and you know,

1078
01:01:40.121 --> 01:01:43.180
you want to fucking play golf with us and drive a Ferrari.
All right,
I'm in.

1079
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:44.111
And next thing you know,

1080
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:47.830
you're compromise just sort of like Leonardo Dicaprio's character was

1081
01:01:47.831 --> 01:01:49.360
compromised and the wolf of Wall Street,

1082
01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:51.640
I don't know if that's how it actually happened in real life,

1083
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:57.410
but he started in with good ideas and it was invested into a completely corrupt

1084
01:01:57.821 --> 01:02:01.990
system and then became a part of it and became a part of the corruption that is

1085
01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.610
essentially most likely what happens in every form of government.

1086
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.631
Essentially.

1087
01:02:07.631 --> 01:02:12.400
There's good people that eventually join this thing and then realize,
oh,

1088
01:02:12.401 --> 01:02:15.550
this is a completely compromised movement.
There's no way to fix it.

1089
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.830
I'll just be one of those guys.
And they'll drink every night and I take Xanax.

1090
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.370
I think it's going to have system.
I think it has to you.
I agree.

1091
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:27.120
But I also think it's going to stop because you're not going to be able to just

1092
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:30.630
write it off.
It's dark.
It's going to be everyone.

1093
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.810
The same reason why you can spy on people in Camden,
New Jersey,

1094
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:36.560
that is the echo of a,

1095
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:41.580
a future event that's going to happen that's going to remove all privacy and it

1096
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:42.744
is inevitable,

1097
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.740
<v 5>but I'm going to say on a personal level,
you've done well.</v>

1098
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.060
I've done well.

1099
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.560
We're two guys sorta sitting at the the nice end of the spectrum saying,
hey,

1100
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.210
it's got to fucking change.

1101
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.510
If you and I are saying it's got to change and we're at the winning end of the

1102
01:02:57.511 --> 01:03:00.810
fucking scratch and win,
then guess what?
Shit is fucked up.

1103
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:05.330
<v 1>Well,
there's no,
I agree that you and I have,
we're both comfortable.</v>

1104
01:03:05.331 --> 01:03:08.330
We don't have to worry about feeding ourselves or housing our families,

1105
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:11.910
but what happens at a certain point in time when you,

1106
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:14.630
you make enough money that you don't have to worry about your bills,

1107
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:19.710
you at least I start contemplating what is important.
Correct.

1108
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:24.530
Important.
Right?
What's important,
this is so corny,
but what's important is love.

1109
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:28.550
What's important is friendship.
What's important is,
you know,

1110
01:03:28.551 --> 01:03:32.570
it's nice to walk down the street and say hi to your neighbor.

1111
01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:33.770
If your neighbor is happy,

1112
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.700
if your neighbor is being held at fucking point and a dragging them in the
house,

1113
01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.310
it's not so fun to say hi to your neighbor.
Oh,
hi neighbor,

1114
01:03:40.311 --> 01:03:45.170
you have a gun to your head.
Oh,
sorry.
What did you do wrong?
Yeah,
I'm over here.

1115
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:47.450
You know?
Sorry,
I'm having a great time to go watch TV.

1116
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.760
I didn't do anything wrong.
The gamestops beyond.

1117
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.340
It's only fun if everybody's having fun.
That's what community's all about.

1118
01:03:55.341 --> 01:04:00.320
It's one of the reasons why human beings evolved into the point where we're at

1119
01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:04.510
right now to the point where we have cities and in cultures,
and I mean we,

1120
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.400
we had to make it at least safe enough that everybody could with it

1121
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.630
<v 5>grew up in a village mentality.</v>

1122
01:04:09.631 --> 01:04:12.120
We all grew up in villages and everybody hung out together,

1123
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:14.490
went to the pub together and did all this to shit together.

1124
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.800
That's how we operate at our best.
Exactly.

1125
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:20.550
And then we sort of separated into this sort of suburban thing,

1126
01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:24.300
but now it's like you're exactly right.
It's this community,

1127
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.470
we're part of this community.

1128
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.410
What I find interesting and every time I do this podcast,

1129
01:04:28.411 --> 01:04:32.940
I am always blown away by it is there's so many people out there that think

1130
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:37.290
exactly the same way and we all sort of believe the same things and think the

1131
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:40.980
same things and we're all interested in the same things or pissed off about the

1132
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:42.360
same things yet.

1133
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.440
Like that's millions and millions of literally millions of fucking people.

1134
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.240
And yet it's,

1135
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.220
there's this sort of frustration as to what the fuck you do with that.
Yes.

1136
01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.130
<v 1>What does,</v>

1137
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:57.840
there's never been anything to do before you had to wait for representatives to

1138
01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:00.720
do you justice.
You had to vote for people that were going to disappoint you.

1139
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:05.670
You had to get yourself to the polls and hope that all your bitching and moaning

1140
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:07.230
at work and all year,
you know,

1141
01:05:07.231 --> 01:05:10.500
reading the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times somehow in her,

1142
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.600
that made a difference.
And most of the time it didn't.

1143
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.060
It didn't because there was,
there was walls,
there was wall.

1144
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.970
What's the wall though?
Not there anymore.
The walls,

1145
01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:22.270
the distribution of information.
Same thing we're talking about with money.

1146
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:26.650
Podcast is essentially just a distribution of information device that's never

1147
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:27.670
been available before.

1148
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:32.671
Vice is a distribution of information device that's never been available before.

1149
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:36.760
There was never some crazy Fox from Canada that we're going to the Congo looking

1150
01:05:36.761 --> 01:05:41.410
for dinosaurs and talking to cannibals and Liberia.
That shit never happened,

1151
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:41.990
man.

1152
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:46.760
The most radical shit you had was John Stossel asking a pro wrestler whether or

1153
01:05:46.761 --> 01:05:50.800
not I was really getting smacked in the head.
Oh my God.
He hit him in the head.

1154
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.180
That was like radical journalism.
Uh,
you know,
on television,

1155
01:05:55.181 --> 01:05:59.230
on mainstream television just a few decades ago.
I mean,
there,

1156
01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:03.810
that was a hard hitting journalist.
You know,
there,
there wasn't anybody,
you know,

1157
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:08.350
we're going to go to Waco and watch from the background as the government takes

1158
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:12.820
Sherman tanks and rolls over houses.
But what's really going on there with the,

1159
01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:13.810
no one's going in.

1160
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:17.230
No one's fucking playing guitar with David Koresh and finding out what the fuck

1161
01:06:17.231 --> 01:06:19.300
is actually happening.
You guys would,

1162
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:22.810
David Choe would be sitting right next to David Koresh is the burnt that fucking

1163
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:26.170
building down.
You know,
he'd be wearing as best as underwear,

1164
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.020
jumping off the fucking roof with a camera,
you know,

1165
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:32.020
running to you and you would upload it online.
True,
true,
true.

1166
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.310
It's a different world.

1167
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:37.750
Is this guy like you is not supposed to be in the position that you're in?

1168
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:40.450
You're right.
It's true.
A guy like me,

1169
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:44.470
it's not supposed to be in a position I'm in.
Correct.
I'm easily marginalized.

1170
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:47.680
I marginalize myself at every point in time I can.

1171
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.730
I want everybody to know that I'm a,
I'm a fucking Schmoe.
The falls,

1172
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:56.731
you have a huge grassroots uprising at your back,

1173
01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.690
<v 4>pushing you is fucking amazing.</v>

1174
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.750
<v 1>Which is why I love coming here.
Well,
they just know that I'm a lightening Rod.</v>

1175
01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:06.180
That's all it is.
It's a,
I'm a,
I'm exactly

1176
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.180
<v 4>like you have to give a shit.
You don't give a shit to say what you want to say.</v>

1177
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:11.223
You don't give a shit

1178
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:16.020
<v 1>the head.
Too many times do the sun wrong with me.
I've got issues for sure.</v>

1179
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.740
I mean I'm impulsive.
I don't make smart choices.
Come on.

1180
01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.440
<v 4>What I love about you is you don't give a fuck.
You're going to tell the truth.</v>

1181
01:07:23.441 --> 01:07:24.550
You're going to say whatever it is.

1182
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.610
<v 1>I wish I could back you up on this,</v>

1183
01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:29.820
but the problem is I can't remember a time where ever gave a fuck.

1184
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:34.110
I don't really think it was a conscious decision that's good.
Black of raising.

1185
01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:38.280
I was never raised.
I was raised by wolves.
I was thrown to the wild.

1186
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:41.820
I think really that's what it is.
I never developed a sense of decor.

1187
01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:46.530
I never developed a real sense of how you're supposed to behave and act and my

1188
01:07:46.531 --> 01:07:50.370
parents were always fucking busy and the people I hung out with were derelicts

1189
01:07:50.371 --> 01:07:55.140
and then fighters.
It was all just chaos from the time I was a young boy,

1190
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.540
there was never anything that made any sense to me,

1191
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.150
so I never figured out how to integrate.

1192
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.940
I was never integrated into any system.
Right.

1193
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:06.220
So it's almost like I was designed for this.
Like there's like,

1194
01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:10.350
like there's only one way to make someone who actually had Ronnie who was so

1195
01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:12.120
stupid.
They'll say anyone that's ironic.
Talk

1196
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.010
<v 4>about that is that you integrate so well cause you're funny and people like</v>

1197
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.843
<v 5>you because you're funny.</v>

1198
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.030
You know more about MMA than anyone I've ever met in my life,

1199
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:21.740
which is the fast growing sport in the world.

1200
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.160
You're like the most politically astute dude around it.
You know more about,

1201
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.820
you know,
more about more shit than anyone I've ever met.

1202
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:30.140
So you're saying I don't fit it.

1203
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:32.150
You probably fit in better than anyone I've ever seen.

1204
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.160
<v 1>Well it is the system that's broken.
It's not correct.</v>

1205
01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.440
What I have been very fortunate is that I grew up like this in a time or you can

1206
01:08:40.711 --> 01:08:45.711
access enormous amounts of information and during the last 20 years because of

1207
01:08:46.711 --> 01:08:50.310
this access to enormous amount of information,
no enormous amounts,

1208
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.630
my change,
my perspective on the world has changed radically.
Yeah.

1209
01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.740
My view has broadened its in an insane way that's impossible to describe.

1210
01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:05.760
But I think that I represent one,
I just,

1211
01:09:05.761 --> 01:09:10.650
I represent one portal that all,
almost everyone who's a part of the system,

1212
01:09:10.651 --> 01:09:14.880
whether they grew up in a way where they were forced to sort of integrate,

1213
01:09:14.881 --> 01:09:18.750
and they did things that I did do because they had a better upbringing and

1214
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:23.700
whatever it was,
they also see it.
But my position,

1215
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:28.230
my job is the lightening Rod.
I'm,
I'm the,
I'm the guy who's got a door open.

1216
01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:31.560
I'm like,
come on,
let's go.
This is a fucking a door.
I mean,
that's all it is.

1217
01:09:31.561 --> 01:09:35.190
It's just,
and what you guys are doing is way crazy,
but I'm doing,

1218
01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:37.530
what I'm doing is talking about what you guys are doing.

1219
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:41.760
You're off going to fucking North Korea and having lunch with these fucking

1220
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:46.660
psychopaths and you know,
you're going to visit slave camps where they,
they,
uh,

1221
01:09:46.661 --> 01:09:48.360
they,
uh,
they think they're in North Korea,

1222
01:09:48.361 --> 01:09:51.990
but they're actually in Russia when it was [inaudible].
They are rushing.
Yeah.

1223
01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.810
They think they're North Korea,
but they're actually in Russia.

1224
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.270
<v 5>Yeah.
They're in a slave concentration camps in North Korea,</v>

1225
01:09:58.271 --> 01:10:00.100
but they're actually in Russia doing slave labor.

1226
01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:05.160
<v 1>Yeah.
See you're going to all these places like the North Pole.
Well,</v>

1227
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.220
you're not going to see me there,
but I'll,
I'm the lightning rod.

1228
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:12.390
I'll stay right here.
All right.
Lights on.
Anytime you want to come by.

1229
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:17.160
We'll fucking,
we'll hit the switch and we'll broadcast as vice done.

1230
01:10:17.161 --> 01:10:19.680
Anything about the cove or anything about the dolphins

1231
01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.990
<v 5>situation up in Japan?
Yeah,
I noticed your hat there.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1232
01:10:24.991 --> 01:10:27.630
we have actually,
and,
and,
and uh,

1233
01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:31.530
we're doing a lot more on not just to cove,

1234
01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.570
which is a tiny problem.

1235
01:10:33.571 --> 01:10:38.090
It's actually a global problem in the fact that we've over fished.

1236
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:42.270
Everything says no more fish left.
And so now what we're doing is just,
you know,

1237
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.760
completely the only,

1238
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.440
the only fishermen left are the sort of,
you know,
the,

1239
01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:52.800
the bad ones who were like perceiving and taking the whole,
almost like pirates.

1240
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:56.070
Exactly.
They take the whole,
uh,
um,

1241
01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:01.350
tuna pod and they,
they,
they put a thing around,
they,
they,

1242
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.330
they moved the whole pod in one go and the dolphins and everything that,

1243
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:09.240
that haunted tuna and sharks,
everything,
they all get killed.

1244
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.290
They just would kill the fuck out of everything.
Like we're really good at it.

1245
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.330
Japanese are ruthless when it comes to that shit.
Quite frankly,
we're all routes.

1246
01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.330
We're all ruthless withdrawal,
rootless.

1247
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.500
He knows every single nation that fishes.

1248
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.810
So I'm from Canada originally and the,
there was a time when the ships,

1249
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:34.710
the joke was the f the ships couldn't get through the grand banks,
uh,

1250
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:38.280
off the new Brunswick because the,
there were so many fish.

1251
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.190
There's no fish left anymore.
And by the way,
your,

1252
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:44.010
your people who deny everything,
when I say they're like,

1253
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.110
the seals ate all the fuck.

1254
01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:48.390
If he had a look and see what we should have the seal hunt,

1255
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.240
it wasn't the Portuguese,
the Japanese,
the Canadians,

1256
01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:55.570
the Americans who fucking perceived it for fucking 50 years and ate all the God

1257
01:11:55.571 --> 01:11:58.440
damn fish and threw everything else out.
No,
it wasn't that.

1258
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:02.590
It was the fucking seals.
Anyway,
we have destroyed the,

1259
01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.230
the fish stocks.
There's no more fucking fish.
We were like,

1260
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.750
like now everything has to be farmed,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1261
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.160
There's no more fish in the grand banks.

1262
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:14.640
It was the biggest fish stocks in the fucking world.
Why?

1263
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:18.750
Because we used to fish,
you know,
we used to fish a certain way.

1264
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.640
Then we just said,
fucking take all the fish,
take everything,
take it up.

1265
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:25.530
Just scoop the fucking whole fucking side of the ocean and we'll just take it.

1266
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:30.240
Is it because of just an economic need?
Economical needs,
Amish.

1267
01:12:30.241 --> 01:12:32.490
There's more people.
If you,
if you go to any store,

1268
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:35.900
this is an interesting thing that I,
you go to any store in the world,
any story.

1269
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.240
You can be in Congo,
you can be in Australia,

1270
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:42.690
you can be in Vietnam,
Myanmar,
you can be here in America.

1271
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.540
You know what they're going to have on the,
on the,

1272
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.620
on the shelf of any shitty Bodega and the fucking world.
Tuna,

1273
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:55.220
canned tuna fish.
So it's like a staple.
And when you realize the,

1274
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.880
the stakes that we're talking now,

1275
01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.990
like I was doing this a piece on fake food in China.

1276
01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:04.650
They have fake eggs right now.
What is that?
And I'm like,
you have fake eggs.

1277
01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:05.360
So they're making a,

1278
01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.140
a fake soya construct for the shell and a fake chemical thing for the thing and

1279
01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:14.100
the Yolk.
I'm like,
how much is the fucking egg costs?
Like an egg is free.

1280
01:13:14.101 --> 01:13:15.840
You get a chicken,
fucking eggs come out.

1281
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.770
How much does it take to make a chemical egg?
You know,

1282
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.710
there's must cost a lot more than the actual egg itself.

1283
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:25.650
It doesn't make any sense.
There's no eggs in China,
you know,

1284
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.890
there's no milk in China,
so they're just buying all the dairies and France,

1285
01:13:28.891 --> 01:13:32.820
it was a big article today.
They need food.
So they're making fake food.

1286
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.510
But you sit there and you say,
okay tuna,
it's on every,

1287
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.230
every single country in the world.
It has to,
well,
there's no more tuna.

1288
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.460
We ate it all cause everybody eats tuna.
When you start saying that,

1289
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:48.380
everybody has to have that one thing because you're like,
all these,

1290
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:52.650
the biggest corporations in the world,
what do they sell?
Light Bulbs,

1291
01:13:52.651 --> 01:13:56.130
Tampons,
you know,
toothbrushes,

1292
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.110
shit that everybody needs.
I,

1293
01:13:58.111 --> 01:14:01.050
every single person in the world needs a fucking toothbrush or light bulbs.

1294
01:14:01.051 --> 01:14:04.680
So they make billions of our tuna,
right?
There's no more tuna.

1295
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.850
So what the fuck did they do?
They say,
well,
just take everything.
Take the kids,

1296
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.480
take the eggs,
take the fucking,
you know,
the adults take the,

1297
01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:16.530
the breeding females,
take everybody,
chop it up,
put it in the fucking tuna can.

1298
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:20.980
Wow.
And that's the problem is food.
Where,
and by the way,

1299
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:24.100
this is happening now with beef,
I know you're into grassfed beef.

1300
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:29.020
Beef now is a huge problem.
Prices skyrocketing.
Why?

1301
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.340
Because now everybody wants beef.

1302
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.320
There's people have been born boxes and so now beef prices are going through the

1303
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:35.800
roof.

1304
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.220
<v 1>They're also getting sneaky with their grass fed.
A hundred percent,</v>

1305
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.650
hundred percent grass fed.
You can go to whole foods.

1306
01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:45.430
They have this new thing that they're doing,
what they call it,
pasture raised.

1307
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.570
Have you seen that?

1308
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:50.180
<v 5>Look,
beef is fucked.
Fishes.
Fuck.</v>

1309
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:53.060
Protein in general is fucked because it's expensive.

1310
01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:57.740
It's expensive to fucking rear and,
and,
and,
and,
and make happen.

1311
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.080
But fish by the way,

1312
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:04.640
is the scariest because we've over fished to the point where there are like,

1313
01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.800
unless it's farmed,
we're fucked.

1314
01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.000
And it doesn't seem like there's any light at the end of the tunnel.
Well,

1315
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.941
this is the thing,

1316
01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:14.210
and I keep saying this when I come on the show is where all the adults like,

1317
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.820
okay,
isn't it?
Like if there's,

1318
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:22.330
if the option is we can stop eating so much fish for a little bit and then have

1319
01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:26.630
fish forever or we can just keep on eating all the fucking fish and then never

1320
01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:28.880
have fish forever ever again.

1321
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.240
Wouldn't it be the same decision to say let's eat a little bit less fish so we

1322
01:15:35.091 --> 01:15:38.930
can all have fish where no,
we're actually doing the opposite and saying,

1323
01:15:38.931 --> 01:15:42.800
well no one actually has the the cause.
If we don't do it,

1324
01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.240
then the Japanese will do it and if the Japanese are doing it,

1325
01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:46.860
then we have to do it.
So we're all going to just

1326
01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.731
<v 1>eat all the food.
Well,</v>

1327
01:15:47.731 --> 01:15:50.970
you don't hear about that story because it's important to talk about Miley Cyrus

1328
01:15:50.971 --> 01:15:53.430
twerking.
Very important.

1329
01:15:53.431 --> 01:15:57.270
We don't have time for your torn tuna nonsense.
When young Miley,

1330
01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.140
she was Hannah Montana and now she's twerking.
Yeah.

1331
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.200
It's disturbing that you don't hear more of it.

1332
01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:07.500
And I think that's an issue with most people that follow the mainstream media.

1333
01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.250
Most people that work a nine to five plus,
you know,
commuting time,

1334
01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:15.360
they simply do not have time.
10 it's hard.
It's very hard.

1335
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.690
<v 5>Life is hard.
Yeah.</v>

1336
01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.770
And you don't want to come home and have a couple of old motherfuckers like us.

1337
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:24.130
Yeah.
Guess what?
All the fishes gone.
You fucking dirty bastard.

1338
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.160
Stop eating your fucking tuna fish sandwich.

1339
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:31.720
You don't want to be on the fucking sub.
Look,
it's,
it's hard.
It's difficult.

1340
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:35.530
But the problem is is the bill is not only in the mail,

1341
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:38.100
it's been fucking deliver.
We did.

1342
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:42.820
We did a lot of bad things for a long time and now the bill has been delivered

1343
01:16:42.821 --> 01:16:46.540
and we're sitting here going,
there's no more fish.
Boys.
Sorry.

1344
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:52.030
Like,
and by the way,
guess what?
We're not going to wake up.

1345
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.070
This is the sad thing about humans.

1346
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.060
We're not going to wake up until you walk into the quickie mart or the seven

1347
01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:01.210
level,
whatever the fuck it is,
and there's no more tune on the shelves.
You Go,

1348
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.840
what happened to the fucking tune,
Huh?
Yeah,
we ate it at all yet.

1349
01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.170
<v 1>That's a weird thing about us,
isn't it?
That we,
we,
we have that issue.</v>

1350
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.160
We don't recognize things until it's like,

1351
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.570
it's like they say about addicts that addicts have to hit rock fucking bottom

1352
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:16.190
before they'll stop doing drugs.

1353
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:19.310
Like they have to have overdoses where they're almost dead.

1354
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:23.420
Change addicts would humans.
Yeah.
Well it's,
well,
that's what I'm saying.
I mean,

1355
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:24.550
I think it's,
it's,

1356
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:28.670
it's a similar thing that we do when we get into patterns like guys who are

1357
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:32.420
gambling addicts.
You ever met a gambling addict?
Well,
in the unit,
you're fine.

1358
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:35.730
Listen,
you're fine.
No,
he's fine to there.

1359
01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:37.340
But you're talking about too wealthy guys,

1360
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.330
this scary gambling addicts of the guys who are broke who have to fucking bet.

1361
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:46.250
I knew this guy's name was white plains,
Charlie white plains,
Joe White Plains.

1362
01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:47.750
Charlie might've weighed 50 pounds.

1363
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:50.870
He used to hang out at the pool hall that I used to go to and he was a real good

1364
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:53.330
pool player.
But he's an old man who was a gambling junkie,

1365
01:17:53.331 --> 01:17:56.600
used to steal candy bars and the Pool Hall and you see him fucking sneaky.

1366
01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:58.490
I mean he just needed some form nutrition.

1367
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:03.920
All White Plains Charlie would do all day was gamble in one way or another.

1368
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:05.150
He lived in a boarding house.

1369
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:09.260
He like had a room somewhere or a bed or somewhere and he was probably,

1370
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:13.190
when I met him,
probably deep in his sixties white plains,

1371
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:16.070
Charlie's to go to the fucking horse races every day and he would come to the

1372
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:19.910
pool hall after you went to the horse races and like this mother Fucker,

1373
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:24.980
I bet this horse,
this fucking,
I'm like,
come on your cock sucker.
It always,

1374
01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:27.980
same story,
always losing.
And if he did have some money,

1375
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.730
you could tell because he was all squirrely and he could see him and everybody

1376
01:18:31.731 --> 01:18:33.800
knew and then he would wind up gambling and losing that money.

1377
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.560
But these poor fucks,
man,
they,

1378
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.700
they could never just get a job,
get their shit together.

1379
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.880
They were addicted to these weird thrills and they would hit rock bottom and

1380
01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:47.630
just scraped together enough money.

1381
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:50.150
And then they decided somewhere along the line,

1382
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:53.960
Charlie decided to just live at rock bottom.
Rock bottom was where he was.

1383
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:55.370
He always smelled.

1384
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:59.750
He would take cigarettes out of ash trays and light them up again.
And you know,

1385
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:04.310
he's essentially not homeless,
but might've well been homeless,
was always broke,

1386
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:07.610
always bumming money,
always asking someone to stay,
come,

1387
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:10.480
this motherfucker can't beat me.
I'm gonna play this motherfucker.

1388
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.650
I'm going to rob him.
You're gonna,
we're gonna make it a lot of money.

1389
01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:15.620
Come on man.
Come on man.
Back then,
back me up on it.
It was,

1390
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.850
and he was just addicted to it and he,
he would crash and just keep going.

1391
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.180
And there's a lot of people like that when it comes to anything.

1392
01:19:23.181 --> 01:19:27.050
And I think that's a human characteristics,
this denial and this,

1393
01:19:27.051 --> 01:19:29.630
this ability to rationalize the position that you're in.

1394
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.000
And I think as a species we do that,

1395
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:35.750
<v 5>well,
I forget,
I'm going to misquote this,
I'm going to butcher it,</v>

1396
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:37.910
but there's a definition of insanity,

1397
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:43.690
which is we go to bed every night with the same thing facing us and the same

1398
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.580
conditions facing us the next day and we wake up thinking it's going to be

1399
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:50.240
different.

1400
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.041
<v 1>Yeah,
that's the,
the,</v>

1401
01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:55.160
the simplified version is the definition of insanity is doing the exact same

1402
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:56.840
thing and expecting a different result.

1403
01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.773
<v 5>Correct.</v>

1404
01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.010
Which is basically the definition of humanity and the definition of history.

1405
01:20:02.011 --> 01:20:02.110
Well,

1406
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:05.660
<v 1>it's also one of the reasons why we're such bad motherfuckers that we're able to</v>

1407
01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:07.740
like put things aside and trudge ahead

1408
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.310
<v 5>the definition of,
of religion because they're like,
yeah,</v>

1409
01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:16.420
it's shitty again today,
but guess what?
When you're dead,

1410
01:20:16.421 --> 01:20:20.900
it's going to be awesome.
Jesus will be there.
Re pour that in other,

1411
01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.180
you had another bad day.
It's sucked again and you worked real hard.

1412
01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.470
But when you're dead

1413
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.630
<v 1>Kimanzi Fred Phelps is dead.
You know that the Westboro Baptist Church guy died.</v>

1414
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.010
You imagine the day,
if Jesus is real,

1415
01:20:34.011 --> 01:20:38.270
the day that that guy meets Jesus and Jesus is like,

1416
01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.380
<v 5>that's not what I meant.
Right.
That's all my,</v>

1417
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.340
you know what I love about it is like I go,

1418
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:48.520
I travel a lot to hardcore Islamic countries and they were like,

1419
01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:49.930
yeah,

1420
01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:54.160
you know you're going to jihad and and suicide bombers and you're going to go to

1421
01:20:54.161 --> 01:20:58.360
paradise.
You're going to have versions,
and you're like,
yeah,
it's fucking crazy.

1422
01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.740
And you'd come back to American,

1423
01:20:59.741 --> 01:21:04.310
like those motherfucking Taliban and alcaide Qaeda,
they're crazy motherfuckers.

1424
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.970
They believe they're going to fucking die and she had to go to heaven.

1425
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.830
What do you guys believe?
We believe Jewish zombies.

1426
01:21:11.831 --> 01:21:12.920
The walk on water,

1427
01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.140
that I get to work everyday and have a bad life every,
every,

1428
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.430
every day of my life and then I'm going to fucking die and go to heaven.
Yeah,

1429
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:25.010
well we don't believe in virgins,
so it's less,
it's less for,

1430
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:29.680
the promise is get 70 virgins,
but I live on a cloud and eat Velveeta cheese.

1431
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.270
<v 1>Our Shit is more reasonable and updated.
Their shit is very ancient,</v>

1432
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:34.440
like they're dealing with it.

1433
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:38.820
I believe that what's going on in the Middle East is that the Middle East,

1434
01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:41.190
I've said this before,
is the cradle of civilization.

1435
01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:45.330
That's where Mesopotamia was.
Babylon.
That's where Sumir was.
Everyone.

1436
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:49.950
I think Turkey that mean the oldest known civilization that's built complex

1437
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:53.370
structures is in go Beckley Tapi in Turkey.

1438
01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:56.940
This new thing that they found over the last decade,
incredible structures.

1439
01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.470
The people that are still there,
I think are the townies of the world.

1440
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.120
That's what I think it's like,

1441
01:22:03.121 --> 01:22:06.780
it's like when you go back to where you grew up and all those assholes that stay

1442
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:09.870
there just so backwards and outdated.

1443
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.650
I go to where I grew up and I see my friends,
it's still in the same town like,

1444
01:22:13.651 --> 01:22:17.740
fuck man.
Like you guys gotta get Outta here fucking fired.

1445
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:22.190
He's wanting to get fucking married.
They got to eat.

1446
01:22:22.191 --> 01:22:26.840
You're a tennis shoe.
Newton Newton,
Massachusetts,
Newton upper falls.
Um,

1447
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.730
and that's actually a great place to live.
And I'm just talking shit.

1448
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.370
But what I'm talking about is that there are certain people that live in an area

1449
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.660
and that area has an ideology that's very rigid.
And they never get out of it.

1450
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:41.820
Yeah.
These,
this because they,

1451
01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:45.750
their ideology was created 15,000 years ago.

1452
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:48.630
They have the echoes of that retarded civilization,

1453
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.860
but thought the world was flat

1454
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:50.771
<v 5>worship goats.</v>

1455
01:22:50.771 --> 01:22:55.750
The interesting thing about Islam though is it was created as much as you say,

1456
01:22:56.170 --> 01:23:00.280
as a,
uh,
it was basically a,
remember by the way,

1457
01:23:00.281 --> 01:23:03.310
watch a jihad be a announced we're flat wall.

1458
01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:07.280
I mean it was created because went to Jay and said,
oh this,

1459
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:09.100
there's this new Christian thing going on.

1460
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.480
So that was this monotheistic thing saying,
oh,
there's this new one,
God religion.

1461
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:14.740
I'm going to take that on.

1462
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.390
So Judaism actually in the Koran it says people are the book.

1463
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:21.580
There's the Jews and the Christians and the Muslims,

1464
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:25.360
and they're all the same because of the monotheistic and you say,
oh,
okay,

1465
01:23:25.361 --> 01:23:28.240
well that's,
that's interesting people of the book,
you know,

1466
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:32.230
we're all in it together.
Why the fuck have you been a,
you know,

1467
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:37.000
fighting us the whole time?
Well,
we have different versions of heaven.

1468
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:41.770
<v 3>Well,
how about the Islamic people themselves have to different sects of Islam,</v>

1469
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:43.390
the shadow each other to the death,

1470
01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.510
which is a lot more than two but two big ones.
The big one.

1471
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:50.060
And I ran as Sunni and Shia that we didn't know about it and I racked when when

1472
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.680
people started blowing each other up in Iraq and we found out that it was

1473
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:58.180
Islamic people attacking rival Islamic sex.
We were like,

1474
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.270
wait a minute,
how crazy are these fucking people?

1475
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:03.290
This is a civil war amongst both bullshit.

1476
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:08.050
<v 5>Exactly.
What I was trying to get to is Judaism,
Christianity,</v>

1477
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.250
Islam are basically the same religion they started yeah.

1478
01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:17.860
Rooted.
Exactly.
There you go.
Yeah.
And so and so there people,
the book,
etc. Etc.

1479
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:19.180
And you sit there and saying,

1480
01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.690
your definition of having this different than my debt or your definition of this

1481
01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:24.370
is different.
Or Jesus was a prophet,

1482
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:27.340
but Mohammed was a real prophet and there and you say,
okay,

1483
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:31.300
because of all that we're going to kill the fuck out of each other for a long

1484
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:35.620
fucking time.
And at that point you're like,
well this is just fucking stew.
Well,

1485
01:24:35.621 --> 01:24:38.740
it's all fucking stupid because Saugus we look at them and say,
Oh,

1486
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:41.700
you're going to get 70 virgins because you blew yourself up with the suicide,

1487
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:45.310
but Stephanie to you're fucking ridiculous.
However,

1488
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:49.050
I'm going to go to heaven and live on a cloud with my fucking savior.
Jesus.
How,

1489
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.530
how is that any fucking diff?

1490
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.270
<v 3>It's just as ridiculous.
But the,
the,
you know the term 72 virgins apparently.</v>

1491
01:24:54.271 --> 01:24:59.160
What they mean when they say 72,
seven 72 is like,
uh,

1492
01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:03.900
like you would say a fucking kazillion.
Yeah.
You know,
like you would get 72.

1493
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.840
It's just,
there's one thing I'm saying,

1494
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:11.250
it was actually meant 70 to raise on this fun raisins.
Look,

1495
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.120
the fact of the matter is that we,
yeah,
it was raised in and that's not,

1496
01:25:15.121 --> 01:25:18.890
I'm not that up.
Google it.
Fucking skimpy little walk.

1497
01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:23.880
I want you to fucking back me up on the raisins.
There was only 72 I'd be pissed.

1498
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:29.470
Yeah,
exactly.
All that bit,
that old school.
But yeah,
the,
uh,

1499
01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.730
the idea that 72 raisins is a lot of raisins.

1500
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.610
It's just as insulting as 72 virgins in heaven.

1501
01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:39.600
But what's interesting is is is those religions were created.

1502
01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:44.070
Muslim martyrs get 72 raises instead of versions.
Oh God.
Is that up there?

1503
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:49.680
Hey,
well,
we believe you're a good,
very good,
right?
That's Google's good.

1504
01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:54.300
Very good.
Read books.
The kid didn't go out,
get an encyclopedia,

1505
01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:58.020
ran outside with his library card.
I just typed

1506
01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.000
in a future.
You want to be,
there you go.
It's,
it's tying it back to information.

1507
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.340
How about the fact

1508
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.580
<v 5>that we have all information in the world,
in the history of the world,</v>

1509
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.860
at our fingertips at all times.
It's crazy.
Those other things.

1510
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:15.800
I was gonna say you,
you're exactly right.
When you said the freedom,

1511
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:19.150
the freedom of information and the freedom.
I want to know

1512
01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.930
<v 1>it will save us,
but it will change us.
It's going to change everything.</v>

1513
01:26:21.931 --> 01:26:25.380
It will change us,
but it will save us.
Look,
if it was just us,

1514
01:26:25.410 --> 01:26:27.990
this is something I like to do all the time,
at least to play this game,

1515
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:32.550
but it was only us four.
It was Brian,
Jamie,
you and I,

1516
01:26:32.551 --> 01:26:35.760
and we were the only people on earth will be in trouble.
You could read my email.

1517
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:39.030
Who Cares?
I'm emailing you guys.
You know,
I mean,
you could,

1518
01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.210
you could borrow my food.
There's only four of us.
There's only four of us.

1519
01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:45.960
All the food we have.
We better fucking cherish all the vegetables we have.

1520
01:26:45.961 --> 01:26:49.390
We better fucking shares.
If you build a dope house,
um,

1521
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.500
and you spend all your time building that dope house,
I mean,

1522
01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:55.980
that's your house and all.
I should probably build my own house,
but you know,

1523
01:26:55.981 --> 01:26:59.130
we would help each other.
You couldn't really build a house on your own.

1524
01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:01.440
We would need each other.
Why wouldn't we?
Right.

1525
01:27:01.441 --> 01:27:04.440
We don't necessarily need each other when there's 300 million of us.

1526
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:09.000
And so we have a real issue or 7 billion and we have a real issue,

1527
01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:11.970
but we're going to be able to read each other's minds,
ma'am.

1528
01:27:11.971 --> 01:27:16.971
That is common and we're going to need real and not purity of thought because

1529
01:27:17.221 --> 01:27:18.900
there's nothing wrong with being preferred.

1530
01:27:19.170 --> 01:27:23.630
We have to understand that we are perverted all the things.
Yeah.

1531
01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:28.610
The things that people enjoy,
sex and talking shit and jerking off and,

1532
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:32.760
and all the nonsense that we enjoy is a part of us.

1533
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:37.790
It's a part of our animal life and we hide a lot of these things because of our

1534
01:27:37.801 --> 01:27:40.650
culture.
We hide a lot of these things because of,
you know,

1535
01:27:40.651 --> 01:27:43.470
we want to have jobs and we want to have,
you know,

1536
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.760
there's another bottle of that Jack over there at the bottom.
Oh Shit.

1537
01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:53.060
It's another bottle of Jack o Lantern Sodie pop with extra vitamin C.

1538
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:56.300
It's,
it's a,

1539
01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.400
it's a part of what we are and we're shielding ourselves from our sexuality and

1540
01:28:02.551 --> 01:28:04.710
our reality by hiding.

1541
01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:08.790
I'm bullshitting all that bullshit and hiding the things that I don't have to do

1542
01:28:08.791 --> 01:28:11.520
because I'm a comedian.
The things that Brian is now to do,

1543
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:16.700
we can say crazy shit about what we've done and what we do and drugs and sex and

1544
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:20.430
nonsense.

1545
01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:24.840
We can talk about all that because there's no expectations on us to be normal.

1546
01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:29.070
We're comedians were,
we're entertainers.
We're crazy people.

1547
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.840
But for the average person,

1548
01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.990
the average person can make with a fucking corporate job,

1549
01:28:33.991 --> 01:28:37.550
can't make a youtube video about doing DMT and getting blown by angel.
Yeah.

1550
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:41.060
<v 5>Talk about this before.
I don't know because my brain is softening,</v>

1551
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.920
but targeting when we remembering important shit.
Pardon me,

1552
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:50.240
but I don't know if we talked about this.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1553
01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:52.490
it's a good thing cause I've just forgotten my question,

1554
01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.330
but hold on.
What

1555
01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.800
<v 1>by what I was saying was that the expectations on a guys like me and Brian,</v>

1556
01:29:00.801 --> 01:29:02.280
they don't exist because

1557
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.400
<v 5>we're already silly.
We're were ridiculous people that are,</v>

1558
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:08.580
it's fine if we talk about drugs.
It's fine if we talk about sex.

1559
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.010
That was the thing you were saying that,
yeah.

1560
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.620
So I don't know if we talked about this before,

1561
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:19.010
but what I find disturbing about political representation is I,

1562
01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:24.870
I've done a lot of crazy shit.
I left home when I was like 13 and a half.

1563
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:28.450
I've been a bad boy.
I've been a robber.
I'd be alarmed.
Yeah,

1564
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:32.130
I did a lot of bad things.
I drank a lot,
did a lot of drugs,

1565
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:35.790
did a lot of crazy things.
The fact that our politicians,

1566
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.550
and this is one thing that freaked me out of it,

1567
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.190
Mitt Romney is here's a guy who didn't ever do anything.

1568
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.550
And by the way,
I don't want someone who never did anything.

1569
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.420
I want someone who's done everything.
I want someone who reflects me.

1570
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.460
So when people say,
you know what chain,

1571
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:55.620
you fucking did drugs and you fuck you fucking did this and you fucking whacked

1572
01:29:55.621 --> 01:30:00.570
off and you fucking come sot and Vassar.
I'm like,
yes,

1573
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:05.760
I'm fucking human human.
And by the way,
I would like a politician to say,

1574
01:30:05.761 --> 01:30:06.720
yeah,
whacked off from,

1575
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:11.721
came in my fucking back fucking fucking drunk because that's how we are as

1576
01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:14.160
normal,
normal,
normal.

1577
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:18.390
The fact that we have people who have to be squeaky clean,

1578
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:21.450
which nobody is by the way,
and the fact that you have to be,
to me,

1579
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:24.180
if you're squeaky clean,
you got 20 fucking dead bodies in your,

1580
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.290
in your goddamn basement.

1581
01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:28.140
Cause I don't trust those motherfuckers who are squeaking or your cries,

1582
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.600
never met anyone who squeaky clean.

1583
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.920
And nor do I want to worry human.
And what you're saying is exactly right.

1584
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:38.340
You're a fucking freaky business.
I've got freaky business.

1585
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.290
Everyone's got freaky business.

1586
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.640
Now do I want everyone in the world to know that I've had some freaky business?

1587
01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:49.170
Yeah,
probably.
Probably not,

1588
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.820
but that's because everybody else can hide their freaky business when there's no

1589
01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:56.600
highs.
I don't mind about just some things I do.
There's something,

1590
01:30:56.601 --> 01:30:59.420
but what I'm trying to get at is what I,

1591
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:04.050
what I would like from my representation is humanity.
Yeah,
right.

1592
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:08.960
Like we all fuck up.
We all do crazy shit.
We all do some fucking t.
There's,

1593
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:12.630
if I look back,
well,
you fucking admit to everything.
You're like,
oh fuck.

1594
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:15.600
Every fish would be nice if that wiener guy,

1595
01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:20.190
if the guy who was running up Andrew Wiener,
he went,
hey,
look,
yes I did.

1596
01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:24.810
Yes I did,
but I'm not even him.

1597
01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:28.560
The guy running against him.
What if he said,
who cares?
The Guy,

1598
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:32.340
the guy likes to email chicks pictures of his dick.
What are you?

1599
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:34.830
What are you killing?
Fuck,
it's just sex.

1600
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.980
What does that have anything to do with the economy?
Well,
his character,

1601
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:43.230
well that's,
that's what they do,
but that's what they do.
Yeah.

1602
01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:47.010
That's what they do.
The thing is is is,
is to go after character.

1603
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:50.430
And my thing is when they go after my character,
I go,
yes sir,

1604
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:55.470
I did that,
but put it in the bum bum and I don't feel bad about it.

1605
01:31:55.471 --> 01:32:00.250
I'm never done that.
You don't have to be squeaky clean guy

1606
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.340
<v 3>because the expectations aren't on you in that job.</v>

1607
01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:08.260
But we have this weird expectation that our politicians are savior or why

1608
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:13.030
politicians had represent us and they don't.
If they don't do ever,

1609
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.340
and if they never do anything bad,

1610
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.900
then they don't represent us because we all do batch or by the way,
what's bad.

1611
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:22.090
We all do human shit.
Well that's the,

1612
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.600
why the fuck aren't our politicians representative of who we are,

1613
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:28.450
which is all doing human shit.
Well,
let's put it into perspective.

1614
01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:30.010
This will probably help this discussion.

1615
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:34.750
This whole idea of voting for someone is 200 years old.

1616
01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:39.820
Human culture has been around for 10,000 who knows how many thousands of years

1617
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:44.830
voting for someone is really new.
Okay,
so you,

1618
01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:49.780
it's a popularity contest instead of a monarchy instead of a dictatorship.

1619
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.150
Instead of wish it was a popularity contest.

1620
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.750
It's a name recognition contest because you don't know the other fucking names.

1621
01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.560
That's why he's all this commercials and all this bullshit rigged popularity

1622
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:04.540
contest between two parties that are both represented by the same monopolies and

1623
01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.980
giant corporations.

1624
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:10.270
But it's still this new thing that they're trying to figure out to us.

1625
01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.020
It'll go through a whole time and I'm here quoting Smedley Butler wars just to

1626
01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:14.780
rack it.

1627
01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:19.780
Well that's just because the politicians have really only existed in this form

1628
01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:23.590
for a briefs
came of time.

1629
01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:27.400
A twitch at the king was born into power.
Exactly.

1630
01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:31.190
Now we have to find these fucking guys and they always have,
but that's a user.

1631
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.520
Everyone's like,
Oh Hillary Clinton's going to win.
And you're like,
wait,

1632
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:36.550
cause they know her name,
they know the fucking name.

1633
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:41.410
Unless it comes out that Hillary Clinton is stuff and babies backup or pussy and

1634
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:46.000
smothering them.
Well that will come out.
It lasts.
That's less that comes out.

1635
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:49.680
Yeah.
She's got a good show.
I frankly don't think that she'll run and I,

1636
01:33:49.681 --> 01:33:52.100
and I'm just going to pause.
I thought you were going to say I was quite fine.

1637
01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:55.980
If you don't think she's Tufts babies up,
I'll go.
Listen man,
this is now,

1638
01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:00.490
I'm not being literal.
I don't think she'll run because I think,

1639
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:04.570
I think look,
name recognition is there.
Maybe she won't.
I don't know,

1640
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:07.390
but I don't think she'll run because she's old.
She's sick.

1641
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:10.990
Things are coming out now that she's,
she's got health issues.
She is,

1642
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:13.660
she has health issues.
Has A,
what is it,
by the way?

1643
01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:15.790
I don't even know if the health issues are true.

1644
01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.570
They're making a big deal about them.
Well,
she's an older woman.

1645
01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.460
I mean he's old or older men.
Older women.

1646
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.280
They have health issues you sign or sixties right?
How old is she?
She's quiet.
Oh,

1647
01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:28.810
well let's look it up.
I don't know.
I don't want to get caught out.
I would say,

1648
01:34:28.811 --> 01:34:33.580
I'm going to guess I'd say she's 62 68 oh no,
I got it.
Fucking ass.

1649
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:38.890
That's what he said.
Cause he was like a little trike.
Clinton,
Clintons,

1650
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:44.530
Bill Clinton is very old guy.
She's 66 years old.
Yeah.

1651
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.430
So look,
she gets elected at 68 that's when people start dying.

1652
01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:51.730
You know what I mean?
That's,
that's,
I mean we used to make fun of Reagan.

1653
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.960
Reagan was in his soul.
Was He?
He was in his seventies looking at it.
Is that it?

1654
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.340
Was he in the sense,
I believe so.

1655
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:00.970
I believe using a seventies when he was president,
it's all his.
He was a,

1656
01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.020
because there was that Dennis Miller joke,
he was a bit,

1657
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.760
he was a bit Daughtery my grandfather to 72 and we don't let them use a remote

1658
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:11.960
control for the TV.
He has a bit Daughtery now everybody's like,

1659
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:16.240
Oh fuck Reagan.
Reagan.
He was,
oh my God,
can I,

1660
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.410
can I ask you another question?
Please do.

1661
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:23.960
The Republicans are all getting in line to say,
I'm a Reagan Republican.
Reagan,

1662
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:25.160
Reagan,
Reagan,
Reagan,
Reagan.

1663
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:30.680
Why isn't the Democratic Party saying lining up saying,

1664
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:35.681
I'm a fucking Clinton centrist fucking took the worst deficits in American

1665
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.910
history to the biggest surplus in American history.

1666
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:43.190
Best President fucking serving in,
in,
in the 1900 or 1900.

1667
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.260
Uh,
why,
why,
why,
why is he so vilified in this condo?

1668
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:51.770
Lewinski character?
He got a blow job.

1669
01:35:51.771 --> 01:35:55.070
So the fact that he was probably the greatest president of the last century,

1670
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:55.850
he goes out the window,

1671
01:35:55.850 --> 01:36:00.850
he disparaged the great office of the presidency with his penis.

1672
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.710
Do you know what he would do to women?

1673
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.160
He would get them alone and pull his penis as opposed to,

1674
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:10.810
as opposed to every other president except for Ronald Reagan because his parents

1675
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.860
didn't work.
I wonder,
you know what the standard move was before Viagra.
I wonder,

1676
01:36:15.861 --> 01:36:16.191
you know,

1677
01:36:16.191 --> 01:36:18.950
like if at a certain point in time you would trust a president because they

1678
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:23.520
didn't get hard ons anymore.
There's a book by Plato,
uh,

1679
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:27.710
called the gorgeous where the main guy and it says,

1680
01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:32.711
I only became a good politician when I put all the passions behind me cause he's

1681
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.131
like 70,

1682
01:36:34.131 --> 01:36:37.670
and he couldn't get his dick hard anymore and he could just be reasonable.

1683
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:38.850
And He,

1684
01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:43.670
that was the foundation of democracy was my dick doesn't work anymore so I'll

1685
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:47.930
just start democracies.
I ruin everyone else's lives.
That was,

1686
01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:51.590
well it was the founder.
I maybe that was gorgeous.
That was,

1687
01:36:51.591 --> 01:36:53.800
that was the first book of uh,

1688
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:58.790
Plato who Socrates never wrote anything,
played a road at all.

1689
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:03.320
He said,
Socrates said this and then that was the foundation of democracy.

1690
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.720
It didn't really ruin into Friday.
Medic is back then their,

1691
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.880
their ideas of civilization are pretty fucking loose.

1692
01:37:07.881 --> 01:37:09.740
He compared to what care act made he,

1693
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:13.400
Socrates and Plato or both fucking little boys left and right.

1694
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.650
And it was only,
it was only the,
the dudes,
you know,
there was like,

1695
01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:21.920
you know,
a hundred people,
slave owners and could vote.

1696
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:26.870
So we're going to base it on their democracy where they went to the Agora and

1697
01:37:26.871 --> 01:37:28.190
said Yay or nay.

1698
01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.060
Do you think the future presidents would definitely like embraced the whole

1699
01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:36.500
Clinton thing?
Because look at Obama with doing that video.
What do you mean?

1700
01:37:36.501 --> 01:37:41.040
Like the whole Clinton thing,
Obama just did a video is Zach outfit.

1701
01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:43.070
It's a lot of heat from,

1702
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:47.120
and that's kind of showing like a really cool prize in,
in my opinion.

1703
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.230
What do you mean by getting heat?

1704
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:53.060
I mean a good way or a bad way he's been getting for doing that video.

1705
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:56.020
But what do you mean by heat?
Bad Way,
bad,
bad way.
Saying that the

1706
01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.410
<v 5>PR,
there's a lot of people think like Fox News especially,</v>

1707
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:01.710
I think that the president shouldn't be put in that kind of situation even

1708
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:03.930
though that he was like on,
you know,
presidents in the past,

1709
01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:06.900
I've done Jay Leno and shit like that.
They just don't remember

1710
01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:12.210
exactly.
But I wish,

1711
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:17.420
I wish that Democrats would embrace Clinton as Republicans have embraced Reagan.

1712
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:22.410
Reagan when I grew up was a joke.
He was a daughtering old guy.
Didn't know shit.

1713
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.230
Yeah,
me too.
And now they're like,
oh fucking,
I'm better.

1714
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:28.650
I'm more Reagan in your Reagan.
Well,
I grew up as Clinton.

1715
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:33.540
Everyone's like,
get the fuck away from him.
And you're like,
hold on a second.

1716
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.550
This guy took the largest deficit in the history of a fucking America and turned

1717
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:42.180
it into largest,
a surplus.
Now they,
they,

1718
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:46.570
they credit Reagan for that.
But it was under Clinton and you know,

1719
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:50.850
this guy was like a consensus politician.
You know,

1720
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:55.080
he worked with the Republicans.
They actually,
the government actually worked,

1721
01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:58.380
which it doesn't do now.
Why wouldn't Obama,

1722
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.970
why wouldn't the Democrats say I'm a fucking Clintonism?
They don't.

1723
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:07.740
Because the Republicans did such a fucking great job at,

1724
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.671
by the way,
in a,

1725
01:39:08.671 --> 01:39:13.671
an amazing politician and a consensus politician being destroyed because he

1726
01:39:13.711 --> 01:39:16.930
liked to fuck.
Well,
people help them other than the Republicans.

1727
01:39:16.931 --> 01:39:19.590
The goddamn Democrats helped him.
Women helped him.

1728
01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:24.120
Democrat men who are pussies and white knights,
they helped him.
Everybody helped.

1729
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:28.800
They all pointed at him.
I wouldn't do that.
Why you fucked up?

1730
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.670
Maybe it would.
Maybe you will have.
You're a fat guy with a giant penis nose.

1731
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:36.030
It was all of a sudden president and everybody wants to touch you.
Yeah,

1732
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:39.100
you probably do some crazy shit.
Probably can't even believe you're doing it.

1733
01:39:39.101 --> 01:39:41.580
And while you're doing,
you probably can't believe when you're alone.

1734
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.950
They shut that door.
Good evening,
Mr President,
have a good night.

1735
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:47.850
They shut that door and you're alone in the oval office,
like get the fuck.

1736
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.200
But it started before that.

1737
01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:54.890
I was reading this amazing article recently about like Hillary Clinton and the

1738
01:39:55.171 --> 01:39:58.410
Clinton presidency and the lead up to the Clinton presidency and it was like,

1739
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.250
they have been implicated in murders.

1740
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.940
They've been implicated in,
they were there,

1741
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:09.300
was pushed for impeachment sex with men,
sex with women,

1742
01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:14.160
uh,
you know,
scandals,
uh,
over millions of dollars.
And you're like,

1743
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:19.320
that's how it's a card shit.
Well,
who knows?
It's true,
but you know what it is.

1744
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:23.340
It doesn't matter if it's true because perception is reality.
But what,

1745
01:40:23.341 --> 01:40:27.150
what is true is there's a fucking PR war with,

1746
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:31.690
with all those.
What's the,
what's the thing on a,
on a house of cards?
The A,

1747
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.380
I haven't watched that show.
I just watched the first episode.

1748
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.480
It's so fucking good.
Don't feel good boiler.
But anyway,
all the,

1749
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:40.760
all this sort of PR shit that goes on.
Oh,

1750
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:42.750
if you fuck with me and don't vote for this,

1751
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:46.500
I'm going to PR attack you and I'm going to get my soup back to attack you on

1752
01:40:46.501 --> 01:40:49.520
this shit.
And I'm going to do this whenever tech.
And,
and the thing is,

1753
01:40:49.521 --> 01:40:53.650
is what's interesting is they're taking real life shit that's happening in

1754
01:40:53.651 --> 01:40:56.620
American politics and they put it into like a thing that we can understand.

1755
01:40:58.090 --> 01:41:03.010
I love it.
I don't like a lot of the,
the gay socks.
No,

1756
01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:07.780
that I love.
No,
the tricky sort of directorial chicks.

1757
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:12.760
But what I do love is taking real life shit and saying,
here's,

1758
01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:15.340
here's what's actually happening and we're going to put it into a drum.

1759
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.190
And it's actually like Shakespeare.
It's like Macbeth or something.

1760
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:23.170
And we're watching our own politics as a play and it's insane.

1761
01:41:23.171 --> 01:41:26.080
And when you read actually what,
what they,
what they've been through,

1762
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:29.820
what they've done.
And by the way,
what's good for the goose is good for them.

1763
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.610
They're not fucking,
they're not,
they're not blaming

1764
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.490
<v 1>less.
Of course,
there's no one's playing on no one's blameless.
No.
Right.</v>

1765
01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:42.250
No everybody,
no Aryans Green party.
100%

1766
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:45.920
<v 5>they're all freaks.
And by the way,
if you're running for politics,
you're a freak.</v>

1767
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:47.850
<v 1>Full Stop.
Well,
that's,</v>

1768
01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.560
I think also one of the reasons why nobody wants to get behind the Clintons.

1769
01:41:50.561 --> 01:41:55.300
As you start looking into their past,
the Whitewater stuff and Whitewater,

1770
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.970
is that the right name?
Is that the right term?
I don't know,

1771
01:41:57.971 --> 01:42:00.640
but I know what you mean when you say it.
Watergate.
Yeah.

1772
01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:02.870
Whitewater Watergate was Nixon white one.

1773
01:42:02.871 --> 01:42:05.220
I get the two of them confused sometimes,
but um,

1774
01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.080
did you ever read this strange death of Vince foster?
No,

1775
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:12.220
but I read about the fact that they were implicated in a,
in a death.
Yeah.

1776
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:14.920
The strange death of Vince foster.
What are you doing over there?

1777
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.910
Death of Vince foster.
I might have very interesting,

1778
01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:22.140
a very interesting book that I read.
A,

1779
01:42:22.141 --> 01:42:26.020
I really have to go back and reread it because I haven't read it in a long time,

1780
01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.860
but a,
it's an investigation of um,
this guy,

1781
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:34.861
Vince foster and Vince foster worked with the Clintons and it tied bill and

1782
01:42:35.651 --> 01:42:38.620
Hillary Clinton to the alleged events and foster.

1783
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:42.280
And what's really interesting about this,
for sure,

1784
01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:46.000
this fucking guy for sure was moved.

1785
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.600
They found his body gun in the hand,
which you never find a suicide.

1786
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:53.290
The gun has never in your hand when you commit suicide,
when you commit suicide,

1787
01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.530
boom,
the gun goes flying,
your fucking body spasms.

1788
01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.100
This gun was like stuck to his thumb.
Like they're,
you know,
Susan,

1789
01:43:01.101 --> 01:43:04.090
the thing and his body aside,
murders,

1790
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.670
<v 5>this is how's the car?
I'm not going to fuck with you on it,</v>

1791
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:11.960
but we got to stop talking about cause it's House the card shit.

1792
01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.820
Well I want to watch that show is pretty,
but you know,
it's about that shit.

1793
01:43:16.821 --> 01:43:20.990
It's about like they're involved in some seriously and you're like watching this

1794
01:43:20.991 --> 01:43:24.350
thing saying it's like Shakespeare and it's like whatever.
Like it's a,

1795
01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:28.730
it's a it Hollywood.
And then you read actually what happened and you go,

1796
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:31.760
oh fuck.
Like that's,
there's some truth to that.

1797
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:36.920
<v 1>The only problem with this,
it's I think a lot of it was compiled,
uh,</v>

1798
01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:40.280
Kenneth Starr's investigate other same Kenneth Starr's investigation was part of

1799
01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:43.400
the conspiracy star was a patsy for the Clintonites.

1800
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:45.170
And when people think about Kenneth Star,

1801
01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:49.940
they think about a guy who goes after Clinton,
right?
I mean,

1802
01:43:49.941 --> 01:43:51.320
he was part of,
what was it?

1803
01:43:51.321 --> 01:43:55.130
Wasn't he the guy that was investigating Clinton and chasing after him with

1804
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:59.930
Monica Lewinsky,
but they're calling him a patsy for the Clintons.
I don't know,

1805
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:04.880
man.
The whole,
the whole fucking thing is when you start realizing like,

1806
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:08.300
oh,
they all might all might be murderers.
There might be just par for the course,

1807
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:13.370
just like these people.
Anyone just think of this.
Anyone who's willing to say,

1808
01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:17.210
yes,
we should go to war on some shaky grounds.
You're a murderer.

1809
01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:19.720
<v 4>But also anyone who's saying,</v>

1810
01:44:19.721 --> 01:44:24.721
I'm going to go and try to get elected and not have any bad shit from my life

1811
01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:26.980
ever come out.

1812
01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:32.450
I don't know anyone in my life that I've ever met that hasn't had some,

1813
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:33.151
<v 1>well,</v>

1814
01:44:33.151 --> 01:44:35.850
the only way you can do that is to kill people that no bad shit about you or

1815
01:44:35.851 --> 01:44:39.630
scare the fuck out of them.
So they can't come up with all that bad shit.
Exactly.

1816
01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.830
And I mean he,
they were involved in some shady real estate deals.
There was a,

1817
01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.600
first of all,
the big one is Mena Arkansas.
Do you know about all that?

1818
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:52.290
Do you know about MENA?
Arkansas is a fucking trip,
man.

1819
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:55.890
Mena Arkansas was where Barry seal,
who we work for.

1820
01:44:55.891 --> 01:45:00.090
The CIA was dropping all the cocaine that he got from South America.

1821
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:05.390
They would fly in on these fucking planes and drop packages off in Mena,

1822
01:45:05.911 --> 01:45:10.050
Arkansas and then land and they'd go pick up the packages while they drop these

1823
01:45:10.051 --> 01:45:11.400
packages.
You know,

1824
01:45:11.401 --> 01:45:15.450
the drop in fucking millions of dollars where the cocaine and these kids who

1825
01:45:15.451 --> 01:45:18.630
lived in Mena,
Arkansas,
we're hanging out on these train tracks.

1826
01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:21.840
They found these packages,
the the people,

1827
01:45:21.841 --> 01:45:24.420
whoever the fuck worked for the CIA found these kids,

1828
01:45:24.421 --> 01:45:27.480
murdered them and then laid their body on the train tracks.

1829
01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:31.190
The autopsies were done,
the kids were high,
they fell asleep on the train tracks.

1830
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.380
Parents didn't believe it.
They said,
look,
these kids didn't get high.

1831
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:36.390
This is bullshit.
So they hired an independent investigation.

1832
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:39.330
The Independent investigation finds that the kids had been murdered,

1833
01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.610
the kids had been stabbed.
Okay.

1834
01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:44.880
So that wasn't a matter of them dying from train tracks.

1835
01:45:44.881 --> 01:45:47.190
Their bodies were laid on the train.
It's postmortem.

1836
01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:51.990
So then they start digging deeper and they find out more and more shit.

1837
01:45:51.991 --> 01:45:52.651
And then this guy,

1838
01:45:52.651 --> 01:45:56.880
Barry seal gets popped and it turns out the Barry seal had been flying back and

1839
01:45:56.881 --> 01:46:00.600
forth from the fucking South American coke dealers for a RAF are,

1840
01:46:00.601 --> 01:46:03.200
hold on a second.
Is this,
he died.
See,

1841
01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:06.920
they murdered him in his car when he was on his way to testify with George Bush,

1842
01:46:06.921 --> 01:46:10.950
his phone number in his fucking pocket.
Okay.
That guy,

1843
01:46:11.370 --> 01:46:15.480
that guy literally sold drugs for the CIA,

1844
01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:20.200
like literally like testify,
gave all these accounts of the rights to this story.

1845
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:21.870
Oh,
you'll never hear it.

1846
01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:25.410
There's all these pictures of him with all these South American guys,

1847
01:46:25.411 --> 01:46:27.030
like fucking uh,
what's his name?

1848
01:46:27.031 --> 01:46:31.270
Manuel Noriega and Pablo Escobar's photos of this fucking guy with everybody.

1849
01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:36.860
They were bringing in Koch money and this is all happening in Arkansas that,

1850
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.240
that uh,
that Duh,

1851
01:46:41.610 --> 01:46:46.610
the guy who's state is bringing in fucking kazillion dollars in Koch money.

1852
01:46:48.721 --> 01:46:50.130
Every winds up.

1853
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:50.880
<v 3>First of all,</v>

1854
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.640
how the fuck do you run a shitbag state like arc and,

1855
01:46:55.641 --> 01:46:58.080
sorry,
sorry.
No offense,
Arkansas folks.

1856
01:46:58.470 --> 01:47:00.840
I'm sure there's some good spots and I'm sure you've got great barbecue,

1857
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:02.220
but let's be realistic.

1858
01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.690
How the fuck does the governor of Arkansas wind up to be the,
the,
the,

1859
01:47:06.691 --> 01:47:08.410
the king of the entire country of the month?

1860
01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.310
You got to get a lot of of money and if you had a lot of money,

1861
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:13.900
why would you be running for office in Arkansas?

1862
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:17.190
What's Arkansas and why you in or I've got a question,
what's going on?

1863
01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:21.670
If you had that much money,
our takes pieces on get,
don't get assigned,

1864
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:23.490
it takes billions of dollars.

1865
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:27.240
I don't really mean to run for president of the United States.
Billions,
billions.

1866
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:32.750
If you're,
if you have that much money or that much support,

1867
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:35.400
why the fuck would you want that Gig?

1868
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:40.900
Because I don't know any president besides Reagan,
but which by the way is uh,
uh,

1869
01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:45.720
uh,
construct.
Cause when he was in power it was a fucking disaster.
But you go,

1870
01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:50.580
okay,
like why would you want that job?
No one comes out unscathed.

1871
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:53.460
No one comes out like,
you know what?
That fucking president was awesome.

1872
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:57.080
Well Reagan,
are you going to come out on,
no,
no,
no.
He came out,
fuck he exists.

1873
01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.600
He was a dog until we said,
you know,
when he was the best one ever.

1874
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.670
But the thing is,
is you sit there and go,

1875
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:07.070
why they're going to put everything you've ever done under a microscope that

1876
01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:08.820
you've ever met is under a microscope.

1877
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:10.770
Everything you've ever said is under micro.

1878
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:14.670
Why the fuck would you want that fucking job?
Well,
not only that,
I mean that's,

1879
01:48:14.671 --> 01:48:17.400
that's certainly gotta be impossible.

1880
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:21.900
An impossible task for any normal human being,
especially a man.
Any,

1881
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:23.400
any man with a functional penis.

1882
01:48:23.610 --> 01:48:26.760
He's going to have some fucking terrible stories in his past.
But that said,

1883
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:28.200
forget about all that.

1884
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:34.370
The idea that any one person should be like that is what's most ridiculous.

1885
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.990
Exactly.
The idea that they're going to look all this stuff up and us.

1886
01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:43.050
And then there's the idea that he killed somebody.
Jk.
Just chick.

1887
01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:44.500
Yeah,
just shake her.

1888
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.670
Just the idea that one person really can run the whole kind of like,

1889
01:48:47.671 --> 01:48:52.230
we need a head guy.
Like why do we need a head guy?
Do we really still need that?

1890
01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.620
I don't know.
But what I'm saying is to get there,

1891
01:48:55.830 --> 01:49:00.540
those mother fuckers have to be shady because if you look at like George Bush

1892
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:01.374
Sr,

1893
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.820
he was like a backroom bureaucrat buddy was head of the CIA.

1894
01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:08.450
He's like our fucking Putin.
And then he,

1895
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:13.380
he gets in and he's just like this sort of non effectual sort of like nothing

1896
01:49:13.381 --> 01:49:15.180
fucking dude.
But he's like,

1897
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:19.710
he's like the head of the fucking CIA and you sit there and he'd just go,

1898
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.040
I don't even know what the fuck's happening here anymore.

1899
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.140
I don't know what you're writing over there.

1900
01:49:25.170 --> 01:49:27.600
What happens if president's become like tuna?

1901
01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.400
Like we get to the point where nobody wants to be president.

1902
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.810
I don't want to be like fuck this point where there's like literally no one

1903
01:49:36.811 --> 01:49:37.740
running for president.

1904
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:42.030
We have the presidential elections today and everybody's like,
cause people,

1905
01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:45.690
whenever I do like political pieces of shit,
they're like,
you should by the way,

1906
01:49:45.691 --> 01:49:48.340
I've seen it with you too.
Like on Twitter and shit.
They're like,

1907
01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:50.440
you should run for office.
You guys should run for office.

1908
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:53.290
Usually Joe Rogan for president,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And you're like,

1909
01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.830
are you fucking crazy?
Well,
not only that,
forget about fucking crease.

1910
01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:00.040
What kind of a fucking stressful job?

1911
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:04.150
Even if you were the most perfect Yoda,

1912
01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:09.150
Buddha Angel that made it to age 45 and never did a crime and never smoked a

1913
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:13.690
joint and never did a bump,
whatever,
you know,
even if you were,

1914
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:18.490
what kind of crazy pressure would that be to all of a sudden you're the guy

1915
01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:21.750
who's deciding whether or not military action takes place.

1916
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:26.440
You're the guy who's deciding whether or not a policy is going to be instituted

1917
01:50:26.441 --> 01:50:30.690
like Obamacare that people get up and walk that responsibility.
I don't,
dude.

1918
01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:34.870
If you make a youtube video that people don't like,
they want you to die.

1919
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.670
Could you imagine what it must feel like to be the guy who invented Obamacare?

1920
01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.460
I have personally seen people freak the fuck out,
get purple faced,

1921
01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:49.190
sweat flying off their head,
talking about the nonsense that is Obamacare.

1922
01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.250
I don't understand it.
I don't know who's right.
I don't.
I,

1923
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:55.780
I'm not a small business owner in that sense where they have a higher,
you know,

1924
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:58.540
a bunch of people and pay for their,
I don't know what's good and what's bad.

1925
01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.080
I don't know even,

1926
01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.660
I don't even understand why it was instituted in the first place.

1927
01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.040
I'm not sure I totally get it cause I've heard too many different versions of it

1928
01:51:06.041 --> 01:51:09.640
out.
I was supposed to do something.
By the way,
this is like the last week,

1929
01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.770
like you have one you guys are taking care of.

1930
01:51:11.771 --> 01:51:12.630
You don't have to worry about any of that.

1931
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:16.210
We have to like say yes or no do it because they make it seem like you're going

1932
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:19.450
to get fine if you don't get that right.
It's I think for individuals,

1933
01:51:19.451 --> 01:51:23.690
I'm not sure how it works but I know that you guys always had insurance so I

1934
01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.110
think it's essentially the same insurance.
This is essentially the same.

1935
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:28.510
I don't think,

1936
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:32.260
I don't think it's any different knows so many people are going to get fine and

1937
01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:35.060
it's going to be the most money that governments ever made.

1938
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.530
Well we don't have to get bogged down because I'll just go off for hours about

1939
01:51:41.531 --> 01:51:42.360
this.
So,

1940
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.100
but what I was just saying is that I don't think anybody should have that kind

1941
01:51:45.101 --> 01:51:45.934
of responsibility.

1942
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.970
I think any person should have the weight of the world like that on their back.

1943
01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.440
I think there has to be a better way to collectively decide what's going on.

1944
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:57.220
Then to give one guy white hair.
It's crazy.
Horror motherfuckers,
man.

1945
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.740
Nobody can do that Gig.
Here's a guy.
He's you,
man.
How old are you?

1946
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:06.100
How old are you?
44 he's just a little older than you.
That's nonsense.

1947
01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:09.650
I don't know about that because older people are even more crazy.

1948
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.230
Absolutely crazy like to say is I agree with you that we're going to vote a

1949
01:52:14.231 --> 01:52:18.850
collective me to try to make those decisions because there is no collective me.

1950
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:23.450
What I mean by he's you and he's the same age.
What I mean is it's,

1951
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:28.510
I'm just putting it into perspective that I don't feel anyone ever is the guy.

1952
01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:34.480
100% can't be done.
Okay.
It's a proposition.

1953
01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:39.520
He's going to go toe to toe with Putin over Crimea.
What does that,

1954
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:42.400
if I'm going to go toe to toe with fruit and overcome,
yeah.
I'm going to say,

1955
01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:46.190
you know what?
I lost because that guy used to run the KGB.
He's

1956
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.610
<v 5>got all the guys on the ground with all their weapons.
He's already won.</v>

1957
01:52:49.611 --> 01:52:52.500
He's got a consent.
What the fuck am I going to do?

1958
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:55.330
<v 1>Who would you stop it?
Could you imagine if they had Obama,</v>

1959
01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.190
if they did something to Obama?

1960
01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.050
Like could you imagine if something happened where like,
well,

1961
01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:05.870
you know that guy that got poisoned in,
in Russia and Ukraine,
Ukraine,

1962
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:10.780
yeah.
Face turned in this horrible,
it was horrible,

1963
01:53:10.781 --> 01:53:15.220
horrible poison.
Like the guy came very close to dot.
Well,
I don't know about all,

1964
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:18.700
but what I'm saying allegedly was brutal.

1965
01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:22.930
Could you imagine if we found out that some,
you know,
not even Putin,

1966
01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.670
some crazy person out there had it in for a mama and was actually going after

1967
01:53:27.671 --> 01:53:30.950
him.
Like,
I'm sure there's a thousand.

1968
01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:35.290
We've never had an American president assassinated by anyone in a foreign

1969
01:53:35.291 --> 01:53:35.631
country.

1970
01:53:35.631 --> 01:53:40.631
And the closest to was blaming or from a foreign country blaming Lee Harvey

1971
01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:43.840
Oswald who had gone to the Soviet Union for killing Kennedy,

1972
01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:46.420
but other guys who've killed presidents before,

1973
01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:50.020
whether it is a Abraham Lincoln or how many,

1974
01:53:50.050 --> 01:53:53.060
how many presidents have been assassinated?
Was it three?
Why are you asking me?

1975
01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.290
You don't know.
You're not even from my country.
I figure they,

1976
01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:59.670
you have to learn those things for a
dress.

1977
01:53:59.671 --> 01:54:04.540
That was either way.
I don't think anyone has ever been any of the murders.

1978
01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:08.090
Relatively small.
We're blamed on a foreign enemy.
Right.

1979
01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.990
So fascinating man.

1980
01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:15.220
The idea that there might be a new war cooking and it might be with Russia.

1981
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:19.970
<v 5>Well,
I've been saying this for a number of years.
Thank you very much.</v>

1982
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:24.740
I go to Russia and I'm like,
what the fuck's going on?

1983
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:28.760
Because I went there and I said,
I don't understand.
I don't get the politics.

1984
01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:33.810
What?
What is Putin like?
Is he calming it?
Cause the communists like him.

1985
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:38.930
Is he sort of right wing as he left wing?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He's,

1986
01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.450
he's Pro Russia and you're like,
okay,

1987
01:54:41.451 --> 01:54:43.370
I get these pro-Russian everyone's pro fucking,

1988
01:54:43.371 --> 01:54:46.460
whenever the countries did from what the fuck is his Baltic's because the

1989
01:54:46.461 --> 01:54:51.060
communist support him,
the fucking fascist supportive.
Everyone supports them and,

1990
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:54.650
and he's like,
no,
he's Pro Russia.
He's anti West.

1991
01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.000
So Pro Russia equals anti west.
And when you go there,

1992
01:54:59.001 --> 01:55:02.900
you realize these people a whole generation of more now because the new

1993
01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:06.270
generation were,
it was the Cold War.

1994
01:55:06.271 --> 01:55:09.440
It was like we on our side,
we're like,

1995
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:12.650
oh commies eat babies and you can buy a house for a pair of blue jeans.

1996
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:13.520
All that horse shit.

1997
01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.880
They grew up on all that being like American gangsters fucking,
you know.

1998
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:23.540
And so what happens is Putin comes along and just goes,
yeah,
America.
Fuck.

1999
01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:28.010
It's not our economic crisis.
It's America's economic crisis.
They fucked us up.

2000
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:30.350
It's not us being fucking new oil bitches.

2001
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.410
It's Saudi Arabia who run is run by America.

2002
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:37.070
The Cold War rhetoric in Russia never stopped.

2003
01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:38.330
That's the one thing that we never,

2004
01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:42.470
we don't realize here they are saying America is to blame for all of our shit.

2005
01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:45.690
Ever stop or did it take a break and then rekindle with Putin?

2006
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.550
It took a small break with Yeltsin and then boom,

2007
01:55:50.630 --> 01:55:53.850
this guy was hanging out.
Well,
Putin has been in like 16 years now.

2008
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:57.810
Do you remember in Yeltsin would like come over and he was hearing out,
was he,

2009
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:03.630
was he the guy that Gorbachev,
Gorbachev,
Gorbachev started it.

2010
01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:06.570
Yeltsin took over,
pushed it real fast.

2011
01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.160
Everyone loved him because he was a democracy dude.
He started all the oligarchs.

2012
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.900
Putin was head of KGB.

2013
01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:16.620
He came in and now has been basically running shit for a long time.

2014
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.360
But the interesting thing about Putin is now he's just like,
fuck you.

2015
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:24.960
I don't know if you saw the Crimean address,
but he's like,

2016
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.050
you guys put it up on us.
NATO put it up on us.

2017
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:31.800
You guys put your missile defense systems along our borders.
Fuck you.

2018
01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:34.350
Crimea's ours.
You want to go to war?
That's go.

2019
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:37.890
It's like he's been sort of training in silent,

2020
01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:41.670
like I'm going to fucking punch the punching bag and get ready and now he's

2021
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:45.200
ready to go.
And this is this whole thing in the north.
It's here,
it's Crimea.

2022
01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:48.480
He's like,
I don't give a fuck what you say.
I don't give a fuck about the west.

2023
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:52.140
I don't give a fuck about America.
I don't give a fuck about your sanctions.

2024
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:55.020
And this is why we're going back to this cold war rhetoric.

2025
01:56:55.021 --> 01:56:56.460
That's not even cold war rhetoric.

2026
01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:00.000
It's beyond cold war rhetoric cause he's like fuck you,
I don't give a shit.

2027
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:01.350
What you say now is this,

2028
01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:06.351
because he's looking out for Russia and Russia's in a bad economic situation and

2029
01:57:06.381 --> 01:57:10.740
Russia needs all that oil.
I mean oil,
they have oil,

2030
01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:14.070
they have tons of oral,
they have ties there all day.
In fact,

2031
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:17.910
all of the energy in the Ukraine is supplied by Russia.

2032
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:22.940
The majority of natural gas going into Western Europe is from Russia.

2033
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:26.390
So what's going on here?
What is the underlying motive for why?

2034
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.350
Why this is escalated?
Well,

2035
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.870
Mia has been their only fresh water port since Peter the Great.

2036
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:37.830
So that's the only place they can get to the rest of the world.

2037
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.940
And someone else ran it and they didn't like that.
The Ukraine,

2038
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:47.670
Ukraine.
If you draw a line,
the,
the,
the western part is pro Europe,

2039
01:57:47.970 --> 01:57:51.000
the eastern part is pro Russia.
So they said,
well fuck you,

2040
01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:52.380
we're just going to take it back.

2041
01:57:52.770 --> 01:57:57.090
And what happened is they did the same thing in Georgia.
They're all of the old

2042
01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:01.260
Soviet republics are,

2043
01:58:01.261 --> 01:58:05.850
they're now taking back and Crimea is,
is,
is,
has been,
they,

2044
01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:10.140
they've wanted it because it's strategically important to them for their naval

2045
01:58:10.141 --> 01:58:14.310
base,
but basically they just cut a big chunk of Europe,

2046
01:58:14.610 --> 01:58:18.840
quote unquote Europe out and said it's ours now.
And we went,

2047
01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.120
yeah,
okay.
So we just don't want to start any bolts.
We can't,
we can't,

2048
01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:26.040
nothing we can do unless we're going to go to,
what are you going to do?

2049
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:30.330
It's like saying New Jersey says they don't want to be part of fucking America.

2050
01:58:30.331 --> 01:58:35.160
So Russia moved in and we're gonna fucking right.
Right,
right.
Can't have,

2051
01:58:35.610 --> 01:58:39.120
yeah,
that would be interesting.
Yeah.
Of Russia said we can't take New Jersey.

2052
01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:42.280
Exactly.
And then,
and then by the way,

2053
01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:46.840
what are you going to do send in troops and like what is it going to take for

2054
01:58:47.110 --> 01:58:50.860
our culture to move past all of these things that are holding us back?

2055
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:53.650
Like this kind of gangster behavior that all countries do.

2056
01:58:53.730 --> 01:58:55.800
<v 1>Not just the United States,
not just Russia.</v>

2057
01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:57.990
Pretty much any country that has a lot of power.

2058
01:58:58.590 --> 01:59:01.890
They just decide like they need some resources.
They decide they need this,

2059
01:59:01.891 --> 01:59:04.770
they need that.
I mean it's,
it's always been,
what did you know?

2060
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:08.580
It's a really complicated sort of propaganda.

2061
01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:09.620
<v 5>I agree with you.</v>

2062
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:15.310
I say that the only way we have any real power is consumer advocacy.

2063
01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:19.370
What does that mean?
Whatever we buy,

2064
01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.970
that's the power because that's economics.

2065
01:59:22.971 --> 01:59:27.971
Economics runs everything and as long as Europe is buying Russian energy,

2066
01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.960
then Russia is going to say,
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want.

2067
01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:38.380
Russia is redrawing the borders of Europe with Europe's money,

2068
01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:41.720
right?
Yeah.
Cause they sell the gas to,
to Europe.

2069
01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.000
We're in the exact same position,
right.
We were sitting there saying,

2070
01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:50.720
okay,
well we're going to do this and we're going to die.
Why?

2071
01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:55.280
Because we use Google because we use fucking Facebook because we buy Nike's

2072
01:59:55.281 --> 01:59:57.380
because we buy forward.
Because whatever,

2073
01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:01.370
what's going to happen is people realize whatever I buy,

2074
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:05.600
that's the real power.
If you want.
And when I say that,

2075
02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:10.630
what I mean is if you look at pre 2008 number one sellers escalate hummer,

2076
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:17.930
you know,
all the big SUV post 2008 Prius,

2077
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.730
right?

2078
02:00:19.730 --> 02:00:24.020
Because all of a sudden gas fucking tripled in price.

2079
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:29.950
So the only thing that really moves policy is how people vote with the dollars.

2080
02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:36.730
Because if you fucking start voting with dollars with Unilever,

2081
02:00:37.911 --> 02:00:41.600
with Procter and gamble,
with Ford,
with GM,
with Exxon,

2082
02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.480
then you're going to move policy.
You could move policy decisions tomorrow,

2083
02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.960
tomorrow,
because these guys have lives to power and they say,

2084
02:00:50.961 --> 02:00:53.090
fuck these people aren't buying Fords anymore.

2085
02:00:53.091 --> 02:00:56.390
They're not buying Exxon gas or nothing.
Whatever.

2086
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:58.810
<v 1>The idea that that oil is,</v>

2087
02:00:58.811 --> 02:01:02.920
so it fluctuates so much has always been baffling to me.

2088
02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:05.800
It doesn't fluctuate that much.
But yeah,
but it,
but it fluctuates.

2089
02:01:05.801 --> 02:01:10.320
It fluctuates between profit and crazy profit.
Well,
do you remember when,
um,

2090
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:12.580
you were talking about the gas hike,

2091
02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:16.660
you remember there was right when Bush was leaving office when George W was

2092
02:01:16.661 --> 02:01:21.190
leaving office and right when he was leaving office it became like this weird

2093
02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:24.370
feeling like the,
the,
the,
the gas was sell expensive.

2094
02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:27.520
That it came like this weird feeling like people who weren't conspiracy

2095
02:01:27.521 --> 02:01:31.450
theorists were going,
wait,
wait,
are we getting fucked?
Like is he leaving?

2096
02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.820
And in the process as he just does,

2097
02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:38.470
he have like some crazy three month grace period where they just start socking

2098
02:01:38.471 --> 02:01:42.110
money out people because it just started going up and up and up and you're like,

2099
02:01:42.111 --> 02:01:46.130
well I'm sorry we have to pass on this law of loss to the consumer oils more

2100
02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:50.600
expensive these days.
Wait a minute.
What is the why is,
well,
Mark's friend said,

2101
02:01:50.601 --> 02:01:51.800
what exactly is going on?

2102
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:55.670
Why is it Cohen coincidentally coinciding with you leaving office?

2103
02:01:55.671 --> 02:01:58.520
Like we couldn't dig into that,

2104
02:01:58.521 --> 02:02:01.250
then that would be very difficult to pull off today.

2105
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:04.100
If the same situation when it was happening today,

2106
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:09.050
it would be much harder to pull off 10 years from now,
more difficult,

2107
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.290
20 years from now.
Impossible.
That's what I think.

2108
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:16.100
I think that all this creepy shit that they've been able to do and fuck people

2109
02:02:16.101 --> 02:02:19.880
over and clandestine operations like that,
I think they can't.

2110
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:22.790
It's like you can't hide it anymore.
And that's why there's some magic.

2111
02:02:22.791 --> 02:02:26.150
I was like Edward Snowden.
That's why they're so mad at guys like Julian Assange.

2112
02:02:26.151 --> 02:02:27.440
Just like those guys,

2113
02:02:27.590 --> 02:02:31.640
they broke the first holes in the dike and the water's coming through.

2114
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.400
I don't mean that kind of type.
Right?

2115
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:39.770
<v 5>If you look at it,
you say if you,
if you look at after nine 11,</v>

2116
02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.590
the Saudi royal family,
uh,

2117
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:46.970
who were living here in America were flown out.
Why?

2118
02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.350
Because whenever we have problems with,
uh,
oil prices,

2119
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:53.450
we just go to Saudi and say,

2120
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:59.170
make more and then the prices come down just because they own the most reserves,

2121
02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:04.490
the easy stuff.
The beautiful crude.
When was that?

2122
02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:08.720
What year is that?
One?
8,008 wow,
that's crazy.

2123
02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:14.390
So what happens is if we,
if we have a problem with supply,

2124
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:19.280
we go to Saudi and say,
w w what OPEC should have been,

2125
02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:22.160
which was how can we drive prices up?

2126
02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:25.910
Saudi Arabia actually de neutered because they said,
okay,

2127
02:03:25.911 --> 02:03:29.300
we're going to fucking drive prices down whenever the state say yes.

2128
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:34.810
That's what's interesting because that's why alcaide exists because we are Saudi

2129
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:42.680
Arabia's friend and we and we use them to go up and down bin Laden who comes

2130
02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:47.240
from one of the fucking richest families in Saudi Arabia said,
fuck you.

2131
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:51.080
I'm not gonna.
You know,
we're the land of Mecca Medina.

2132
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:53.870
We are the land of fucking Islamic purity.

2133
02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:57.260
We're not going to count out to the Americans.
That's where it all comes from.

2134
02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:00.560
It all comes from Saudi Arabia because of oil.

2135
02:04:00.561 --> 02:04:05.030
And because we forced them to,
to,
you know,
lower oil prices,

2136
02:04:05.031 --> 02:04:09.260
which makes us money,
which then they see it as we're in cahoots and then boom.

2137
02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.440
That's why there's a resentment when you find out about these small countries

2138
02:04:14.631 --> 02:04:19.631
that were doing terrible up until oil production and they became

2139
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:25.120
<v 1>like this most incredible magical land where everything is essentially free.</v>

2140
02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:29.310
Yeah.
I mean the amount of wealth that people in those areas

2141
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:33.550
and not crazy long period of time,

2142
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:36.850
a fairly short period of time is when you look at human history.

2143
02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:37.890
All of the sudden

2144
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.930
<v 3>history.
Yeah.
Modern culture.
Yeah.
Anything really.
Essentially one of the,</v>

2145
02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.820
Gabby,
if you fly into Abu Dabi,
which has the two largest mosques in the world,

2146
02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.120
you fly in and there's a picture from 1957 and it's a mud fort and like four

2147
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:56.970
huts and then you drive into Abu Dabi now,

2148
02:04:56.971 --> 02:05:01.971
which looks like Las Vegas on steroids in fucking 50 years.

2149
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:05.670
They've built New York.
Well,
some,

2150
02:05:05.671 --> 02:05:09.610
someone on my message board had that point.
So they were saying,
you know,
uh,

2151
02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:13.110
that I always go on and on about the pyramids.
I'm fascinated about the pyramids.

2152
02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:17.700
And some guy showed this aerial photo of Dubai and he was like,

2153
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:22.240
fuck the pyramids man.
Look how crazy this shit is.
I was like nothing.
Yeah,

2154
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.090
yeah.
50 years.
It went from zero a mud hut to yeah,
he's got a point,

2155
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.510
you know,
one one day if we ever found Dubai,
if we,
I mean what it's the,

2156
02:05:31.511 --> 02:05:35.460
the more impressive aspect of the Egyptian pyramids is we don't understand how

2157
02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:37.820
they were built.
We don't get it.
So we look at the,

2158
02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:41.340
they just the sheer size and the numbers of stones and we're like,
fuck,

2159
02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:44.640
how'd they do that?
But what happened?

2160
02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.580
What happened to the voice it pop out,

2161
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:52.170
check,
check their cost.
Um,
but the,

2162
02:05:52.171 --> 02:05:55.770
the difference between like the amount of structures they have and say like,
no,

2163
02:05:55.771 --> 02:05:59.430
that happened.
Why I felt the a,
the sound stop my ear.

2164
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:04.110
It's just the court clips.
Great.
No,
no,
it didn't get it.

2165
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.580
Don't worry.
I almost got my laptop.

2166
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:10.180
I'm a fucking fool for this paper trash right here.
Right to the right idea.

2167
02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:14.400
Um,
anyway,
where were we?

2168
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:19.830
Pyramids.
Oh yeah,
we're getting it flew over Manhattan.

2169
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.470
Manhattan was abandoned in the desert.

2170
02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:26.010
It would be like 10 times more insane than finding the pyramids because the

2171
02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:28.080
structures,
there's so many of them.

2172
02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:33.740
What I find crazy about pyramids and actually bronze age weapons is that we

2173
02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:40.020
can't build weapons like that anymore.
Like what weapons?

2174
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:44.250
There was a a thing you know was watching so therefore it has to be true because

2175
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:49.251
it was on TV about Bronze Age swords that were like,

2176
02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:52.500
it's so insanely strong cause I always thought,

2177
02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:55.560
you know they were shitty like led swords or copper swords or whatever.

2178
02:06:55.890 --> 02:06:59.580
They had bronze age armor in bronze age shorts and they would shoot like a

2179
02:06:59.581 --> 02:07:04.110
bronze age armored vest with like a modern day rifle and it wouldn't,

2180
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:06.150
it couldn't,
it couldn't penetrate it.

2181
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:10.830
And I was like how the fuck is that even possible?
That sounds like nonsense.

2182
02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:11.940
No it isn't nonsense.

2183
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.520
And swords that are like still bronze age swords that can cut through like

2184
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:22.740
crazy.
I see.
It sounds like nonsense.
Now that I say,
can you do me a favor?

2185
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:25.580
You're just laughing right up.
Can you do me a favor?

2186
02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:30.620
Look up bronze age armor slash bronze age weaponry.

2187
02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:34.420
That's just nonsense on,
well hold on.

2188
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:38.890
Fetish tell until fucking I get verification.
I'm not,

2189
02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:44.650
well they certainly spent a lot of time making weapons back then that you know,

2190
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.770
that they,
uh,
I mean they didn't spend,

2191
02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:51.250
I don't know how we've devolved into fighting over bronze age weaponry.

2192
02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:56.590
I was definitely not my number one,
the sphere of expertise.

2193
02:07:56.650 --> 02:07:57.890
How much time do you think it must have?

2194
02:07:57.910 --> 02:08:01.630
They must have spent like building a Samurai sword.
All the times.
Lines.
Yeah,

2195
02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:05.590
because
what I was about to bring it up with you,
is

2196
02:08:07.770 --> 02:08:10.430
this what you want right here,
right.
Bronze Age sort.

2197
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:11.970
But what I want you to do is,

2198
02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:16.570
is there's gotta be an article about Bronze Age weaponry being more

2199
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:20.700
sophisticated than modern day weapon.
That's silly.
How's that?

2200
02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:24.500
Guns and shit.
Yeah,
exactly.
Hmm.

2201
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:28.950
Well maybe with our modern day bronze cause we figured out bronze cost suck.

2202
02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.290
Well,
correct.
Moved on some better shit.
There's,

2203
02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:34.840
but there's a thing about like Bronze Age,

2204
02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:38.690
<v 6>uh,
armor.
Okay.</v>

2205
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:41.560
<v 3>What is the thing that it's super strong.</v>

2206
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.810
I don't want to get too far off on this because I'm not,
I just,

2207
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:50.260
I read a thing about it.
That's all.
Well,

2208
02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.210
I believe that they certainly had some knowledge flows and swords and there's a

2209
02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:57.970
lot of weapons that they constructed back then that were pretty advanced.

2210
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.680
You know,
they figured out some shit.

2211
02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:05.550
I had to think that we were gonna.
I was gonna fucking bring it up out of Boston.

2212
02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:07.230
I've had a few ales.

2213
02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:12.260
This is the problem with the end of our God damn snow problems are podcasts is

2214
02:09:12.841 --> 02:09:13.560
I'm now,
I'm fine.

2215
02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:16.920
<v 1>And what do you guys think about the uh,
the pastor that recently died?
They,</v>

2216
02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:18.740
that guy that,
oh,
all the gate.
Right?

2217
02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:24.480
Do you think that it's a d the gays and everyone should like attack his funeral?

2218
02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:29.560
Why or do you think they should show the fire ground or take the higher ground?

2219
02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:31.780
What do you,
what do you think?
That's a ridiculous question.

2220
02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:33.880
Of course he shouldn't attack his funeral.
We should ignore that.

2221
02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:38.230
It might shock their whole family and their phone call to be like,
Oh shit,

2222
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:41.660
now I see what you're talking about.
That's fucked up.
No,
no,
we're HIPAA.

2223
02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:45.220
You'd be a hypocrite.
And also you're not going to shock their family.

2224
02:09:45.221 --> 02:09:46.540
Their family was under the,
the,

2225
02:09:46.541 --> 02:09:50.140
like they were under the reign of a dictator or like a religious dictator,

2226
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:51.183
an old cunt.

2227
02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.580
He was an old crazy asshole who screamed at people and scared the fuck out of

2228
02:09:54.581 --> 02:09:59.230
them and had them all believing that his way was the only way God hates fags
guy.

2229
02:09:59.270 --> 02:10:02.200
Right.
He's got it holds up to science.
Okay.
He's just a crazy old

2230
02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:06.280
<v 3>dude that's all a house of cards and I don't know this</v>

2231
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:10.150
Westboro Baptist church,
it's pretty bad.

2232
02:10:10.230 --> 02:10:13.830
I'm going to put up my hand because I know we wrote a lot of stuff about it for

2233
02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:17.670
advice,
but I have,
I'm not,
I don't know shit about it.

2234
02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:21.650
<v 1>Um,
anyway,
the bottom line is that the guy was an asshole.
Now he's dead.</v>

2235
02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:26.780
It's just,
it's unfortunate that people get roped into that sort of a hateful

2236
02:10:26.781 --> 02:10:27.614
organizationally,

2237
02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.840
<v 3>you know,
my whole thing is it takes all sorts.</v>

2238
02:10:30.841 --> 02:10:34.920
I don't know what you do over in your compound and I don't know what,
yeah,

2239
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:39.050
because this guy would go out and attack people who would go out and they would,

2240
02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:40.400
you know,
protest funerals.

2241
02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:44.620
I get what I'm saying is he was going out there being a bad guy.

2242
02:10:44.621 --> 02:10:45.454
I'm saying I don't,

2243
02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:50.980
I don't try to look at my neighbors next door yard and oh like he was doing or

2244
02:10:51.630 --> 02:10:55.430
saying or anybody does.
Yeah,
well you know what man,

2245
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:59.900
it's just sad when people get people or some people are like easily led and

2246
02:10:59.901 --> 02:11:04.690
instead of finding some,
you know,
nice religious leaders,

2247
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:07.940
you'll put together a nice community and they all have picnics and shit.

2248
02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:11.250
If they found an asshole,
I mean that's really essentially what happened.

2249
02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:16.130
They got roped into some shitheads gravity and a and now he's dead.

2250
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:20.360
Yeah,
they definitely shouldn't protest this funeral man.
Just just,
you know he's,

2251
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:24.890
he's a lesson.
You're just trying to start shit legit question.

2252
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:27.540
I believe in dynamic fasteners and all that.

2253
02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:32.090
Karma hype like positive stuff dynamic faster.

2254
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:35.990
I just think that,
what are you talking about?
People they want faster.

2255
02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:37.510
He blew a point.
Oh what is it?

2256
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:41.930
Dynamic fastener or something that that he's like a huge sponsor for all these

2257
02:11:41.931 --> 02:11:45.080
UFC fighters.
Right,
but what is it?
[inaudible] it's just a part,

2258
02:11:45.081 --> 02:11:46.730
it's like screws and bolts.

2259
02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:50.170
But this guy's just a big UFC fan and he just pays for all these.
Right.

2260
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:51.180
But it's just like,

2261
02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:53.510
just say that no one's gonna know what the fuck you're talking about.

2262
02:11:53.690 --> 02:11:56.100
I didn't know what you're talking about.
I mean I've seen the ads but I didn't,

2263
02:11:56.101 --> 02:11:59.540
I had no idea what your case.
I don't know what,
I never,

2264
02:11:59.790 --> 02:12:01.160
I never looked into what that was.

2265
02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.060
It's really interesting because the guy's just a fan and then you realize it's

2266
02:12:05.061 --> 02:12:08.450
not that expensive to be a sponsor for one of these fighters.

2267
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:09.890
So this guy that just owns like,

2268
02:12:09.891 --> 02:12:14.180
I like this part co guy and he's just a fan said now everyone was like coming

2269
02:12:14.181 --> 02:12:18.260
out in shirts with like this is dynamic fastener on it and it's just like

2270
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:19.730
nothing.
It's nothing that

2271
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.150
ego does that to a technologies guy does that.
I asked him once and was like,
why?

2272
02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.760
Why do you advertise field?
So I just log it like seeing,

2273
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:35.180
I think it was like the real world or something and it was like the biggest show

2274
02:12:35.181 --> 02:12:36.260
on TV at the time.

2275
02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:40.010
And it would show at like three in the morning when most people would get home

2276
02:12:40.011 --> 02:12:43.910
in New York.
And there was the guy that Brooklyn clown,
it's Brooklyn clown.

2277
02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.930
He was a clown,
but it would be like the number one show on TV.

2278
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:51.470
But people would come home at like three in the morning and he was a clown who

2279
02:12:51.471 --> 02:12:56.471
would buy like the advertising spots for like a grand and so it was this huge

2280
02:12:57.921 --> 02:13:00.260
show that millions of people would watch.

2281
02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:04.690
But all the advertising would be about the Brooklyn town.
Huh?

2282
02:13:05.090 --> 02:13:07.820
It's actually really cheap to get advertising in late at night.

2283
02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:10.190
That's what I was trying to get.
Like Tito's Tacos.
Seriously.

2284
02:13:10.191 --> 02:13:13.750
You know how many of you were saying you were saying the the fastener can,

2285
02:13:13.751 --> 02:13:15.230
I can get,
get in there and get the thing.

2286
02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:18.500
This guy was super smart cause he's like,

2287
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:23.520
oh here's this time slot that everyone's getting home to watch the real world or

2288
02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:25.610
whatever.
Some big show.
Wow.
Where does it,

2289
02:13:25.611 --> 02:13:28.370
when they give away their whole channel,
how can they have a fake show?

2290
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.740
There you go.
That's the weirdest shit ever.
You're like,
am I Montel Williams?

2291
02:13:31.741 --> 02:13:35.670
Is this a real show?
Montel,
what's going on here?
Merging 30 years.

2292
02:13:35.671 --> 02:13:39.420
He got right in judo.
No.
10 he got 10 years ago.
10 only.
Yeah.

2293
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:41.580
Have you done a mirror?
No,

2294
02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:44.570
cause I wouldn't have mine that would never have that guy on like,

2295
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.640
well because I watch,

2296
02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:49.180
<v 1>it's a lot of those were swindler I met him.
He's a nice guy.</v>

2297
02:13:49.181 --> 02:13:51.290
I met him because he um,
yeah,

2298
02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:55.960
he put a bunch of money into something called the Ip t was the international

2299
02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:59.290
pool tour and uh,
he um,

2300
02:13:59.350 --> 02:14:02.410
he put on these gigantic events in Vegas.

2301
02:14:02.411 --> 02:14:06.850
Like the most money people ever got paid from professional pool was Kevin

2302
02:14:06.850 --> 02:14:07.900
Trudeau.
Yup.

2303
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:11.920
And he put together a television show and he was going to have these guys play

2304
02:14:11.921 --> 02:14:16.240
and it was on television and they were playing pool for hundreds of thousands of

2305
02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.380
dollars.
They,
they had done it full blast.
Like he put the pedal to the metal,

2306
02:14:20.381 --> 02:14:22.800
spent millions of bucks that he'd robbed from little old ladies,

2307
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:26.430
thought they were going to lose weight secrets they don't want you to know
about.

2308
02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:32.800
But he spent all this money under the premise that there was laws that,

2309
02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:36.770
um,
that hadn't been instituted yet.
Um,
they didn't,

2310
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.900
they didn't know that they existed.

2311
02:14:37.930 --> 02:14:42.190
They were going to ride them about Internet gambling.
So when they made these,

2312
02:14:42.250 --> 02:14:43.630
when they made the business model,

2313
02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:46.960
they factored in internet gambling people be able to gamble on these pool

2314
02:14:46.961 --> 02:14:50.420
matches and will profit from that.
And then there'll be residual.

2315
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:54.790
I have a bunch of gambling junkies associate are our site with a good place to

2316
02:14:54.791 --> 02:14:58.110
gamble.
You know,
because there was all these online gambling,
poker players,

2317
02:14:58.150 --> 02:15:00.550
all those people that got arrested and had to move to Costa Rica.
Yeah,

2318
02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:03.040
well this was all part of that.
Okay.

2319
02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.360
So when they came in and shut down online gambling,
he was fucked.

2320
02:15:07.450 --> 02:15:11.370
So he lost shitloads of money.
Oh,

2321
02:15:11.610 --> 02:15:16.210
I'm spilled again.
How to give people their money back.
Had to,

2322
02:15:17.230 --> 02:15:21.340
had to pay off these pool players and like fractions on the dollar.
I mean,

2323
02:15:21.341 --> 02:15:24.070
I don't know what the fraction was.
It was 75 cents on a dollar.

2324
02:15:24.071 --> 02:15:28.060
Or if some of them got paid all their money,
but he didn't pay all of them.

2325
02:15:28.061 --> 02:15:30.040
I don't know.
Maybe they all got paid eventually,

2326
02:15:30.041 --> 02:15:33.280
but it's a long struggle you're talking about,
right.
So this guy,

2327
02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:35.750
interesting shit.
So then,
um,
you know,

2328
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:38.890
the pool takes this big fucking slide afterwards,

2329
02:15:38.891 --> 02:15:43.270
but everybody sorta hopes and prays that this guy gets his shit together and

2330
02:15:43.271 --> 02:15:47.260
comes back to pool.
He's like the savior,
a pool that's fucking crazy.

2331
02:15:47.261 --> 02:15:50.420
Guy Rips off all ladies.
I actually want it

2332
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:54.640
<v 3>do that story is a movie that's the most fascinating cause he,</v>

2333
02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.380
he did this pool thing,

2334
02:15:56.710 --> 02:15:59.430
blew up in his face and he said I'm going to cure cancer with no,
no.

2335
02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:03.730
He always had the nonsense.
The nonsense was always there.
He always had nonsense.

2336
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.670
He is the nonsense to make his money.
Cause I,

2337
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:08.500
I get home at like four in the morning,

2338
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:13.360
so I watch late night infomercials and I'm,
I'm a,

2339
02:16:13.361 --> 02:16:18.160
I'm weak at that.
Our strongest,

2340
02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:21.310
no,
no,
I'm not the strongest mentally.
Oh,
I see.
I see.

2341
02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:23.710
I don't know why that came up.

2342
02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.930
We totally let down a dark road because the one of these hiccups,
you're wasted.

2343
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:31.630
Right.
And you,
and he's going,
you know what?

2344
02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:37.090
It's fucking powdered asparagus.
That's what's going to do it.

2345
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:40.290
I'm like,
you know what?
I'm in coral calcium.
Remember

2346
02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:45.150
coral cow?
That was the one that was the one that you got to know.

2347
02:16:45.210 --> 02:16:49.380
It's coral counseling.
He's Japanese people that I would have fucking dead.

2348
02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:54.280
I would've put it in my eyeballs.
Yeah.
Cause it's four 30 in the morning.
Yeah.

2349
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:57.190
You're ready to go.
You're like,
fuck,
I want coral calcium.

2350
02:16:57.250 --> 02:17:01.000
It seems like what's something that's missing in my life?
Yeah.
I need that.
Yeah.

2351
02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:04.240
When it's really late at night,
you're like,
you're convinced he got fuck though.

2352
02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:08.680
Yeah.
10 years is a long ass time.
And uh,
you know,
he had done some time already,

2353
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:10.090
had done like a few months.

2354
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:14.350
They tried to tell the judge that he's changed his ways,
get,
you know,

2355
02:17:14.351 --> 02:17:19.160
we got to do his,
we got a wolf of Wall Street.
That shit.
Well,
you know,
I have a,

2356
02:17:19.161 --> 02:17:23.830
a good friend who worked for him for years.
Fuck off.
Yeah.
Let's make that.

2357
02:17:23.890 --> 02:17:25.740
If you want it,
you gotta do it right now.
I don't know.

2358
02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:28.990
Everybody we want to do the movie stopped.

2359
02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:31.420
I don't know if my friends signed the NDA,

2360
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:36.230
so I have to be careful about Trudeau doesn't get out of jail and throw heat at

2361
02:17:36.231 --> 02:17:39.460
them.
He might fucking escape.
Even if he told the story.
Truthfully though,

2362
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:41.020
the store would be Shawshank door.

2363
02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:44.550
The truthful story is actually quite fascinating.
You know,
the,

2364
02:17:44.551 --> 02:17:49.551
the actual truthful story of him spending all that money on pool fucking brain

2365
02:17:50.341 --> 02:17:53.440
acts because pool players or a fuck a bunch of maniacs,

2366
02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.330
crazy guys out there scrambling and hustling and wearing fucking wearing

2367
02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.960
overalls and pretending they just hopped off a farm.
Just anybody who,

2368
02:18:01.961 --> 02:18:06.670
I don't know.
Yeah,
I mean that's what half of those guys grew up doing.

2369
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:09.920
You know?
That's how for those guys,
that's where they get their,
uh,

2370
02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:12.300
that's where they get their experience,
you know?

2371
02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.610
And so all of a sudden they're wearing tuxedos and they're playing on TV.

2372
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:18.070
And it was one of those weird TV channels too.

2373
02:18:18.071 --> 02:18:21.690
It was like it was on one of those burgeoning,
we have to make a movie.

2374
02:18:21.710 --> 02:18:24.670
This fucker.
It's interesting stuff man.
They were good events too.

2375
02:18:24.671 --> 02:18:26.650
He really taught us players in the world.

2376
02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:31.240
It's also like a global news event that this fucker got like 10 years.
Yeah.

2377
02:18:31.510 --> 02:18:35.710
So anyway.
Oh boy.
Shouldn't talk about it anymore.
But we should make this fuck.

2378
02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:38.710
Listen man,
you should make the movie and I'll tell you what the story,

2379
02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:40.940
I'll connect you to people and I'm awesome movies,
man.

2380
02:18:40.941 --> 02:18:45.510
I ain't got no time for that.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
Um,

2381
02:18:45.610 --> 02:18:49.360
that uh,
that story is kind of unique though.
It's any unique.
Also,

2382
02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:52.810
day off school is a tragic fucking game.

2383
02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:57.040
It's a tragically a haunted game and I'm not exactly sure why.

2384
02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:02.150
It seems like somewhere along the line pool,
fuck somebody over and well,

2385
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:04.660
it's first of all,
it didn't fuck anyone over.

2386
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:09.870
It's a barroom game that you bet your pitcher money on [inaudible] and all of a

2387
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:16.141
sudden it was like legitimate because of a awful but amazing Tom cruise movie.

2388
02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.220
And then you're like,
why isn't it Nuka?
Well,

2389
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:24.550
it was way bigger.
You know,

2390
02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.580
before the Tom Cruise movie in the 19 hundreds it turn of the century,

2391
02:19:28.581 --> 02:19:31.040
there was a thousand,
no,
no pool.

2392
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:35.450
There was a thousand pool halls in New York City at the turn of the century.

2393
02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:39.920
Pool was huge.
And know the term pool doesn't mean pocket billiards.

2394
02:19:39.921 --> 02:19:41.570
Pocket billiards is the game,
right?

2395
02:19:41.571 --> 02:19:45.260
The term pool is gathering up all your money and betting it,

2396
02:19:45.261 --> 02:19:48.050
pooling your money together and betting it on games.

2397
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:50.990
So pool was the name pool.
In fact,

2398
02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:55.070
it was inherently connected to this derelict bachelor lifestyle.

2399
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.370
Why?
Cause I got you on the subject.

2400
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.120
The only thing that you know,

2401
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:05.780
like he knows more about [inaudible] except for pool.

2402
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:08.120
Well there's a lot of people know a lot more about pool than I do,

2403
02:20:08.121 --> 02:20:13.030
but I know enough.
I know enough.
In 1962 is when it became really famous though.

2404
02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.850
It was the hustler,
a hustler.
The motherfucking Gleason.
That's a fair play.

2405
02:20:16.851 --> 02:20:20.080
His ass off.
Jack [inaudible] really good for real.
Paul Newman was making,

2406
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:24.800
he paid,
he played uh,
Minnesota fats.
And then,
and then,

2407
02:20:24.890 --> 02:20:28.910
uh,
Paul Newman lost to but then B,
I was thinking about that.

2408
02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:33.980
I can't be beat tonight.
That just that line.
Cause I was,
I was on a roll.

2409
02:20:34.010 --> 02:20:37.940
I was fucking people's Shit,
whatever it,
I was like,
I can't be beat tonight.

2410
02:20:37.941 --> 02:20:42.590
And I was like,
where's that from?
This is my table man.
I own it.

2411
02:20:43.050 --> 02:20:46.880
Be Paul Newman.
Paul Newman couldn't play a lick,

2412
02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:50.330
but they knew it was terrible.
But you could tell he couldn't really play.

2413
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:54.590
It was offensive to a real pool player.
He watches goofy stroke and shots of,

2414
02:20:54.591 --> 02:20:58.210
you'd mentioned chat out of here with that fucking combination bank shot.
That's,

2415
02:20:58.211 --> 02:21:01.700
that's,
that's nonsense.
Hope today shoots that shot.
So you're going to say that.

2416
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:06.370
What about Tom Cruise?
He could play.
Really?
Yeah.
Tom Cruise.
Fuck off.

2417
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:08.600
He apprenticed with Mike Segal,
Mike Segal,

2418
02:21:08.601 --> 02:21:12.440
who's a multiple time world champion and also was a lefty like Tom Cruise.

2419
02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:15.920
Mike Segal,
who was a friend of mine,
brilliant pool player,

2420
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:17.840
like literally one of the greatest of all time.

2421
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:22.060
And he mentor Tom Cruise has taught him [inaudible] Tom Cruise is a maniac.

2422
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:26.390
He fucking took that dude and he taught him how to play and he looks like a pool

2423
02:21:26.391 --> 02:21:28.820
player.
It doesn't look like a great pool player.

2424
02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:33.770
There's a fluidity of my really good at something.
I have an open bridge,

2425
02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:36.530
so I'm going to tell a true story.
When I was a young kid,

2426
02:21:36.531 --> 02:21:40.280
there's a lot of pool playing in,
in a Muncho like for money.

2427
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:45.910
And I had a girlfriend who was a girl and she would grow in a friend and she was

2428
02:21:46.581 --> 02:21:50.600
a fantastic pool player.
Huh.
So she would win.
But she was like,

2429
02:21:50.601 --> 02:21:55.010
if you ever see anyone who has an open bridge,
you've won.

2430
02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:59.730
That was the whole thing.
Like,
all right.
And so Paul Newman as an open Brit.

2431
02:22:00.170 --> 02:22:03.500
Well that does,
that's not really correct.
There's a lot of really great players.

2432
02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:05.360
Rob Cya is one of the best in the world.

2433
02:22:05.361 --> 02:22:08.940
I'll plays almost exclusively with an open bridge.
Very rarely closest bridge.

2434
02:22:08.941 --> 02:22:11.870
She just prefers to cite the queue that way.
And once you get really good,

2435
02:22:11.871 --> 02:22:15.560
it doesn't matter.
There's certain shots where some guys prefer close bridge,

2436
02:22:15.561 --> 02:22:18.530
but there's some great snooker players that never closed their bridge.

2437
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:21.460
All the guys that came over from snuck her sneakers all done with an open bridge

2438
02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:25.860
and they have the best fundamentals out of almost any cool so far in the fucking

2439
02:22:25.861 --> 02:22:29.900
pockets.
Tiny pockets,
tiny balls,
precise card.

2440
02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:33.720
So the mechanics have to be absolutely perfect.
So snooker players have,

2441
02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:37.740
are you a better fighter,
a pool player?
This point in my life,

2442
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:41.960
but I suck at both at this point where I ever get both.
No,

2443
02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:46.410
I suck at book.
You're like,
what?
Are you leaning fine?
You know,
like five times?

2444
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:51.330
No,
no,
no.
Taekwondo champion.
A state championship.
I won four years in a row,

2445
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.440
but that was 98819891999 or whenever it was [inaudible] 85 to 88 so you're one

2446
02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:04.090
of the best
lovers,

2447
02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:07.030
taekwondo guys.
I know how to drive you better.

2448
02:23:07.031 --> 02:23:08.890
Are you better at cooler taekwondo?
Come on.

2449
02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:12.430
I was definitely better at talking window.
Okay.
Yeah,
I was way better.

2450
02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:16.410
I pool a pool.
I got marginal at best a pool.
I'm a decent,
what do you call it?

2451
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:20.610
Beat player.
Did you play for money?
Yeah,
it's fun.
It's fun.

2452
02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:23.590
You know I'm not good enough to beat anybody.
That's actually good.

2453
02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:27.640
Pool is something that you have to literally play eight hours a day.
Can you,

2454
02:23:27.641 --> 02:23:29.410
can you win right off the rack?

2455
02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:32.920
<v 1>What do you mean?
Can I run out?
Yeah,
I can run out.
I just not that consistent.</v>

2456
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.160
Right.
I can break and run out but I might not do it the next game.

2457
02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:39.520
I might miss it.
You really need to like put in the numbers,

2458
02:23:39.521 --> 02:23:41.830
the hours because what you're doing when you're playing,

2459
02:23:41.831 --> 02:23:44.350
when you get really good is you,

2460
02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:49.380
you are so in tuned with the amount of effort that it takes to knock your stick

2461
02:23:49.481 --> 02:23:54.481
into this ball that you're literally counting the revolutions with field that

2462
02:23:54.561 --> 02:23:55.630
the ball's going to make.

2463
02:23:56.350 --> 02:24:01.350
It's like archery and a lot of ways and in that when you're actually executing,

2464
02:24:02.381 --> 02:24:07.381
it requires absolute complete concentration and there's something that's very

2465
02:24:07.931 --> 02:24:12.400
attractive to me about anything that requires absolute complete concentration.

2466
02:24:12.401 --> 02:24:15.190
Whether it's martial arts,
whether it's pool,
weather,
it's archery.

2467
02:24:15.610 --> 02:24:17.590
I think there's something deeper that's going on.

2468
02:24:17.591 --> 02:24:21.500
I think my brain is recognizing that it needs,
it needs some fixing.

2469
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:22.600
<v 3>10th stimulation.</v>

2470
02:24:22.810 --> 02:24:26.860
The Hustler and color of money is when they're going,

2471
02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:30.370
there's a rhythm [inaudible] they're just popping.
Yeah,
he was doing it.

2472
02:24:30.730 --> 02:24:35.710
And when they're not,
they're like,
oh,
I'm hitting shots.
Right?
But when he's gone,

2473
02:24:35.711 --> 02:24:37.530
he's like,
I can't be beat,
motherfucker.

2474
02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:37.751
<v 1>Well,</v>

2475
02:24:37.751 --> 02:24:41.380
did you ever see there's a scene in the hustler where he plays this guy or a,

2476
02:24:41.381 --> 02:24:44.300
in the color of money we placed this Guy Greati Stevens,

2477
02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:48.810
remember that there's a shoot out.
It's only worth that guy.
That's only,

2478
02:24:48.811 --> 02:24:51.880
it only gets worse.
I wasn't that guy.
He's one of the best pool player,

2479
02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:54.790
especially money players.
That's Keith McCready,
right?

2480
02:24:54.850 --> 02:24:57.420
He's a real legit big money player.
Right.

2481
02:24:57.490 --> 02:25:01.810
And he was a real unique player because he started playing so young that he

2482
02:25:01.811 --> 02:25:04.780
couldn't reach over the table.
So he started playing with his arm,

2483
02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:08.200
cocked out to the side,
and he stuck with that forever.

2484
02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:12.220
And he was just a world beater,
this guy.
And that's what he used to do.

2485
02:25:12.221 --> 02:25:15.610
He used to walk in a pool halls with a shirt that said the world gets the eight.

2486
02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:19.360
You know what that means?
That means he spots you in a game,
a nine ball.

2487
02:25:19.361 --> 02:25:21.220
He spots you the eight ball.
That means you win the,

2488
02:25:21.370 --> 02:25:24.040
if you get the eight ball in or the nine he wins only with

2489
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.940
<v 2>a nine ball.
So he's given professional players.
Yeah,
an advantage.
He's like,</v>

2490
02:25:27.970 --> 02:25:30.490
that's how confident he is.
And it was a real guy.

2491
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:32.670
So like when he's playing his Grady,
Steven,

2492
02:25:32.671 --> 02:25:35.530
it's like to the people that know the game.
I could,
it's very,

2493
02:25:36.130 --> 02:25:39.430
it's very appropriate.
It's perfect.
You know,
that was a,

2494
02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:44.300
that movie really represented a lot of the,
the craziness that,
that,
you know,

2495
02:25:44.410 --> 02:25:46.960
gambling and pool and being on the road is

2496
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:48.910
<v 5>none of them ever got it right.
You know what,</v>

2497
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.590
I hate all like remakes and especially of classics and,

2498
02:25:53.591 --> 02:25:56.500
and the Hustler is such a great fucking film.

2499
02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.920
It was an excellent follow on of a guy who is just like sitting there in his own

2500
02:26:03.041 --> 02:26:06.790
shit.
Just [inaudible] I'm going to come back now.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
Well,

2501
02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:08.430
Walter Tevis is a,

2502
02:26:08.431 --> 02:26:12.400
a the guy who wrote both of them and he wrote the hustler and he also wrote the

2503
02:26:12.401 --> 02:26:15.430
color of money.
But the color of money,
the books,
a very different book.

2504
02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:19.300
<v 2>It's very different ending.
Very different.
It follows fast.
Eddie like on the,</v>

2505
02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.140
like he goes around by himself.
There's no fence,

2506
02:26:21.141 --> 02:26:22.730
there's no Tom cruise character in the product.

2507
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:26.990
They made the comp Tom Cruise character because they wanted to jazz it up for a,

2508
02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.410
I mean it's a good move for work.
For Pool was a huge,
huge movie.

2509
02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:35.310
<v 5>But uh,
since then video games came along,
kick pool and the deck.</v>

2510
02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:38.690
What does that book hard to follow?
I could imagine a pool book be like,

2511
02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:40.600
well that's just you though,
cause you're not in pool.

2512
02:26:40.890 --> 02:26:43.360
Meaning that they explained like the ball rolled down and you know,

2513
02:26:43.390 --> 02:26:44.580
it's not really about pool.

2514
02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:46.650
<v 2>Let's see.
That was the thing about the hustler to you.</v>

2515
02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:49.060
Did you ever see that movie?
The hustler long,
long time.

2516
02:26:49.061 --> 02:26:50.410
It's really not about pool.

2517
02:26:50.411 --> 02:26:55.390
What it's about is about a guy trying to prove that he's worth something in life

2518
02:26:55.391 --> 02:26:58.270
and fucking up and making colossal mistakes along the way.

2519
02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:03.040
It's about to romantic losers and we connect together and she's a loser,

2520
02:27:03.070 --> 02:27:04.750
takes care of it.
And it's got a limp.

2521
02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:08.260
I mean there's a lot of dark shit to this movie.
She was a drunk and you know,

2522
02:27:08.261 --> 02:27:12.550
Jackie was a drunk,
he's a drunk and Jackie Gleason drunk is a drunk,

2523
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:14.970
I mean these gamblers and,
and,

2524
02:27:14.971 --> 02:27:18.670
and fucking murderers and all these people that they were interacting with.

2525
02:27:19.210 --> 02:27:22.240
It was so much of,
it was just a character study.

2526
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:25.200
And that was the fascinating thing about that movie.
The pool playing.

2527
02:27:25.210 --> 02:27:28.120
Like I said,
it was dog shit.
Paul Newman,
luckily he couldn't make a ball.

2528
02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.420
Jackie Gleason could play,
he could read,
he could play better than all of them.

2529
02:27:31.421 --> 02:27:34.600
Better than Tom Cruise.
Better than Paul Newman.
Paul Newman,

2530
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:37.750
who was just a brilliant actor,
just didn't put the time in.

2531
02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:41.430
You would have to put a lot of time in to look like a real pool player,
you know,

2532
02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:42.250
cause there's,

2533
02:27:42.250 --> 02:27:47.250
there's like a gentleness to the stroke of a real person that is classic Jackie

2534
02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:50.650
Gleason.
It really was an amazing cat,
you know,

2535
02:27:50.651 --> 02:27:55.300
and an unabashed drinker too.
Like they would ask him like,

2536
02:27:55.301 --> 02:27:57.520
why he drinks?
He goes,
I drink to get fucked.

2537
02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:02.040
<v 5>You know what's weird about tech?
I was somewhere recently,</v>

2538
02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:06.990
I was in Ghana,
I was in again and doing this a garbage thing that we're doing.

2539
02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:11.310
And I watched this old French film,
it's a huge French film,
like successful,

2540
02:28:11.311 --> 02:28:15.480
like massive,
like cultural French from the star of the film.

2541
02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.230
Jackie Gleason.
Wow.
He doesn't say a word.

2542
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:21.620
He plays a mute.

2543
02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:27.700
<v 3>A janitor who picks up a sort of French prostitute and takes care of her and her</v>

2544
02:28:29.541 --> 02:28:30.374
young kid.

2545
02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.040
And it's this French classic film with Jackie Gleason as the star who never says

2546
02:28:37.941 --> 02:28:40.470
a fucking word.
And by the way,
it's like a,

2547
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:43.270
Burt Lancaster did the same thing with the Leopard in,

2548
02:28:43.271 --> 02:28:47.630
in Italy where I was a huge,
a successful film where he spoke in Italian.

2549
02:28:47.631 --> 02:28:48.740
He did it phonetically.

2550
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:51.650
They would just say it into his ear and he'd say the same thing,

2551
02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:55.580
but Jackie Gleason was this piece.
No,
no,
no.

2552
02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.760
They would just say like a gentle famiglia tonight and he would,

2553
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.490
and then they roll it to different meetings,
vent unit.

2554
02:29:05.930 --> 02:29:09.120
They would just say it in his ear.
You just do it phonetically.
Okay.
Okay.

2555
02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:13.970
There's no earpiece.
So he just repeated it.
Yeah.
And then,

2556
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:18.470
uh,
but Jackie Gleason has this like huge French,
like,

2557
02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:20.710
you know,
film like that.

2558
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:25.430
It's like French fucking like cultural where he's the star of it as this janitor

2559
02:29:25.431 --> 02:29:30.080
in a,
in a building.
And he didn't,
he never says a word.
When I lived in New York,

2560
02:29:30.081 --> 02:29:32.210
I had a friend,
uh,
who,

2561
02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:37.430
one of his friends knew the guy's a fucking cock odd connection,
but it was a,

2562
02:29:37.431 --> 02:29:41.330
there was,
there were all in music business,
like rock and roll guys.

2563
02:29:41.331 --> 02:29:45.620
Like one of them was in this band and he knew a dude who somehow or another new

2564
02:29:45.621 --> 02:29:49.910
salon who bought Jackie Gleason's old home and Jackie Gleason.

2565
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.200
This is the story.
Jackie Gleason is obviously third hand.

2566
02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:58.400
It could be total horseshit and that's it.
The story was,
and it's a fun story,

2567
02:29:58.430 --> 02:30:02.840
the Jackie Gleason was drinking with Nixon and him and Nixon were buddies and

2568
02:30:02.841 --> 02:30:03.291
that,
you know,

2569
02:30:03.291 --> 02:30:07.460
they're talking football and throwing back some fucking Jack and cokes and

2570
02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:10.690
Nixon's like you want to see your fucking Ufo so they can,

2571
02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:16.140
they get in the Air Force One and they flied some military base where they've

2572
02:30:16.521 --> 02:30:21.521
got a crashed flying saucer and Jackie Gleason from Dan on becomes a crazy,

2573
02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:27.220
a UFO believer and Jackie Gleason has this backyard and upstate New York and he

2574
02:30:27.531 --> 02:30:32.531
has a fake Ufo designed and built in his driveway to replicate the thing that he

2575
02:30:33.291 --> 02:30:36.770
saw.
He hires a bunch of people to try to recreate something.

2576
02:30:36.771 --> 02:30:40.280
He puts it together and his head sorta like a crime sketch,

2577
02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:44.630
like you would try to reenact it.
I want to that want to live story.

2578
02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:49.350
That's the fun.
I do believe it.
I would like to find my,

2579
02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:53.350
I did fuck up my computer.
It's not working.
Luckily I've got backups.

2580
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:58.400
Spilly makes spiller.
Yeah,
you're drunk already.
Mixed slurs.

2581
02:30:58.450 --> 02:31:00.410
Did you get that chemical that you can just put on your computer?

2582
02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.510
Probably a good idea.
Um,
all right buddy.

2583
02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:05.780
But I don't know if Jackie Gleason really did.
Why don't you Google it?

2584
02:31:05.810 --> 02:31:09.260
Find out did Jackie Gleason?
Uhh,
really,
really anyone about photos.

2585
02:31:09.370 --> 02:31:13.190
It was Jackie Gleason and the UFOS,
it'll say,
well,
Joe Rogan once said,

2586
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:18.230
I spread my own fucking,
I like the PTO isolation.
I like that story.

2587
02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:20.700
I'll make up a story not even realizing made it up.

2588
02:31:20.850 --> 02:31:24.240
Put it out there and then I'll find it on Wikipedia and I'll use it as a

2589
02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:28.600
reference to prove when I tell the story again,
trip to the alien more.

2590
02:31:29.730 --> 02:31:32.850
Wow.
So this is a real rumor to the moon,
Alice.

2591
02:31:32.851 --> 02:31:36.330
There was a time when you scroll that down,

2592
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:40.920
stop,
go back,
collaborate.
Listen,
stop right there.

2593
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:46.380
You're fucking drunk as shit,
dude.
Uh,
there was another size Jenkins,

2594
02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:47.340
extremely serious,

2595
02:31:47.341 --> 02:31:52.330
I'm sure UFO researcher and prided himself on the huge collection of [inaudible]

2596
02:31:52.380 --> 02:31:56.340
books,
which numbered into the thousands the see I call bullshit.
You know why?

2597
02:31:56.940 --> 02:32:01.020
I doubt there's thousands of books written that you have foes back up.

2598
02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:05.400
What more could you say?
Like,
Oh,
uh,
you know,
and then he saw light too.

2599
02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:10.680
As soon as a new title came out,
even in Europe or the UK,
Jackie had a copy.

2600
02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:14.310
Hmm.
Well,
I don't know if it's true.
Um,

2601
02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:18.780
but that was the store that this guy told me about the story.
It's a dope story.

2602
02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:20.461
If that's true,

2603
02:32:20.461 --> 02:32:25.210
if Jackie leasing really was some sort of a crazy UFO fanatic and that that's

2604
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:29.130
even more matching if it's fucking true.
Oh,
it's all true.

2605
02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.700
What a beautiful thing it would be if they really did have like a hanger.
Yeah.

2606
02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:36.370
You know what I want when we're old and we're sitting on the cove drinking our

2607
02:32:36.371 --> 02:32:37.120
drink,

2608
02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:41.620
looking at the water just mean you gray old silver bags and someone's going to

2609
02:32:41.621 --> 02:32:42.850
go,
you know what,

2610
02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:47.530
fucking Jackie Gleason went to area 51 and saw that shit.

2611
02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:52.490
I wonder what's going to happen.
Yeah.
I wonder.

2612
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:56.260
I wonder who will have,
I wonder if they really do have something.
I mean,

2613
02:32:56.450 --> 02:32:57.283
that would be,

2614
02:32:57.980 --> 02:33:02.840
I would wish one person who was lid legitimately intelligent who was dying,

2615
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:06.650
which spilled the beans.
I wish every dude that spills the beans,
they're like,

2616
02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:10.530
man,
fucking Weirdo.
It just,

2617
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:12.050
I'm not bye bye.

2618
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:17.060
One chive and with my one thing is how impossible would it be to keep a secret

2619
02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:22.290
today?
It would be too impossible.
You know,
one person would say something,

2620
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:24.390
I don't agree with that because they look,

2621
02:33:24.391 --> 02:33:26.880
they kept a secret when they were making the Manhattan project,

2622
02:33:27.210 --> 02:33:30.360
but that was a different era.
What one thing I will say

2623
02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:36.860
is maybe those movies and TV shows and leaks and everyone,

2624
02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:40.980
because we're all like,
oh yeah,
I already have 51 of course it's the aliens.

2625
02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:45.300
Like maybe that's,
you know,
maybe that's part of it.
Look,

2626
02:33:45.301 --> 02:33:47.060
we know that secrets can be checked out.

2627
02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:52.260
Secrets totally can be kept because we didn't find out about the Gulf of Tonkin

2628
02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:53.940
until like way,
way late.

2629
02:33:54.170 --> 02:33:56.880
Like there were some people involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2630
02:33:57.060 --> 02:34:00.630
When did it become this term knows look,
30 years,

2631
02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:02.970
40 years secrets can be kept,

2632
02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.180
but nowadays it's,
it's,
it's pretty deep.

2633
02:34:08.310 --> 02:34:09.540
Secrets can be kept out.

2634
02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:14.280
Wouldn't the most important secret be we found aliens.

2635
02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:17.100
That would be like one of the biggest secrets you would ever want to keep.

2636
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:21.640
Like the last thing you want is these motherfuckers just freaking out because

2637
02:34:21.641 --> 02:34:25.750
there's aliens.
I like the movies though.
It's just a given.
They're like,
yeah,

2638
02:34:25.751 --> 02:34:29.290
well we just got the spaceships from area 51 yeah.

2639
02:34:29.890 --> 02:34:31.750
How many movies in that though?
A lot.

2640
02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:36.970
Most movies when they try to depict what it would be like if we were attacked.

2641
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:38.290
It's fucking terrible.

2642
02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:42.090
I like the fact that we started off with saving democracy and,

2643
02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:45.650
well you got drunk along the way and so it shifted to alien power.

2644
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:49.990
Standard Arabic.
Footsie one bitch.
When are you going looking for him?
Come on.

2645
02:34:49.991 --> 02:34:52.720
You and dean Kane fucking get up.

2646
02:34:53.410 --> 02:34:57.490
He's got that show on spike and I'll do it as it girl ever scored it on you

2647
02:34:57.491 --> 02:35:01.780
before.
Are you reading my brain?
Are you part of the MSA?

2648
02:35:02.530 --> 02:35:06.070
Is this is?
This is what's happened.
I swines drunk.

2649
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:09.910
The NSA has given you all my information having recently.

2650
02:35:12.490 --> 02:35:17.260
All right,
I love you guys.
Wow Brian,

2651
02:35:17.261 --> 02:35:21.400
I love you.
Champs.
Brian.
There's something,
one less drink.
Seriously.

2652
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:25.720
Just one last.
Keep it together.
Oh,
diamonds.

2653
02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:29.740
What is next for a,
can you remember right now,
if,
uh,

2654
02:35:29.950 --> 02:35:34.000
if we shake your memory,
what's next for your show?

2655
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:37.360
Like what do you got going on that we should know about tomorrow night is

2656
02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:39.190
Greenland.
Uh,

2657
02:35:39.310 --> 02:35:43.090
the world is sinking and a modern day slavery,

2658
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:48.430
David Cho who comes on this show is doing a thing on scrapping,

2659
02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.810
uh,
which uh,
are metal,
is going to build China.

2660
02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:57.370
Um,
this is what we talked about last time you were here I believe.
Yeah.

2661
02:35:57.371 --> 02:36:00.590
He's up on the air is up on their next week.
It's a,

2662
02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:05.620
they're taking metal from old factories in Detroit and using them to build every

2663
02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:09.390
factories in China.
I mean,
but one,

2664
02:36:09.391 --> 02:36:12.700
one place where it's really an issue is Detroit.
Yeah.

2665
02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.240
It's gangs like,
like street gangs.

2666
02:36:15.610 --> 02:36:19.690
How we heard about it was like crips and bloods and shit,

2667
02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.110
we're not going to sell crack anymore cause there's not enough money.

2668
02:36:23.111 --> 02:36:27.130
We're going to go steal like copper from old Packard plants in Detroit.

2669
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:32.200
But like Pittsburgh,
Cleveland,
all the rust belt.
And,
uh,

2670
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:37.510
it was a pretty good story until we
figured out who was buying it,

2671
02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:41.360
which is China.
So our largest export,
$11 billion a year,

2672
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.210
the largest export is scrap from America to China.
Yes.
What's number two?

2673
02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:50.840
I have no idea.
Oranges.
Corn.
No,

2674
02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:54.590
I dunno how number one by a long way,
number one is crap,

2675
02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:56.790
but it's one of those dark things.
They like scrappy.

2676
02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:01.420
Joe Finds it out and then hangs out with these Chinese buyers and it's pretty

2677
02:37:01.421 --> 02:37:05.590
fucking insane.
It's really good.
Um,

2678
02:37:06.010 --> 02:37:10.720
we talked about genetic passports.
Uh,
anyway,

2679
02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:12.700
I don't know.
We have a lot of shit coming up.

2680
02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:16.730
How many episodes you guys do their year?
12.
Wow.
Uh,

2681
02:37:16.731 --> 02:37:19.660
we're probably going to do 24,
actually.
Uh,
now,

2682
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:24.530
now does HBF give you any directorial knows nothing.
Zero.
That's how they do it,

2683
02:37:24.531 --> 02:37:26.960
right?
Yeah.
They give you money and he'd go,
Megan,

2684
02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:31.010
I've been trying to get you to come do a segment with me for a long time.

2685
02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:35.610
That's dangerous and terrible.
We've got to go find that.
Uh,
put a Malibu,

2686
02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:40.840
looks for bad plastic surgery.
I'll just,
okay,
you're fine.

2687
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:42.210
The store look for,
you know,

2688
02:37:42.730 --> 02:37:45.850
I want to go at and I don't want to go do a story with you,
so,
okay.

2689
02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:50.090
What do you want to do?
Like him?
He can't do shit.
No,
no.

2690
02:37:50.730 --> 02:37:54.770
I was actually just looking at him,
but thinking of the world of,
of,

2691
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:58.580
of the nation.
Um,
like what kind of a show would you want to do?

2692
02:37:59.810 --> 02:38:03.410
I don't know if that means we're done on time.
No,
that's just fried.
He's drunk.

2693
02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:05.830
Uh,
what kind of thought?

2694
02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.560
I thought you would enjoy the fucking north poles or you're out of your mind.

2695
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:12.600
Yeah,
you got me wrong.
You don't want to go get the six foot Chad.
The wrong.

2696
02:38:12.690 --> 02:38:16.160
By the way,
you brought up the six foot.
What?
Chimp.
Chimp?
Yeah.

2697
02:38:16.161 --> 02:38:18.770
I'm scared of that chimp because the chimps in the middle of the Congo.

2698
02:38:19.810 --> 02:38:23.330
So where do you want to do I want to go to Congo.
Cuba.
We'll go,

2699
02:38:23.331 --> 02:38:26.230
we'll go interview the Castro and they fucking,

2700
02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:28.700
they check your underwear drawer for the rest of your life every time you check

2701
02:38:28.701 --> 02:38:31.820
into a hotel.
Correct.
You got real problems.
If you've got a Cuban man,

2702
02:38:31.821 --> 02:38:34.110
they look deep up your asshole,
you can't.

2703
02:38:34.111 --> 02:38:37.250
And then the last thing you do is go to Cuba and talk about how you're going to

2704
02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:41.460
Cuba.
Where were you?
Uh,

2705
02:38:42.350 --> 02:38:46.610
I go to Miami with you.
That's about as close second to fucking Cuba.
Yeah.

2706
02:38:46.611 --> 02:38:48.890
I'm not a good guy for your show,
Dude.
I'm telling you.

2707
02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:51.770
I'm a good guy for you to come on and talk about your show.

2708
02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:55.490
I can help you there someday.
I'm going to convince you to come with me.

2709
02:38:55.810 --> 02:39:00.110
I'm trying not to do less and less things.
That's my goal.

2710
02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:02.450
My goal is to do less shit as I get older.

2711
02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.720
It just more more shit where I can just know what I see more than anything from

2712
02:39:08.991 --> 02:39:13.640
this show is one time when I got wasted as opposed to now,
I was like,

2713
02:39:13.641 --> 02:39:15.800
you know what?
We're just trying to get to the fucking cove.

2714
02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:20.330
I must get five tweets a day of like I'm trying to get to my cove.

2715
02:39:20.331 --> 02:39:24.050
I'm trying to get to my co just trying to,
and by the way,
I just came back from,

2716
02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.540
uh,
a long trip to an,
uh,
a shooting.

2717
02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:29.270
I spent three days on a boat in the middle of a cove and I'm like,

2718
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:32.390
I'm trying to get to my cove.
I'm trying to get to my coat.

2719
02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:35.660
I just kept repeating that because I'm just trying to get down there,

2720
02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:38.720
get to the cove and fucking chill the fuck out.
Well,

2721
02:39:38.721 --> 02:39:43.721
I think everybody ultimately has this ideal image in their head of some golden

2722
02:39:43.791 --> 02:39:47.120
retirement or some point in time where everything's going to be still,

2723
02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:50.960
I don't think ever anything's ever still.
I think you got it.

2724
02:39:50.961 --> 02:39:52.580
What I find going to try to get there,

2725
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:56.360
you got to find a balance in the ride itself.
That's where you got to find,

2726
02:39:56.361 --> 02:40:00.320
you can't wait for this rest stops.
This is rest stops are bullshit.

2727
02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:03.960
That's not happening.
But you have more energy and uh,

2728
02:40:04.090 --> 02:40:08.600
like power and in your spine.
I'm an old man.
I'm like,

2729
02:40:08.601 --> 02:40:11.750
you know what?
I'm trying to get to the cove.
I know you are.

2730
02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:13.980
And I'm not saying that I'm not,
I'm not anti

2731
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.813
<v 1>relaxation.</v>

2732
02:40:15.090 --> 02:40:19.830
What I'm saying is that I think if you really did do nothing,

2733
02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:22.020
if you always sat somewhere and did nothing,

2734
02:40:22.021 --> 02:40:24.010
you would only like it for a few days.
You're right.

2735
02:40:24.270 --> 02:40:28.200
You're a guy who likes to investigate things to stimulate your mind and you like

2736
02:40:28.201 --> 02:40:30.180
to be a part of something that's bigger than you.

2737
02:40:30.181 --> 02:40:34.110
There's a reason why the universe chose you for this role.

2738
02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:37.440
I mean that sounds like hippie bullshit.
No,
no,
no.

2739
02:40:37.441 --> 02:40:41.050
But I do want to get to the cove.
I'm sure you do down there.
Let's be,

2740
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:44.100
cause you're,
you probably are a little bit imbalanced.
You work so much.

2741
02:40:44.101 --> 02:40:45.010
It's probably the,

2742
02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:49.920
the cove becomes like this ultimate magnet because you're fucking red lining

2743
02:40:49.921 --> 02:40:51.150
shit all day long.

2744
02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:56.151
They're trying to sleep with the knowledge of Liberia's general buck naked

2745
02:40:56.341 --> 02:40:59.990
running around when he'd killed how many fucking kids and eating their hearts.

2746
02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:04.380
Ma,
you know,
you're fucking hitting the gas all day long,
man.
It's,

2747
02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:08.460
you need to go down the Peru,
get some Iowasca,
cleanse your soul,

2748
02:41:08.490 --> 02:41:11.280
reboot your system.
You've probably seen way too much shit,
man.

2749
02:41:11.370 --> 02:41:14.200
<v 5>Um,
I'm in,
that's why you done with this cove idea.</v>

2750
02:41:14.201 --> 02:41:15.670
He might have to scroll so bad.

2751
02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:18.090
<v 1>I was going to build the cove and you are going to come.</v>

2752
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:19.230
Do you ever consider that,

2753
02:41:19.231 --> 02:41:24.000
that everybody has like this sort of crazy role in this weird machine that is

2754
02:41:24.030 --> 02:41:27.560
life,
this weird complex algorithm that's the human race.
Yeah.

2755
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:30.000
And do you ever wonder why you're in the position that you're in?

2756
02:41:33.430 --> 02:41:36.940
<v 5>No,
but I think that,
I think that everybody,
you're right.</v>

2757
02:41:36.941 --> 02:41:41.740
I think that everybody has a sort of role to play in the grand out algorithm of

2758
02:41:41.741 --> 02:41:46.360
life.
Uh,
my position,
not really because I don't know about you,

2759
02:41:46.361 --> 02:41:47.480
but I'm,

2760
02:41:47.481 --> 02:41:52.481
I'm not any different than I was five years ago when no one listened to me.

2761
02:41:55.330 --> 02:41:56.440
Right.
And

2762
02:41:57.690 --> 02:41:58.220
<v 0>okay,</v>

2763
02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:01.820
<v 5>you know,
money is the modern day report card and,</v>

2764
02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:05.960
and I have a now a lot of money,
but I,
I'm actually giving all that away.

2765
02:42:05.961 --> 02:42:10.130
I'm putting it in a trust.
And even because of the,
you're like,
well I didn't,

2766
02:42:10.131 --> 02:42:11.690
I didn't actually do it for money.

2767
02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.370
I don't actually give a shit about money and I didn't actually do it for fame

2768
02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:17.330
because I don't know about you.

2769
02:42:17.331 --> 02:42:20.300
But like when people come up to you in the street and say,
hey dude,

2770
02:42:20.301 --> 02:42:23.270
fucking awesome.
You're like,
I don't know.
I don't,
you know,
I,

2771
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:25.670
I don't know why you,
I don't know anybody on or whatever.

2772
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:30.260
But what I will say is you sit there at some point and go,
this shit,

2773
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:34.700
I spent 40 years turning the other way and saying,

2774
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:38.360
I don't give a fuck or I'm going to just get drunk or I'm gonna drink a beer.

2775
02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:42.200
I'm going to go get late or I'm going to fucking do what I do.

2776
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:44.030
Because getting to the day is hard.

2777
02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:47.570
And at a certain point you get a little bit older,
you have kids.

2778
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:51.050
For me it was kids and you go,
yeah,
I can't do that anymore.

2779
02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:53.750
I got to sit there and say,
this is bullshit.

2780
02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:56.180
You know what they're fucking doing over there in Iraq.

2781
02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:58.790
It's bullshit is bullshit.

2782
02:42:59.030 --> 02:43:02.240
What you're doing here fucking in the Gulf of Mexico is correct and is bullshit.

2783
02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:05.270
What did it?
And so now I'm like,
you know what?

2784
02:43:05.271 --> 02:43:10.271
I waited for somebody else to fucking say the shit and nobody's saying it and

2785
02:43:11.321 --> 02:43:11.980
I'm not the best

2786
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:13.570
<v 1>person.
And I'll tell you right now,</v>

2787
02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:17.680
I'm not the best person to be saying this shit,
but we have to start saying shit.

2788
02:43:17.681 --> 02:43:20.800
Otherwise we're fucked.
But you,
you are the best person.
I'm not,

2789
02:43:21.010 --> 02:43:25.510
but you're not because you're,
you're look,
no one's the best person,

2790
02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:29.850
but you are as bad as good as example as you're going to get because you bridge

2791
02:43:29.851 --> 02:43:34.240
the gap.
You were a regular human who lived a regular life,

2792
02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:38.440
who got to a point your life where something matter to you much more than it

2793
02:43:38.441 --> 02:43:41.890
mattered before when you had children and then you took a stand.

2794
02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.920
A lot of people would go the other way.
A lot of people when they,

2795
02:43:44.921 --> 02:43:48.880
there's the coward point of view is you get to a point where you have children

2796
02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:52.120
and then you would just want to shut up.
You just want to be quiet.
You want to,

2797
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:56.470
don't,
don't make a lot of noise.
Know.
Yeah.

2798
02:43:57.010 --> 02:44:00.340
<v 5>All of a sudden you're like,
look,
you could have had the best life ever.</v>

2799
02:44:00.341 --> 02:44:03.280
Just keep doing what you're doing.
I could have done the same.
When you have kids,

2800
02:44:03.281 --> 02:44:04.780
you're like,
what the fuck dude?

2801
02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:08.320
That's when the environment becomes important because you're like,
ah,
okay,

2802
02:44:08.321 --> 02:44:09.820
I'm going to die.
It's going to be okay.

2803
02:44:09.930 --> 02:44:13.080
<v 1>Yeah.
There's a certain selfishness there like,
uh,</v>

2804
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:16.860
that a single person will,
um,
for sure.
Um,

2805
02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:20.880
it's not even selfishness really.
It's just thinking about yourself.

2806
02:44:20.910 --> 02:44:25.440
It's like a natural thing I did that we made being selfish.
You know,

2807
02:44:25.441 --> 02:44:28.770
like it doesn't mean you don't think about other people as well.
Like,

2808
02:44:28.771 --> 02:44:33.000
so you should be having kids also because I'm selfish because I want my kids to

2809
02:44:33.001 --> 02:44:37.590
fucking be able to swim in the lake or go outside.
But is that selfish?
I mean,

2810
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:39.720
is the ultimate my kids,

2811
02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:43.290
but isn't the ultimate goal to like see how much you love your kids and say,
man,

2812
02:44:43.291 --> 02:44:45.750
if the whole world could love each other the way I love my kids,

2813
02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:49.800
we would have no fucking problems.
Any problem we would have,
we would work out.

2814
02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.570
But isn't the reality that people don't even do anything when they have no,

2815
02:44:54.690 --> 02:44:58.530
no strife when they have no,
no thing they're battling against.

2816
02:44:58.531 --> 02:45:00.960
They don't really fucking strengthen their resolve.

2817
02:45:00.961 --> 02:45:04.090
They don't really get their shit together.
It's like it seems like we,

2818
02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:07.530
we almost need resistance in order to get anything done.

2819
02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:10.950
We almost need someone to oppose us in order to strengthen ourselves to a

2820
02:45:10.951 --> 02:45:12.390
position where we move forward.

2821
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:17.830
<v 5>I agree and I also think that if left to our own devices,</v>

2822
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:23.000
you're like,
it goes back to that zero sum game.
Like we were talking earlier,

2823
02:45:23.001 --> 02:45:27.200
I said about saying what we've gotten to is this real politic is zero sum game.

2824
02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:30.590
There isn't a zero sum game when you have kids.

2825
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:34.940
There isn't just there's a winner and loser and I kill you and then you are
dead.

2826
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:39.050
You know when you have kids everything becomes like,
wow,
I won.

2827
02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:42.020
But guess what?
They don't have any water to drink.

2828
02:45:42.980 --> 02:45:45.890
So I dunno.
I shifted,

2829
02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:50.920
my whole brain shifted when I had kids because I was a different guy and then

2830
02:45:51.321 --> 02:45:54.500
all of a sudden I have kids and I was like,
actually motherfucker,

2831
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:59.450
I already knew that that was bullshit.
What you were doing.
I knew fucking,

2832
02:45:59.930 --> 02:46:04.220
you know,
$78,000 hammers were bullshit,
but I used to go seven,

2833
02:46:04.290 --> 02:46:08.900
$8 fucking hour and now I'm like,
no,
fuck you.
$78,000 hammers.

2834
02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:11.600
Bullshit.
I don't want to fucking pay my texted for that shit.

2835
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:16.820
And I just got angry because all the bad shit,

2836
02:46:16.821 --> 02:46:19.220
all this stuff that you roll your eyes,
all the shit you say,

2837
02:46:19.221 --> 02:46:22.520
you know this is fucking bullshit.
This is stupid.
We shouldn't be doing this.

2838
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:28.220
I got serious because then you're like,
okay,
it's fine.
Guess what?

2839
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.260
Climate change is undeniable.

2840
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:35.150
The fucking oceans are rising or you want to have a debate,

2841
02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:36.250
you want to have a fucking war.

2842
02:46:36.251 --> 02:46:41.090
You want to the fact that it's even a debate is it fucking joke.

2843
02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:45.800
And guess what?
We don't have the time anymore because our kids are fucked.

2844
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:49.490
So guess what?
I can't fuck around anymore.
Snort coke all night,

2845
02:46:49.491 --> 02:46:51.740
fucking wear my fancy jeans and get wasted.

2846
02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:56.330
I got to go out there and fight these motherfuckers because otherwise my kids

2847
02:46:56.331 --> 02:47:01.130
don't have a fucking future.
And,
and by the way,
not my kids,

2848
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:03.060
everyone's kids.
Did you see that

2849
02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.450
<v 2>NASA report when they,
uh,
they,</v>

2850
02:47:05.451 --> 02:47:09.000
they looked at climate change and a bunch of different factors and they were

2851
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:10.530
talking about the future of the human race.

2852
02:47:10.531 --> 02:47:13.800
They made this extrapolation and I'm like,
we're doomed

2853
02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:19.100
<v 5>now.
If you talk to most scientists,
and like by the way,</v>

2854
02:47:19.101 --> 02:47:23.840
real scientists,
not these dudes in the pay of Exxon,
it's,

2855
02:47:23.890 --> 02:47:28.100
it's like a given.
This is why I get pissed off is because I'm like,
you know,

2856
02:47:28.101 --> 02:47:32.210
who's,
who's done a bad job is the scientific community at,

2857
02:47:32.930 --> 02:47:37.100
at messaging the fact that,
okay,
if there's a fucking loophole,

2858
02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:41.900
if there's like,
well it's this or this within 6% and then everybody else goes,

2859
02:47:41.901 --> 02:47:45.020
well,
6% is this and this is when you're like,
hold on a second.

2860
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:50.530
We are 60 years ahead of our worst case projections,

2861
02:47:50.531 --> 02:47:53.600
the worst case projection of the EPCC 10 years ago.

2862
02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:58.220
We're already 60 years of fucking head,
60 years head.
And I,

2863
02:47:58.310 --> 02:48:01.610
I was talking to the global scientific community,
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2864
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:06.680
Why doesn't anyone know about this?
But you guys are like,
well,
it's a given.

2865
02:48:08.270 --> 02:48:12.680
<v 2>It's not a given with anyone.
I know most people have no idea.
No.</v>

2866
02:48:12.690 --> 02:48:14.750
I know most people have no idea.

2867
02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:17.720
They just go to work and they hear bad things about the economy.

2868
02:48:17.721 --> 02:48:21.920
But then they hear 150,000 new jobs were created last quarter.

2869
02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:26.320
What's happening in California?
So it says Nasa Bay,

2870
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:31.130
NASA back study says human civilization is headed for irreversible collapse.

2871
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:34.610
Yes.
According to the new NASA.
I don't know what that means by NASA back study.

2872
02:48:34.611 --> 02:48:35.840
It sounds very fancy,

2873
02:48:36.470 --> 02:48:40.280
but I'm going to show you understand masses like conservative,

2874
02:48:40.430 --> 02:48:43.460
like there's scientists that,
those are crazy for sure.
Right?

2875
02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:48.190
<v 5>Like when,
whenever I talked to,
uh,
to,
uh,
scientists,</v>

2876
02:48:48.191 --> 02:48:50.980
I tried to get the most conservative motherfuckers cause they,
you know,

2877
02:48:50.981 --> 02:48:53.530
they're gonna come after you.
But the thing is,

2878
02:48:53.531 --> 02:48:58.531
is what's happening now is we are on route for a global cataclysmic

2879
02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:05.110
environmental catastrophe.
And everyone agrees to that.
Right?

2880
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:09.450
Everyone,
right.
But we're,
why aren't we trying to stop it?
Do you think there's

2881
02:49:09.550 --> 02:49:14.550
<v 2>any way that something can be done along the way that we never saw common that</v>

2882
02:49:14.921 --> 02:49:16.450
could fix the whole thing?
Yes.
Yes.

2883
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:21.600
<v 5>What do you think that could be?
Possibly be?
So this is probably bullshit,</v>

2884
02:49:22.650 --> 02:49:27.480
but I was at the Google Zitgeist conference.
There was this kid,

2885
02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:31.770
I tell you this story before he starting years old,
he builds a reactor and his,

2886
02:49:31.771 --> 02:49:35.460
uh,
uh,
did I tell you this guy?
I believe so,
but it's a great story.
You've gone,

2887
02:49:35.490 --> 02:49:40.470
okay.
So he blew me away.
He built a reactor when he was 13,
17.

2888
02:49:40.471 --> 02:49:43.440
He came up with a way to find radioactive way.
Anyway,

2889
02:49:43.650 --> 02:49:46.290
so he came up with this theory,

2890
02:49:46.291 --> 02:49:50.850
which is true that 90% of uranium,
uranium isotopes,

2891
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:54.720
you know,
two or 35 et Cetera,
which we can't dispose of,

2892
02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:00.360
the majority of their energy is still left in there over 90%.
So he's like,

2893
02:50:00.361 --> 02:50:00.990
okay,
we,

2894
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:05.990
we've come up with these reactors where we can take the old energy rods that we

2895
02:50:06.541 --> 02:50:10.740
can't even dispose of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
deplete them.

2896
02:50:10.770 --> 02:50:14.880
And then that will fuel the earth's energy needs for the next 10,000 years

2897
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:18.330
because all of those energy rods from the Soviet Union,
from us,

2898
02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:21.930
uranium two to 35,

2899
02:50:22.350 --> 02:50:26.490
we can all do it now.
Maybe not true,
he's 23 years old.

2900
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:27.743
I don't know.

2901
02:50:28.170 --> 02:50:32.190
But if that's even like 0.0,

2902
02:50:32.191 --> 02:50:37.191
zero zero 1% true that he can take all the shit that we can't even dispose of

2903
02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:41.790
and power the world with it.
Fuck yeah,

2904
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:44.940
that's technology right now.
I don't know if that's true,

2905
02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:49.350
but I'm hoping for some sort of technological solution.

2906
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.631
<v 2>Well,</v>

2907
02:50:49.631 --> 02:50:52.510
I'm hoping along the way he doesn't create something even more fucked up while

2908
02:50:52.511 --> 02:50:57.180
he's trying to rainium which might happen fucking hole.
I don't know.

2909
02:50:57.340 --> 02:51:01.510
<v 5>But what I'm hoping is for some tech solution that comes along to say,</v>

2910
02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:05.410
because you know what the other alternative is?
We're fucked.

2911
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.490
<v 2>Yeah.
I think the tech people are our brightest hope.</v>

2912
02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:12.870
They seem to be self policing.
I mean,
look at the big companies like Google,

2913
02:51:12.930 --> 02:51:15.320
you know,
like they,
they,
they actually,
you know,

2914
02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.470
they spend a lot of money on their employees.
They kind of had global ethics,

2915
02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:21.870
you know,
I mean when at least they try.
Yeah.

2916
02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:25.680
You don't think of an evil company at all.
At least they try.
Yeah.
You've,
you've,

2917
02:51:25.710 --> 02:51:26.041
you know,

2918
02:51:26.041 --> 02:51:30.540
you hear that there's some issues with NSA censorship in certain countries and

2919
02:51:30.541 --> 02:51:32.320
things along those lines,
but when you connect Google,

2920
02:51:32.370 --> 02:51:36.150
you connect them to the idea of a giant corporation that's committed to

2921
02:51:36.151 --> 02:51:39.640
innovation.
They don't seem bad or not Exxon,

2922
02:51:40.140 --> 02:51:41.790
but you know,

2923
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:46.560
that seems to be like something that you find more of in the tech community.

2924
02:51:46.561 --> 02:51:50.100
And I think it's because you're dealing with some really hyper intelligent human

2925
02:51:50.101 --> 02:51:54.640
beings and along with that hyper intelligence and that connection to each other

2926
02:51:54.641 --> 02:51:55.980
that they have,
because the Internet,

2927
02:51:56.220 --> 02:51:59.320
I think you see people that have like a better moral compass.

2928
02:51:59.410 --> 02:52:02.160
They're also trying to solve global problems

2929
02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:06.040
<v 5>by using technology.
No,
I don't,
you know,</v>

2930
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.350
<v 1>I'm not good at technology,
but you're awesome attitude.</v>

2931
02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:09.820
You have vice.com how dare you.

2932
02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:14.910
If I had the ability to figure out the world's energy problems by depleting old

2933
02:52:17.261 --> 02:52:22.150
uranium rods.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
It seems like a good move.
Seems like a good dude.

2934
02:52:22.290 --> 02:52:25.230
Did we run out of Shit?
I love you.
We never want to shift to talk about.

2935
02:52:25.250 --> 02:52:28.120
We just want to love you.
I love you too,
buddy.
It's fun.
You're hammered.

2936
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:31.780

You should probably go to bed.
I love you.

If you've never seen anything,
start with the story on Liberia.

2941
02:52:48.401 --> 02:52:49.810
What's the Liberia one called?

2942
02:52:50.620 --> 02:52:54.910
Then go with vice travels about that dude who lives up in the middle of fucking

2943
02:52:54.911 --> 02:52:59.640
nowhere in the Yukon and lives by himself high Mo's Arctic adventure.
Oh,

2944
02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:01.580
North Korea.
That's how I,
that's a great one too.

2945
02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:05.770
I found out about vice from Heine Mo.
What a great story,

2946
