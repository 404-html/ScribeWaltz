<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before,</v>

20
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but I worked at Great Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concert Center and Mansfield,</v>

21
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

23
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>amongst the security personnel there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was backstage and I got to see</v>

24
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Rodney as he was preparing for a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just have a robe on and nothing</v>

25
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were wearing slippers and he had</v>

26
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>a robe on and he was walking around back</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

27
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>This is before I'd ever done standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

28
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is the shit.</v>

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>

30
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.410

<v Speaker 1>he's literally as comfortable as you can</v>

31
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and</v>

32
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>it's because he could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

35
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.530

<v Speaker 1>I love the way he does it because he</v>

<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

41

<v Speaker 1>my manager Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

49
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>he said that Rodney was just the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the coolest,</v>

50
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>nicest guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to.</v>

93
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's been on my mind and I know you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't want to talk about it</v>

94
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>cause it was broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the</v>

95
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

96
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm just being real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's brought up in,</v>

97
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you are uneasy with it.</v>

98
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It was an ice house chronical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>why would you bring it up again?</v>

100
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I heard Joe talked about gay sex.</v>

101
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>

102
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to make that clear?</v>

103
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I get hassled for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it goes back to you again,</v>

104
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>brody notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's going back to him and gay sex.</v>

105
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you can have sex with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

106
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else of your cousins?</v>

107
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>A transsexual then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it's even more legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends if you're,</v>

109
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're telling someone who writes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>salon,</v>

110
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you're in a few girls that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to their cousins,</v>

111
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but they always use the excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not blood related and they've</v>

112
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:23.321
<v Speaker 1>all done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

113
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have sex with a relative,</v>

114
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>just not into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think people who have done it</v>

115
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of sick.</v>

116
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't see them that often?</v>

117
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I just sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sick.</v>

118
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I think incest is a sickening thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's happened to some young</v>

119
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>girls or kids or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made it would if it's a really good name</v>

120
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's a cousin that you really</v>

121
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it cousin is too close.</v>

122
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>But what if it look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if that cousin is the perfect</v>

123
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>person for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you know it does.</v>

124
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what the heart wants what</v>

125
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brodie and then one good and that's not</v>

126
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the way we treat</v>

127
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>orchids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would we ever expect</v>

128
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>anybody to</v>

129
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 2>be nice to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to exercise the analogy of um,</v>

130
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>of aliens with the younger trainers all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

131
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

132
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 2>we're aliens to these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to make this animal's</v>

133
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:19.881
<v Speaker 2>environment as comfortable as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bearing in mind always we are aliens.</v>

134
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

135
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.540
<v Speaker 2>That's part of relating to the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

136
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 2>are thinking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>

137
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got it.</v>

138
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Start being nicer because if an alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes down,</v>

139
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be sounds as,</v>

140
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid thing to say.</v>

141
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you talking about aliens?</v>

142
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like automatically go goofy with</v>

143
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it's actually,</v>

144
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it's the right analogy because we really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are aliens in their world and we're</v>

145
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>obviously supposedly intelligent where</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously intelligent enough to figure</v>

146
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 1>out how to get them when intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to figure out how to train them,</v>

147
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 1>put them in tents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in tanks,</v>

148
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.470
<v Speaker 1>rather have all these people come to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

149
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>We're obviously intelligent enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>film them.</v>

150
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

151
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>can tell there's a lot of shit going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't do,</v>

152
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>but they've gotta be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

153
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you guys are decks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

154
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>why are you holding on to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't hold on it.</v>

155
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.131
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

156
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't do that.</v>

157
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I think we kill things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't hold onto them.</v>

158
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's when the frustration</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels started boiling for these</v>

159
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause when they're first there,</v>

160
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>when they first arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a green animal if there,</v>

161
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean the bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends if they're a good candidate</v>

162
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 2>for captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've learned real fast that,</v>

163
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the hand that feeds me.</v>

164
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna I want to develop this</v>

165
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

166
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>which is in relationship of like abiding</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this person's,</v>

167
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

168
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodwill,</v>

169
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>the animals and the other ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the same for me.</v>

170
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

171
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>they're cutting out and there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do.</v>

172
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull blood from them,</v>

173
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you checked up blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with them.</v>

174
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 2>This animal's not sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it eating?</v>

175
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And then days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the Sanama debt did not want to</v>

176
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 2>be in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just starve themselves to death.</v>

177
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

178
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 2>The will to live Lawson.</v>

179
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
