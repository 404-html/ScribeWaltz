<v Speaker 1>He would always leave his pants zipped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

14
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>so I had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the actors say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just did it as a square of a</v>

18
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

20
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I worked at Great Woods,</v>

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Concert Center in Mansfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts when I was a kid.</v>

22
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the security personnel there.</v>

23
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I was backstage and I got to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodney as he was preparing for a show.</v>

24
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>He would just have a robot and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

25
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>He was wearing slippers and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot.</v>

26
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And he was walking around back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is before I'd ever done standup</v>

27
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

28
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>that guy is the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

29
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

30
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>he's literally as comfortable as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

31
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because he could,</v>

32
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

33
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can whatever.</v>

34
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's comfortable.</v>

35
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I like the way I love the way he does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can because he keeps fucking.</v>

36
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Rodney did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew he was Rodney dangerfield.</v>

37
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>He never said anything and he played it</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and apparently a super nice</v>

38
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody I know that did business</v>

39
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>with them or had any interactions with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

40
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>always came away from it.</v>

41
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Same Rodney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

42
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>My friend Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my manager,</v>

43
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with one of,</v>

44
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his clients was one of Rodney's</v>

45
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>original comics on the Hbo Comedy Series</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he did.</v>

46
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And he said that Rodney was just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

47
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Just the coolest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicest guy.</v>

48
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>But it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

49
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>But what's worse than that are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sister having sex with your sister.</v>

50
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>That's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the victim.</v>

51
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>There were consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants it.</v>

52
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.610

<v Speaker 1>I thought about that.</v>

53
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>There's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will go to my grave saying I've never</v>

54
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>had sex with my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

55
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some things you want to keep off</v>

56
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>

57
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even want to do it and then</v>

58
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was a mistake.</v>

59
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Never do that again because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really erase it.</v>

60
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.840

<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to.</v>

89
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's been on my mind and I know you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't want to talk about it</v>

90
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>because it was brought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the</v>

91
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was brought up in it?</v>

92
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being real.</v>

93
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Who's brought up in you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you were uneasy with it.</v>

94
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It was an ice house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chronical.</v>

95
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you bring it up again?</v>

96
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Because I heard Joe talked about gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

97
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>

98
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to make that clear?</v>

99
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I get hassled for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it goes back to you again.</v>

100
00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Brody notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>going back to him and gay sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you can have sex with your</v>

102
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>

103
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>What of your cousins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A transsexual than a.</v>

104
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>it's even more legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends if you're a.</v>

105
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're telling someone who writes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salon,</v>

106
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you're in a few girls that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to their cousins,</v>

107
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but they always use the excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not blood related and they've</v>

108
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.321
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have sex with a relative.</v>

110
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Just not into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think people have done it</v>

111
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of sick.</v>

112
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Why you don't see them that often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's sick day.</v>

113
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I think incest is a sickening thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's happened to some young</v>

114
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>girls or kids or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would've been thing.</v>

115
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>What if it's a cousin that you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy?</v>

116
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I think a cousin is too close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what of it?</v>

117
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Look what if that cousin is the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>person for you?</v>

118
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>What if you know it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense,</v>

119
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:57.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know what the heart wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it wants brody and then one that's</v>

120
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the way we treat</v>

121
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would we ever expect</v>

122
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>anybody to</v>

123
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 2>be nice to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to exercise the analogy of um,</v>

124
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>of aliens with the younger trainers all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

125
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

126
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 2>we're aliens to these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to make this animal's</v>

127
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:19.881
<v Speaker 2>environment as comfortable as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bearing in mind always we are aliens.</v>

128
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.413
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

129
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 2>That's part of relating to the animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is or thing like that.</v>

130
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

131
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.160
<v Speaker 2>like I got to start being nicer because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if an alien comes down,</v>

132
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>

133
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:30.770
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

134
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 1>sounds like it's a stupid thing to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's one of those who's your</v>

135
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

136
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>people like automatically go goofy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

137
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:42.300
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right analogy because we really</v>

138
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>are aliens in the world and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously supposedly intelligent.</v>

139
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>We're obviously intelligent enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get them.</v>

140
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 1>We're intelligent enough to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to train them,</v>

141
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.380
<v Speaker 1>put them in tents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in tanks rather.</v>

142
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Have all these people come to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're obviously intelligent.</v>

143
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Have to film them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

144
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>can tell there's a lot of shit going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't do,</v>

145
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>but they've got to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

146
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 2>you guys are dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

147
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>why are you holding onto me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't.</v>

148
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

149
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that.</v>

150
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we killed things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't hold onto them.</v>

151
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that's when the frustration</v>
<v Speaker 2>level start boiling for these animals</v>

152
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 2>because when they're first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they first arrived here as a green</v>

153
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there.</v>

154
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean the bottom line is it depends if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a good candidate for captivity,</v>

155
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>but they learned real fast that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

156
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 2>that's the hand that feeds me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanna I wanna I want to develop</v>

157
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 2>this relationship if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an relationship of abiding by</v>

158
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>this person's race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

159
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodwill,</v>

160
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the animals and the other ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

161
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>this ain't for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

162
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.273
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

163
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 2>they're cutting out and there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do.</v>

164
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull blood from them,</v>

165
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you check that blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with them.</v>

166
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 2>This animal's not sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it eating?</v>

167
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 2>And then days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this animal dead did not want to</v>

168
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>be in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just starve themselves to death.</v>

169
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

170
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 2>The will to live loss.</v>
