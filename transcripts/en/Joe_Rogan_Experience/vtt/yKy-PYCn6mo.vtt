<v Speaker 1>Dumb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

6
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.054
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thanks for introducing me to your </v>

7
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

8
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.433
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you that that video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you grabbing that raccoon and chucking </v>

9
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>it down the stairs was easily one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most gangster things I've ever seen.</v>

10
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>He lets you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this it?</v>

11
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I had to put a little disclaimer up here</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you know the animal rights folks</v>

12
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't get pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that's you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get pissed off anyway.</v>

14
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So right now I hear him crying cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no audio on the cameras but he's</v>

15
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:35.214
<v Speaker 1>like just getting mauled by this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just picked it up and fucking </v>

16
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>chucked it like gangster dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you didn't just push it away.</v>

17
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:44.664
<v Speaker 1>You picked it up over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back behind the head like you're </v>

18
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>throwing a medicine ball.</v>

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause another angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the best tackle over the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head and show boom bang.</v>

21
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>We're talking to Kevin Rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder of dig.</v>

22
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I got to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little liquid courage.</v>

23
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd had a couple of glasses of wine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>

24
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>my intention was to go down there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just kick it.</v>

25
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.613
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was on top of my dog so it'd be </v>

26
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>punting my dog at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tangled.</v>

27
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Who's tangled?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

28
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I grabbed it and it's,</v>

29
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>it's greasy and kind of bristly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

30
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

31
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.944
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

32
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your baby.</v>

33
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds weird to say what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

34
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like I thought he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

35
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.913
<v Speaker 1>He was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was howling like he was getting </v>

36
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with this clause,</v>

37
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm thinking my dog is being killed.</v>

38
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you think it was a coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

39
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had seen recommends in the backyard </v>

40
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.633
<v Speaker 1>before and it was just one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where they always just kind of </v>

41
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>like run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second that the lights come on.</v>

42
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And this time I don't know what he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he had babies.</v>

43
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:44.484
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some other records that we </v>

44
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>saw with him at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I dunno man.</v>

45
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.603
<v Speaker 1>Those weird sort of a fringe wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures like raccoons and coyotes to </v>

46
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of hang around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cities are so creepy.</v>

47
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton in San Francisco.</v>

48
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.813
<v Speaker 1>It's just all over the place at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just dig through the trash </v>

49
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll San Francisco,</v>

50
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.723
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the outside edges has a bit of </v>

51
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>a mountain line problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

52
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

53
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.783
<v Speaker 1>they did this study recently where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>check the digestive tracks of all these </v>

54
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>mountain lines and they thought you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to find deer and rabbit.</v>

55
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found mostly pets.</v>

56
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 50% cats and dogs is what they</v>

57
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to tangle with a mountain</v>

58
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

59
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that they've chosen to </v>

60
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>exist in the periphery of the cities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of feed on these,</v>

61
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>these pets house animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not normal though that a raccoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks a dog like that,</v>

64
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:42.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>They typically just take off that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been our experience with them.</v>

66
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I proceeded to go on Amazon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a trap.</v>

67
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.023
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then I was able to trap what a </v>

68
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.993
<v Speaker 1>few days later and it was evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I went down there just to </v>

69
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:56.754
<v Speaker 1>check out the trap and I saw it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>above and when I got down there it was </v>

70
00:02:59.831 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

71
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>hissing and trying to scratch the cage </v>
<v Speaker 2>at me.</v>

72
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And I mean they're not the friendly ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you see on youtube.</v>

73
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some that are like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>domesticated where they,</v>

74
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 2>the people feed them and then they come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can pet them and whatnot.</v>

75
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these wild ones or,</v>

76
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 2>or just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will cut your throat kind of animals.</v>

77
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I had a feral cat for awhile and I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>tats but feral cats,</v>

78
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it is a completely different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like mine was a kitten.</v>

79
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>It was a little baby will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was really young,</v>

80
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>like maybe three months old at the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you couldn't get anywhere near it.</v>

81
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.893
<v Speaker 2>He'd go near.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone would run up the side of the </v>

82
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.194
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tear apart the curtains shit away from </v>

83
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get rid of it or no,</v>

84
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I kept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>

85
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I locked myself in a bedroom with it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple days,</v>

86
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>aiming it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>break it.</v>

87
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that I had a break it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had to get it used to me it was,</v>

88
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it was a real weird experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Lanie,</v>

89
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 2>she and her boyfriend lived in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment in west Hollywood,</v>

90
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like west La,</v>

91
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:58.654
<v Speaker 2>like Santa Monica area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's these feral cats that had </v>

92
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 2>had babies underneath the apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

93
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

94
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

95
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to trap them.</v>

96
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And so she knew that I already had two </v>
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>

97
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 2>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want a cat?</v>

98
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

99
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me a cat.</v>

100
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you give those to the animal </v>

101
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:19.190
<v Speaker 2>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just terminate him.</v>

102
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I tell him he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too bad.</v>

103
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

104
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 2>it was so hard to get used to this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with hiss at you.</v>

105
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
<v Speaker 2>But when you pick it up it would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would like be the loudest pervs and </v>

106
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>he's so happy that someone was touching </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

107
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but then you put it down just for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second and be like,</v>

108
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>it would run away again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took forever and like it took,</v>

109
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 2>it took years before it would let anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else get even close to it,</v>

110
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 2>like hiding under furniture and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

111
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It would hiss at you and run away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

112
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one that could touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even me,</v>

113
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.221
<v Speaker 2>I had a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

114
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's me.</v>

115
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.073
<v Speaker 2>You know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

116
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're cool and I get close to him,</v>

117
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 2>but he would swing at Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd definitely bite you.</v>

118
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>About a month ago I was looking up how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to break a horse.</v>

119
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that because it kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun thing.</v>

120
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.133
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

121
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>They would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bond he would have.</v>

122
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I know they'll kick your ass though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be fun though.</v>

123
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think good like weekend project.</v>

124
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off the computer.</v>

125
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.413
<v Speaker 2>I could break a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of people that have </v>

126
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:18.094
<v Speaker 2>gotten hurt from horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're falling off horses and broken </v>

127
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 2>arms and legs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

128
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I know a dude got kicked by a horse that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be death.</v>

129
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill like all kinds of animals.</v>

130
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Like dogs barking dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kick them in the dump.</v>

131
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.753
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over.</v>

132
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

133
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 2>you're getting hit by a telephone pole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking,</v>

134
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>things are giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.084
<v Speaker 2>it's an animal that can take a 200 pound</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and run with it on its back for </v>

136
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

137
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.323
<v Speaker 2>Just there's raw power there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Montreal and there's this </v>

138
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>amazing restaurant called Joe beef and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 2>they serve horse there and it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those places where,</v>

140
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.143
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the owners through Anthony </v>

141
00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Bordain.</v>

142
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>He introduced me to them and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

143
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 2>just let us cook for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're like,</v>

144
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead man.</v>

145
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

146
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 2>fuck them in and you'd just let us cook </v>
<v Speaker 2>for course three ways.</v>

147
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.693
<v Speaker 2>Will they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just one of the things they </v>

148
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.060
<v Speaker 2>brought over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know that what it was until it</v>

149
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>like they set it down and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is horse tar tar.</v>

150
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.603
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

151
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What raw horse.</v>

152
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I've had lamb tar tar one time when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in Dubai.</v>

153
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>That was a little funky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very fatty.</v>

154
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of like,</v>

155
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.484
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>film on your mouth after you get done </v>

156
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.441
<v Speaker 2>eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>like the roof of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a little filming,</v>

158
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:33.104
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not fun.</v>

159
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of lamb until I found out what</v>

160
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.374
<v Speaker 2>Lam is.</v>

161
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 2>That it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's baby sheep.</v>

162
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think of cheap though too,</v>

163
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

164
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 2>that's mutton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

165
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like veal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the feel of the mutton world.</v>

167
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

168
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

169
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies will really young.</v>

170
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Immature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

171
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too bad.</v>

172
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>It is too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is tasty.</v>

173
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It's the most delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why when you get lamb chops,</v>

174
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a very small boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

175
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would just assume,</v>

176
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too bad.</v>

177
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of tainted me forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bombed it.</v>

178
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy for you to digest.</v>

179
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.564
<v Speaker 2>For some reason lamb is a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>digestible meat protein wise like for </v>

180
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>it's very good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

181
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people feel like it's a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>high quality meat,</v>

182
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 2>closer to like a a wild game than say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cows and you know,</v>

183
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

184
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>How do they measure that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

185
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.103
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they can measure protein content </v>

186
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 2>somehow and they know that like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

187
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 2>like I think moose as like the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein content like per gram.</v>

188
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.063
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably based on how lean it is </v>

190
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:52.814
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you would assume that it right </v>

191
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.423
<v Speaker 2>down it's piece of Moose would be far </v>
<v Speaker 2>less fat than an eight ounce piece of </v>

192
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 2>domestic beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

193
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably how they measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

194
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.653
<v Speaker 2>Well it looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like lamb looks different than </v>

195
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 2>beef when you look at it as like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>redder sort of a,</v>

196
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 2>unless it's grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass fed beef.</v>

197
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you tried to bear?</v>

198
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I,</v>

199
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>that's when I haven't tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've been curious.</v>

200
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it's pretty oily though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

201
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 2>no it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry.</v>

202
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

203
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.580
<v Speaker 2>well it really depends on how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare it in the field and uh,</v>

204
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.433
<v Speaker 2>what you do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But bear sausage is delicious and bear </v>

205
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>backstraps the Loin is really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>grilled,</v>

206
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.200
<v Speaker 2>but bear you have to be really careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

207
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.203
<v Speaker 2>you can get tricky gnosis a lot of bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>up tricky analysis so you have to make </v>

208
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 2>sure it's cooked to 165 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

209
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

210
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

211
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 2>it's actually so there's no medium rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>

212
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

213
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.693
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way you could ever do that is </v>

214
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 2>if you got tested first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

215
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.714
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd send it to a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you take the bear tongue and you </v>

216
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>send it out to a lab and they test it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is that a,</v>

217
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 2>I think you might have to actually send </v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual meat itself or a piece of </v>

218
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:00.324
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it has trick analysis is </v>

219
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 2>throughout his whole body.</v>

220
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Is it tough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

221
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

222
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 2>There's weird men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies are very mushy.</v>

223
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.813
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think of their bodies like </v>

224
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.643
<v Speaker 2>like an elk or a deer is a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're very muscular like a horse </v>

225
00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 2>is right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bear is almost like gushy.</v>

226
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Like when they die and when you pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up they like a fat person.</v>

227
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.523
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they hibernate and they have those </v>

228
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 2>big fat stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that makes sense.</v>

229
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 2>But they have what you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you would describe it,</v>

230
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>like they have a soft body but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat is very good.</v>

231
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

232
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it's the way I describe is like a pig </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked a deer.</v>

233
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like really cause I like pig.</v>

234
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would like it to dear.</v>

235
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>If I had some men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having some delivered on Thursday.</v>

236
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 2>How long are you going to be in town for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I take off tomorrow.</v>

237
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.073
<v Speaker 2>Next time I'll bring you some a bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>sausage and I'll have it frozen for you </v>

238
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>that you'd take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

239
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

240
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.893
<v Speaker 2>it's also one of those animals were my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend Steve Rinella calls them </v>

241
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 2>charismatic megafauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you say you eat bear,</v>

242
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

243
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like knee jerk.</v>

244
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's one of those game animals where</v>

245
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.144
<v Speaker 2>it's actually imperative that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt them because they don't have any </v>

246
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 2>natural predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they don't get hunted,</v>

247
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 2>if someone doesn't control the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

248
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 2>they decimate the moose and the deer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they eat all the Fonz.</v>

249
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat,</v>

250
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the ground nesting birds.</v>

251
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Then they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also eat each other.</v>

252
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.213
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend that collects </v>

253
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 2>butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

254
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.513
<v Speaker 2>my friend's wife and apparently there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are places in the world where the </v>

255
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 2>butterflies are a serious problem.</v>

256
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Like they overtake and eat crops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like decimate everything.</v>

257
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that these beautiful like,</v>

258
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:46.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

259
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:47.244
<v Speaker 2>seven inch butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she sources them from there where </v>

260
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.144
<v Speaker 2>they actually have to kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it's going to ruin the whole </v>

261
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

262
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collects the dead ones.</v>

263
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.401
<v Speaker 2>Dead ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 2>So she has him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 2>up on the wall kind of in one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cases so you can see them and when</v>

266
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 2>you first walk in you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay asshole.</v>

267
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.043
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there's like all these beautiful </v>

268
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 2>butterflies all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

269
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.304
<v Speaker 2>yeah apparently that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the deal is you have to just </v>

270
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 2>source them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those really,</v>

271
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Really Cool Butterfly Butterfly Pavilion</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Denver is really awesome.</v>

272
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go there and um,</v>

273
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.393
<v Speaker 2>when you go inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all these mres everywhere and </v>

274
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 2>the entire place is just filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>butterflies.</v>

275
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco has one of those as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's cool.</v>

276
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:28.254
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the lands on your head and then </v>

277
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>they're all around you and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave you,</v>

278
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 2>they have to like dust you off cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many butterflies on you,</v>

279
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 2>but they die while you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's shelf life or their,</v>

280
00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:38.340
<v Speaker 2>their life is very short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

281
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die constantly.</v>

282
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Like you find them dead all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>

283
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Not that anybody killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just die of old age.</v>

284
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.773
<v Speaker 2>Like we watched a couple of them just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down on a leaf and all of a sudden </v>

285
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

286
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

287
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>You're only good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

288
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long has the butterfly live?</v>

289
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it say how long a butterfly lives?</v>

290
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a super zen moments.</v>

291
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say a butterfly lives a week.</v>

292
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a week sounds about right.</v>

293
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a little last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so I'm looking,</v>

294
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you say a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd say a little less than that.</v>

295
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.143
<v Speaker 2>There's so amazing looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a strange thing that nature </v>

296
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.893
<v Speaker 2>can create all of these beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>designs and shapes and they'll just </v>

297
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>different forms of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

298
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

299
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Especially in bug forum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.633
<v Speaker 2>bugs are some of the most were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we entirely take bugs for </v>

301
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 2>granted this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of them,</v>

302
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 2>they're so common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

303
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 2>A month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

304
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They last a month.</v>

305
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you done any of that bug protein </v>

306
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 2>powder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

307
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done the cricket stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Ferriss has entail.</v>

308
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

309
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I like bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

310
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I really think that's probably because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my time on fear factor.</v>

311
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I got super used to people eating bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I liked the idea of it because it is</v>

312
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 2>like probably one of the most ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

313
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.443
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>

314
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.283
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the easiest to source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs very little like land and </v>

315
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 2>ground and for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even vegans,</v>

316
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 2>most vegans don't have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you eating bugs.</v>

317
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Like most vegans will slap a mosquito,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

318
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.034
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to let some mosquito </v>

319
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 2>just vampire off right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll kill a mosquito.</v>

320
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So we have these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hierarchy of life.</v>

321
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant life is at the lowest.</v>

322
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:14.764
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to kill and eat plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it gets up to weird animals </v>

323
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 2>like bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've heard of fruitarians.</v>

324
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Those are even more extreme than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the general plants.</v>

325
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 2>They only eat fallen fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I had an aunt that was a fruitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

327
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was crazy.</v>

328
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:27.154
<v Speaker 2>Was she in bad shape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't get a lot of </v>

329
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 2>essential stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't talked in a long,</v>

330
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was,</v>

331
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 2>she was crazy when I was a little kid.</v>

332
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 2>She was a vegetarian when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

333
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I think I was like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight and it was,</v>

334
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 2>she only fallen fruit like fruit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has fallen off the tree,</v>

335
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 2>cause extreme version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she probably picked it.</v>

336
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.603
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know her very well and </v>

337
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:55.400
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't very close even to our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

338
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 2>She'd have her on the crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she'd be into it.</v>

339
00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.134
<v Speaker 2>And she's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if she's around </v>

340
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:01.474
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably in her late sixties at </v>

341
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she was,</v>

343
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.360
<v Speaker 2>she was a nutty hippie from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the 60s had some kids and my cousins </v>
<v Speaker 2>just lost her fucking mind.</v>

345
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rotarians man.</v>

346
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was deep in the,</v>

347
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.460
<v Speaker 2>the world of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she had,</v>

348
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.840
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't healthy like mentally or </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>

349
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like someone that would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

350
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the way to go.</v>

351
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look at this crazy bitch.</v>

352
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

353
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 2>cause she didn't even like her kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she didn't have a good relationship</v>

354
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.010
<v Speaker 2>with her own children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

355
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to take you seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fucking fruit,</v>

356
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How will you be nice to people?</v>

357
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

358
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.363
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've all looked at like </v>

359
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:45.870
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians had been like seeing someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>really healthy and thought,</v>

360
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're glowing.</v>

361
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would also like to glow.</v>

362
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see myself doing that,</v>

363
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fruit stuffs a little too far.</v>

364
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I started hunting,</v>

365
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I had two thoughts in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

366
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 2>this was going to turn me into a Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to become a hunter.</v>

367
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 2>So those are the two things that I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it with.</v>

368
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.153
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

369
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of health benefits</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eating a lot of vegetables.</v>

370
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

371
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.983
<v Speaker 2>100% it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the real issue is it becomes </v>

372
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>sort of a weird religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes almost like a,</v>

373
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cult.</v>

374
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Like it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no variables.</v>

375
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.953
<v Speaker 2>It's like eating animals is evil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are sentient beings in this </v>

376
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.753
<v Speaker 2>despite what they do to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that like I had a </v>

377
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>friend who's a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this conversation and I said,</v>

378
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 2>so no animal should be killed ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

379
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

380
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two words for you.</v>

381
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

382
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

383
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be controlled somehow.</v>

384
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck are you going to do that?</v>

385
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 2>You have hundreds of millions of acres </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have wild pigs.</v>

386
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 2>The amount of wild pigs in this country </v>
<v Speaker 2>is staggering.</v>

387
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exploding.</v>

388
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And there's [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a highway that they opened up in</v>

389
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Texas and they had built this highway </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they opened it up one night and</v>

390
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:57.764
<v Speaker 2>then that one night they opened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had like 40 car accidents with </v>

391
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>pigs.</v>

392
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

393
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Texas is out of feathers as Rana pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get his pets.</v>

394
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Pigs are taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nanopay have using seen the nano pink.</v>

395
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny pet pigs.</v>

396
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 2>They're like the size of a small toy </v>
<v Speaker 2>poodle.</v>

397
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 2>But then they always have those like </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

398
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't been around for awhile.</v>

399
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>But they're becoming very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially here in la.</v>

400
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't seen them in la?</v>

401
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 2>He'll walk them like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would think that I would like,</v>

402
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 2>because I live out here that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand this place,</v>

403
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.690
<v Speaker 2>but my interaction with La is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store and the Improv going to</v>

404
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>the comedy clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to where I buy food,</v>

405
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 2>going to my neighborhood and being with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends and going to the gym,</v>

406
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 2>like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever I work out.</v>

407
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you enjoy the city then?</v>

408
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many people here.</v>

409
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>

410
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 2>oh look at these little cute little </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucker.</v>

411
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>They're cute little bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that little ball.</v>

412
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's a baby though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a baby naming a question.</v>

413
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you get them though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

414
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 2>And how big do they get when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>full grown?</v>

415
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I think just like toy poodle size.</v>

416
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Great pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

417
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 2>They're really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at they look guitars.</v>

418
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's real.</v>

419
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>They entertain you apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes for them.</v>

420
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>What a little cutie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very cute.</v>

421
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.243
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a big goddamn </v>

422
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>difference between a domesticated pig </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you raise yourself.</v>

423
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:24.180
<v Speaker 2>That becomes like a pet and a wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

424
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were in,</v>

425
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ranch,</v>

426
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.333
<v Speaker 2>this tone ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were hunting wild pigs were walking </v>

427
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 2>down this road and it was the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had any contact with them.</v>

428
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard them.</v>

429
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.473
<v Speaker 2>And they were in this tall grass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were maybe like 20 yards from us </v>

430
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and they were fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're walking down this row were like</v>

431
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 2>tip toeing down this road and we here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

432
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>this is like some Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit man.</v>

433
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 2>They have like the full tusks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

434
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>So these are Moore's basically.</v>

435
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.083
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See a pig is something called sue </v>

436
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Scrofani.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how you say it.</v>

437
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.020
<v Speaker 3>And that genus is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all the same thing.</v>

438
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:01.854
<v Speaker 3>They're like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they could breed with each other and </v>

439
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.900
<v Speaker 3>they're the same animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means is,</v>

440
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 3>this is a weird thing about pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take a domestic pig,</v>

441
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 3>regular pig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink pig,</v>

442
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.450
<v Speaker 3>and you leave them out in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they transform into that really well.</v>

443
00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 3>They grow tusks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow tusks,</v>

444
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 3>their nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their nose extends,</v>

445
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 3>their body for gets thicker and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dense and it happens really quickly.</v>

446
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I believe that transformation starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take place within six weeks.</v>

447
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 3>So it was in within six weeks of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild and out in the wild,</v>

448
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 3>having to fend for itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not having food given to it.</v>

449
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 3>It's body starts to transform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange animal.</v>

450
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they know how to fend for themselves </v>

451
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 3>and eat and all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think instincts take over.</v>

452
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 3>They get desperado mean whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instincts are still left in the genes.</v>

453
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.010
<v Speaker 3>The fasting and ketosis brings it out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them with,</v>

454
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they made a lot of carbs I think.</v>

455
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

456
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 3>but they'll eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

457
00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

458
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 3>ground nesting birds get decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything in front of them.</v>

459
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for agriculture,</v>

460
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:07.880
<v Speaker 3>for places where they have farms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely devastating.</v>

461
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.930
<v Speaker 3>It costs millions and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars worth of damage.</v>

462
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.063
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you can leave all animals </v>

463
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 3>alone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you won't be able to go outside,</v>

464
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:16.650
<v Speaker 3>you'll have a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

465
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the mountain lion issues,</v>

466
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 3>a big issue in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

467
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.010
<v Speaker 3>and right now it's pretty much under </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

468
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's good,</v>

469
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 3>there's good things to it too though.</v>

470
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the good things to it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't have deer ticks.</v>

471
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.123
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a lot of ticks out here </v>
<v Speaker 3>like they do on the east coast because </v>

472
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 3>the east coast doesn't have mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>lions.</v>

473
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of that,</v>

474
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 3>and they don't have nearly as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes and see coyotes,</v>

475
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:40.740
<v Speaker 3>kimberly take out a full sized deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can really,</v>

476
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 3>they fuck up the Fonz and they kill a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the babies,</v>

477
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but they can't relate to the big deer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>can kind of fend off a coyote,</v>

478
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 3>but they can't fend off I'm outline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

479
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 3>And Mountain Lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack.</v>

480
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 3>So many deer that we don't have problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

481
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Like lyme disease out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like lyme disease is a huge problem.</v>

482
00:19:57.211 --> 00:19:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I've had coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend that got it here a couple</v>

483
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 3>of years ago out here to fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

484
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:02.280
<v Speaker 3>east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>East Coast.</v>

485
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's coast.</v>

486
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 3>It's real bad.</v>

487
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.711
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

488
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:05.544
<v Speaker 3>there was some estimate that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in like the Hudson valley </v>

489
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.723
<v Speaker 3>where they did a test of all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ticks and some ungodly </v>

490
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 3>percentage had lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

491
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>More than 50% of the ticks had lyme </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

492
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 3>which is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

493
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Cause that'll socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

494
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 3>and it's what's fucking devastating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your immune system.</v>

495
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 3>It really wrecks your body and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get it and they keep it forever.</v>

496
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just fucks with their system </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

497
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy that had to go on hardcore</v>

498
00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second you get diagnosed with it and</v>

499
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 3>you have to do cycles of those to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get it out.</v>

500
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 3>It's really brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

501
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who got it and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought his son.</v>

502
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 3>His son got it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he brought his son to the doctor and</v>

503
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.923
<v Speaker 3>it was a shitty doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doctor didn't want to believe that </v>

504
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 3>the kid had disease</v>

505
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 2>and then all of sudden the kid's face </v>
<v Speaker 2>went palsy.</v>

506
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>He had bell's palsy where his mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>started drooling and his,</v>

507
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:54.334
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lips wouldn't move to that comeback </v>

508
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 2>or is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

509
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Hardcore antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intravenous antibiotics.</v>

510
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.640
<v Speaker 2>And they had to do it for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month of hardcore antibiotic.</v>

511
00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

512
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a scary disease man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it also was related to,</v>

513
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that more Jerilyn's disease,</v>

514
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.383
<v Speaker 2>which for a long time they thought more </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous might be some sort of a </v>

515
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:21.034
<v Speaker 2>psychosomatic disorder where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe they had like fiber's going out </v>

516
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>of their skin and they're itching </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves constantly.</v>

517
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 2>And they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would bring these fibers to doctors</v>

518
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>to exam and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body's growing these fibers.</v>

519
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

520
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.923
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was going on was that the fibers </v>

521
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 2>were like carpet fibers and things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were stuck to their skin.</v>

522
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.203
<v Speaker 2>And so I interviewed this guy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>more gel and suffer and he was also a </v>

523
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:48.910
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of fascinating,</v>

524
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get his perspective on it.</v>

525
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:51.754
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was very frustrated by the way </v>

526
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.783
<v Speaker 2>the medical establishment treats us </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease because they were treating it </v>

527
00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 2>like it's like a completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological disorder.</v>

528
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

529
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a neuro toxicity to this</v>

530
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:05.884
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that one of the things about this </v>

531
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 2>disease was a vast majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who hadn't made more jealous also</v>

532
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 2>had lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he thinks,</v>

533
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough people that have it,</v>

534
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks his lyme disease affects </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>

535
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.053
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of neuro toxicity to this lyme disease </v>

536
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 2>when it gets to some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing he said,</v>

537
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.070
<v Speaker 2>when you get lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have a,</v>

538
00:22:31.071 --> 00:22:31.904
<v Speaker 2>a tick that gives you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this disease and the tick carries it in </v>

539
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:36.454
<v Speaker 2>his body gives to you.</v>

540
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's giving it to you in a</v>

541
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:41.440
<v Speaker 2>syringe and it's a pure form of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

542
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're getting a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different pathogens along with that.</v>

543
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was describing it to me,</v>

544
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:48.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

545
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:49.234
<v Speaker 2>this totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just as very small sample </v>

546
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:54.610
<v Speaker 2>size of people who have this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the people haven't,</v>

547
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get fucking crazy.</v>

548
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you go out to the east coast at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>

549
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you avoid all the tapes like I go but</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll spray stuff.</v>

550
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 2>There's clothing that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

551
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.523
<v Speaker 2>that they've designed for people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in those areas that you make sure </v>

552
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 2>socks up to like the beltline kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

553
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 2>But you can get bit even through socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really pants and,</v>

554
00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

555
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.433
<v Speaker 2>boot gators and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to make sure that they don't get </v>

556
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>in the crevices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

557
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and if you come in contact with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal that has it,</v>

558
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:25.324
<v Speaker 2>you have to be really careful that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure those ticks don't come off and get </v>

559
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:30.320
<v Speaker 2>onto you and you gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

560
00:23:30.321 --> 00:23:31.360
<v Speaker 2>it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

561
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>that's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's so scary?</v>

562
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Because it fucks with your immune system</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it really,</v>

563
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.480
<v Speaker 2>depending upon how bad you get it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are and what your makeup is,</v>

564
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just have a really nasty </v>

565
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 2>averse reaction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of fact,</v>

566
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>my friend's dad got</v>

567
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.053
<v Speaker 3>it from a vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to give a vaccine for lyme </v>

568
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 3>disease and they don't do it anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it could turn into full blown.</v>

569
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the stuff you always worry about.</v>

570
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's one of those things like,</v>

571
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the people that get the flu </v>

572
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 3>shot every once in a while somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes down with a full blown for sure.</v>

573
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

574
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was always the argument about,</v>

575
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccines too.</v>

576
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Like people were always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

577
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 3>there's this always this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing like,</v>

578
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 3>hey vaccines give people autism vaccines</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

579
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the other campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccines are harmless.</v>

580
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never harmless.</v>

581
00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 3>He shoot a chemical in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harmless.</v>

582
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beneficial the vast majority of the</v>

583
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:26.144
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're one of those one out of a </v>

584
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.843
<v Speaker 3>thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much comfort in the </v>

585
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:31.064
<v Speaker 3>fact that your brain gets fucking fried </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they tried some experimental </v>

586
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking weird vaccine on.</v>

587
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any of that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any of the,</v>

588
00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flu shots every year?</v>

589
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.831
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

590
00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:41.664
<v Speaker 1>I don't do flu shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did it this year and I came down </v>

591
00:24:43.171 --> 00:24:44.880
<v Speaker 1>with the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got decimated.</v>

592
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those guys that has a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong immune system until I don't,</v>

593
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm like out for like a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

594
00:24:51.241 --> 00:24:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>licking my fingers all the time and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to just feel invincible.</v>

596
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:57.204
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't gotten sick for like 10 </v>

597
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 1>months and I don't wash my hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and it's disgusting.</v>

598
00:25:02.071 --> 00:25:05.040
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I just went down hard this year.</v>

599
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many factors,</v>

600
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:08.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like health,</v>

601
00:25:08.131 --> 00:25:10.200
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

602
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I think I was doing too much cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy stuff.</v>

603
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.441
<v Speaker 1>Cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

604
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Like Wim Hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

605
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm off stuff too much.</v>

606
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Rhonda Patrick,</v>

607
00:25:18.091 --> 00:25:20.400
<v Speaker 1>who you've had on the show before about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and um,</v>

608
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just too many stressors cause that's a </v>

609
00:25:22.441 --> 00:25:23.274
<v Speaker 1>stressor.</v>

610
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have green teas,</v>

611
00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:26.100
<v Speaker 1>a stress or you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turmeric is a stressor.</v>

612
00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:26.934
<v Speaker 1>You have exercise as a stressor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're doing that every single </v>

613
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.920
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing the cold stuff,</v>

614
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>six days a week along with,</v>

616
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking cryo but like cold ice,</v>

617
00:25:38.671 --> 00:25:40.350
<v Speaker 1>cold showers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

618
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.640
<v Speaker 1>and then along with exercising and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interval training and everything else,</v>

619
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.320
<v Speaker 1>cold showers,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but their showers when he turned to the </v>

624
00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:56.070
<v Speaker 1>cold setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky at home.</v>

625
00:25:56.071 --> 00:25:56.904
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the gym and on the cold setting </v>

626
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I put my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

627
00:26:00.961 --> 00:26:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

629
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:05.680
<v Speaker 1>numb within 45 seconds.</v>

630
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cold.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

632
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Well New York has some fucking severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold winter.</v>

633
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get that cold water in the </v>

634
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.060
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real cold water.</v>

635
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People call it to talk about cold water </v>

636
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cold.</v>

637
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

638
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:22.540
<v Speaker 1>he'd go into a glacier river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bummed when I come out here cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and I stay at a hotel or something.</v>

640
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:27.114
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing I do when I get in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel is on cold setting in the showers </v>

641
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.100
<v Speaker 1>to see what we're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all week.</v>

642
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

643
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to go do proper cryo if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that.</v>

644
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Well it's great after yoga in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>

645
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.113
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually get pretty cold water </v>

646
00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>here in like January in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like</v>

647
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 2>after a hot yoga class it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably cold.</v>

648
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you can't breathe.</v>

649
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like a probably more of a reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in Cryo.</v>

650
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.293
<v Speaker 2>Oh interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was cry was weird cause it's cold as </v>

651
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's dry.</v>

652
00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.613
<v Speaker 2>So get in there and there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where they talked about the </v>

653
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

654
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a dry heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

655
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.203
<v Speaker 2>it's a dry cryo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's California's heat too in </v>

656
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.720
<v Speaker 2>comparison to like praxis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you ever been to Houston in July.</v>

657
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.600
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to breathe through.</v>

659
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're getting waterboarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

660
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Like nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

661
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hot fucking wet blanket on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>

662
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.040
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

663
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

664
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.593
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a definitely difference in that </v>

665
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:23.880
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you're not getting wet.</v>

666
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.863
<v Speaker 2>Like Wim Hof actually prefers ice baths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks the ice baths or better for </v>

667
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

668
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 2>and the way he describes it better for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your spirit.</v>

669
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

670
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I've done the ice pass a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was week 10 for me on his,</v>

671
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:36.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his course.</v>

672
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I went and got 10 bags of ice from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner store,</v>

673
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>filled up my bathtub with cold water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then put all 10 bags of ice in there,</v>

674
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 2>a submerged myself up to my neck and did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for 15 minutes.</v>

675
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get anything out of it?</v>

676
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say I am a,</v>

677
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge believer in just cryo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold therapy in general in that,</v>

678
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

679
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>my mood is elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than anything else.</v>

680
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's my mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

681
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I find myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>

682
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm generally a really happy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

683
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have their ups and downs as as it</v>

684
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this kind of just raises the bar and</v>

685
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.580
<v Speaker 2>additional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like 20%.</v>

686
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a higher high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

687
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:19.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always gonna stay up pegged up there and</v>

688
00:28:19.861 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 2>be like a whole new person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just different.</v>

689
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.121
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

690
00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a game changer for me.</v>

691
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I've gotten really deep on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>research side,</v>

692
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 2>different than Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda goes the science route.</v>

693
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.823
<v Speaker 2>I go into the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been researching people that </v>

694
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:35.214
<v Speaker 2>have done this for hundreds of years now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their protocols and what they've </v>

695
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what have you found?</v>

696
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not ready to release it yet.</v>

697
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Dare you teased?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

698
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing a ton of research.</v>

699
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:45.174
<v Speaker 2>I'm either going to put out like a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>pdf on it or a little mini ebook or </v>

700
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 2>something that'll give away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

701
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:50.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

702
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't give us a like a taste.</v>

703
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good taste would be,</v>

704
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me think here.</v>

705
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>There's some people in Russia that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it for a long time,</v>

706
00:28:58.501 --> 00:28:59.334
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got ahold of their original </v>

707
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>documents and had them translated so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could figure out what the protocol is to</v>

708
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Banja and then for freezing water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

709
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fado or Amelion Inco,</v>

710
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 2>like probably the greatest heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC or mma rather fighter of all time.</v>

711
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 2>He was a pride heavyweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.540
<v Speaker 2>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

713
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.463
<v Speaker 2>that was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would do the Banya when they beat </v>

714
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 2>each other with those eucalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 2>branches.</v>

715
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:21.181
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

716
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I've done that ton of time by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>private other branches,</v>

717
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>but I've watched it being done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fast.</v>

718
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does look cool.</v>

719
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I bet it would be refreshing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

720
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:29.000
<v Speaker 2>and get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

721
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 2>they're not hurting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

722
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:31.254
<v Speaker 2>they just slap you around with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>branches and they climb from the hot </v>

723
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 2>sauna and the climate to the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I always thought of it was just</v>

724
00:29:37.441 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>like something that makes you feel a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit better.</v>

725
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>But when you read and to Rhonda</v>

726
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.083
<v Speaker 1>and her research on Sauna and 40% less </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality across the board from all </v>

727
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cancer,</v>

728
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack,</v>

729
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 1>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

730
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 1>what percent drop in mortality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's incredible there.</v>

731
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.603
<v Speaker 1>And then she ducks about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical measurable responses to Sauna </v>

732
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 1>to extreme heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat shock proteins,</v>

733
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.380
<v Speaker 1>and then also cold shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize like,</v>

734
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.243
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some something really going on </v>

735
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

736
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.943
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could feel it after a couple of </v>

737
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 1>weeks for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>

738
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends do one and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

739
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:13.361
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

740
00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it's too cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

741
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

742
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not about just that one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about for you,</v>

743
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:23.040
<v Speaker 1>but it was about week two to week three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all of a sudden I just woke up and</v>

744
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

745
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm 16 again.</v>

746
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a little bit.</v>

747
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>My mood was just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

748
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

749
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>what does she call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>North northern epinephrine,</v>

750
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine.</v>

751
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.103
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor epinephrin nor [inaudible] nor </v>

752
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 1>epinephrin norepinephrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

753
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 1>That stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you get,</v>

754
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 1>it's very tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drug.</v>

755
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like [inaudible] like </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a little,</v>

756
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 1>just a tiny taste of pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little,</v>

757
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.800
<v Speaker 1>just a little text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

758
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I brought that up in our podcast that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did with her.</v>

759
00:30:54.351 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

760
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.953
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're at a concert and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a little hitter and then </v>

761
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:57.631
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

762
00:30:57.631 --> 00:30:58.464
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

763
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

764
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

765
00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 1>It makes the sun feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

766
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

767
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and also for aches and pains and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

768
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:08.284
<v Speaker 1>for someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who trains a lot the measurable effect </v>

769
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.560
<v Speaker 1>that they found as far as like reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inflammatory markers in the blood,</v>

770
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you can feel that.</v>

771
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.903
<v Speaker 1>You can absolutely feel the response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you do it like a week or two </v>

772
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:22.804
<v Speaker 1>in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

773
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

774
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 1>so do you know that cold therapy used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

775
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was used as a treatment for </v>

776
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 1>insanity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that back in the day?</v>

777
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.813
<v Speaker 1>So van Gogh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he cut his ear off and they put </v>

778
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:39.380
<v Speaker 1>them in the insane asylum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

779
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:44.550
<v Speaker 1>they've forced him to do two weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hour long sessions of cold therapy.</v>

780
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.053
<v Speaker 1>And he writes about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little teaser of some of this </v>

781
00:31:48.241 --> 00:31:49.074
<v Speaker 1>stuff research I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes about it in his letters to </v>

782
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:53.974
<v Speaker 1>friends and so his letters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented online and you can find the </v>

783
00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:58.114
<v Speaker 1>Vango letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I've dug into all of his </v>

784
00:32:00.341 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>letters and found any mention of cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and what it's done to his mood.</v>

785
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.653
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

786
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And what was he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just saying that,</v>

787
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could look it up.</v>

788
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:08.734
<v Speaker 1>He was just saying that he was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>believer and he's feeling so much </v>

789
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

790
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 1>and then I found pictures of the tub </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they used to use.</v>

791
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:16.384
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is he would lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>down in a bathtub and they would put </v>

792
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 1>this like wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

793
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>cover over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just with your head's sticking out.</v>

794
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So almost like a guillotine kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

795
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a gay teen was the one where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>chop your head off getting okay.</v>

796
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.093
<v Speaker 1>And so they have his head sticking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they would just pour ice cold </v>

797
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:36.120
<v Speaker 1>water through the tub if for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice a week.</v>

798
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

799
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck them.</v>

800
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And they would do this to treat insanity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it worked.</v>

801
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>And then of course drugs came along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

802
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 2>And then all of this just gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgotten.</v>

803
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one example.</v>

804
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Another one is I found some monks out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

805
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 2>in Japan that study this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

806
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>this form of meditation and Buddhism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where they sit underneath,</v>

807
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm waterfalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waterfalls,</v>

808
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:00.224
<v Speaker 2>and they meditate and I found their </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance and all of that that go along </v>

809
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:03.554
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something I'm going to put in </v>

810
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:06.430
<v Speaker 2>this document as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

811
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Hixon Gracie is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds familiar.</v>

812
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Hicks and Gracie is the grappler Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

813
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.700
<v Speaker 2>He's hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gracie is the guy won the original UFC,</v>

814
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.293
<v Speaker 2>but he had his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother Hixon as almost like a </v>

815
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.313
<v Speaker 2>mythical creature in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts because he's universally </v>

816
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>hailed as the greatest Jujitsu fighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>

817
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Universally by,</v>

818
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy they call it the Michael</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan of Jujitsu.</v>

819
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many good guys.</v>

820
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:37.730
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to figure out who's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

821
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy might be that guy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next year that guy can beat this guy,</v>

822
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 2>but this is Hickson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also a legit Yogi,</v>

823
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>like you practices yoga on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

824
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:47.760
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

825
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.623
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing and you know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually been on the podcast too </v>

826
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>and I had to check to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the buffets.</v>

827
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Yoga was very buff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when he was young.</v>

828
00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a mixed martial arts champion,</v>

829
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 2>a Brazilian Jujitsu champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was also the champion.</v>

830
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>He was in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hulk.</v>

831
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:05.474
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was teaching Ed Norton how to </v>

832
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 2>control his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

833
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.953
<v Speaker 2>his calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A control is a his anger to try to keep </v>

834
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>them from turning into the hulk.</v>

835
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.903
<v Speaker 2>But there's this documentary called </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke and it documents Hicks and </v>

836
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>competing in the 1994 Japan valley to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doe.</v>

837
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 2>He went over to a [inaudible] 96,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 96,</v>

838
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what year it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

839
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.563
<v Speaker 2>but he went over to Japan and competed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this big mixed martial arts </v>

840
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:30.194
<v Speaker 2>tournament and when he was over there as</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the time that he spent was </v>

841
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.063
<v Speaker 2>climbing into these freezing cold rivers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting out of these waterfalls and </v>

842
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 2>meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's awesome.</v>

843
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.133
<v Speaker 2>And there's video of him doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like his other family members tried to </v>

844
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:41.654
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get in the water for a couple </v>

845
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:42.711
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

846
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>fuck this right there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in there doing these,</v>

847
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 2>a yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing exercises.</v>

848
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what women teaches a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing to go along with.</v>

849
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 2>You have to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really careful.</v>

850
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:56.230
<v Speaker 2>There's been people that have passed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the breathing exercise cause there</v>

851
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.450
<v Speaker 2>there's so deep and it's really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving you all that oxygen.</v>

852
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it oxygen meter on my finger when </v>

853
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I do the breathing exercises and I take </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

854
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a right around 98 like no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever really at a 100 all the time.</v>

855
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:07.874
<v Speaker 2>Some people weird people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can bring myself up to a hundred </v>

856
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>percent and what does it measuring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen and the level in your blood?</v>

857
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I just pure oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

858
00:35:15.191 --> 00:35:16.024
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those little meters that they </v>

859
00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:18.620
<v Speaker 2>clip on you when you go to the doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

860
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 2>you can buy those for $15 on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

861
00:35:21.201 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>but how's it did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it tapping into your blood somehow?</v>

862
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.694
<v Speaker 2>Like how it measuring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little led light that it shoots </v>

863
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>into your finger and through looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the led through finger,</v>

864
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:32.174
<v Speaker 2>like the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your phone can measure your heart </v>

865
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

866
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>So this does heart rate along with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood oxygen level.</v>

867
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.570
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does it know your blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen level?</v>

868
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I think magic and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

869
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:42.234
<v Speaker 2>this what a wonderful world we live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's available on Amazon prime for </v>

870

<v Speaker 2>it's also will be here in one hour of </v>

871

<v Speaker 2>Western civilization.</v>

873
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.173
<v Speaker 2>The people that run those ups stores </v>
<v Speaker 2>that get packages delivered to them and </v>

874
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:00.354

<v Speaker 2>they did not know what they're signing </v>

00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 2>up for with one click and came around </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide rates through the roof.</v>

876
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.303
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta be hating life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe they just really in the </v>

877
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 2>packages and they love it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Someone who has like a package fetish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

882
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.753

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>

885
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.363
<v Speaker 2>You know how there's those people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into video games like Farmville and </v>

886
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:30.940
<v Speaker 2>all that and they spend like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

887
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 2>There has to be the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>

888
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:33.421
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:34.254
<v Speaker 2>you don't have people that just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>click the shit out of Amazon every </v>

890
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.490
<v Speaker 2>single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather was dying.</v>

891
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.503
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was really old after my </v>

892
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.694
<v Speaker 2>grandmother died in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like super depressed and he got </v>

893
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 2>addicted to catalogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad.</v>

894
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>They like my dad before he passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started,</v>

895
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:52.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he would give us,</v>

896
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 2>getting into his seventies started doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>just more qvc shopping and just stuff to</v>

897
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 2>shows up and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

898
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 2>why'd you buy that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And granted,</v>

899
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean he always had you always get cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

900
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

901
00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a cool way to slice tomatoes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be that showed up,</v>

902
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need it.</v>

903
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I think old people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just are,</v>

904
00:37:10.741 --> 00:37:11.574
<v Speaker 2>as our brain starts to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just come more susceptible to that </v>

905
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is by everything.</v>

906
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why those late night </v>

907
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:20.440
<v Speaker 2>televangelists are so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Dangerous.</v>

908
00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.553
<v Speaker 2>They are preying on people with faulty </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms and then they call it and </v>

909
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:26.424
<v Speaker 2>donate $100 or whatever and they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to save their child from </v>

910
00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 2>diabetes or who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

911
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.853
<v Speaker 2>they found a method a few years back </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really troubling and what the </v>

912
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:38.690
<v Speaker 2>was is they would pray on the poorest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor people and would do,</v>

913
00:37:38.691 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 2>would explain his late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>

914
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know your bills are due.</v>

915
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that you need this money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you send that money,</v>

916
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 2>God will multiply that money tenfold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd have all these people.</v>

917
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.021
<v Speaker 2>They'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

918
00:37:52.021 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rent was due,</v>

919
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 2>you know my carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to repossess my car,</v>

920
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 2>but I sent $100 and the whole audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>is clapping and cheering.</v>

921
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I give a $100 to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all this first,</v>

922
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.530
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden I hit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery ticket and a lottery ticket.</v>

923
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good Lord,</v>

924
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:07.254
<v Speaker 2>it's $500 it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus gave me $500 and everybody's </v>

925
00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:12.400
<v Speaker 2>clapping and cheering and they would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to another story.</v>

926
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got a fucking f $5,000</v>

927
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 2>suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably driving a Bentley.</v>

928
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dark.</v>

929
00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the preying on people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>just faulty mechanisms.</v>

930
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:22.524
<v Speaker 2>Their brain is not working right and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lowest possible point and then </v>

931
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you're just kicking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're down.</v>

932
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really sad.</v>

933
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>The old ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're worried about death.</v>

934
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:31.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean death is imminent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the way the body's feeling and </v>

935
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>as body's failing,</v>

936
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 3>here's some guy on television that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying a bunch of things that you know,</v>

937
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's like sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a window of,</v>

938
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 3>of cognitive function that starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>close and it's very hard to,</v>

939
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.793
<v Speaker 3>to perceive and you're on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to kind of like talk to them a </v>

940
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 3>lot to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

941
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 3>your ability to think is really clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>compromised right now.</v>

942
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

943
00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.164
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talk and they talk and they seem </v>

944
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 3>fairly normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're around them a lot,</v>

945
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 3>then you kind of get the full picture of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>

946
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 3>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those types of people,</v>

947
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:09.300
<v Speaker 3>like man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they,</v>

948
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 3>they're going to prey on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

949
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

950
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you ever get forwarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>those email chains that like people send</v>

951
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:16.804
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom is obsessed with this kind of </v>

952
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 3>stuff in her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her seventies and it just like,</v>

953
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people saying that something is a fact,</v>

954
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 3>especially in politics as well when it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just made up,</v>

955
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

956
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.663
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I got it an email and it said that </v>

957
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 3>it was from CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

958
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.180
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you click the link to,</v>

959
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:32.014
<v Speaker 3>to actually take you to CNN?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it actually should say that in the </v>

960
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:34.581
<v Speaker 3>article?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

961
00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just difficult because they believe</v>

962
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 3>anything that is on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

963
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 3>And there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously confirmation bias.</v>

964
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you could always find a form that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will tell you that the world is flat.</v>

965
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole flat earth community out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

966
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 3>They've openly mock me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're angry at me.</v>

967
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

970
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 3>if you stop and think about the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of people just in this country,</v>

<v Speaker 3>country plus,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uncle Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these fucking pictures.</v>

986
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.453
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's in on it from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time since they started </v>

987
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:37.510
<v Speaker 3>taking pictures of planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those planets,</v>

988
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 3>The sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon,</v>

989
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.503
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit just happens to be round </v>

990
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.860
<v Speaker 3>and you're not buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

991
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

992
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.260
<v Speaker 3>You just have to feel compassion for </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people then.</v>

993
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's circular.</v>

994
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>But it's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something's not right upstairs.</v>

995
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people love to be the person who</v>

996
00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

997
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.143
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on in the human </v>

998
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 3>brain or the human brain has always been</v>
<v Speaker 3>curious and we're trying to innovate and</v>

999
00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:05.254
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of the brain that has this </v>

1000
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:13.530
<v Speaker 3>insatiable desire to create better </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and to innovate and to constantly</v>

1001
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.613
<v Speaker 3>find a better way in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're always constantly searching for </v>

1002
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 3>secrets as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1003
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:21.580
<v Speaker 3>well if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it works.</v>

1004
00:41:21.581 --> 00:41:22.414
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take this flint and you're banging </v>

1005
00:41:23.911 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>it against this steel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a fire.</v>

1006
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:26.554
<v Speaker 3>So we find these things and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>always trying to find the things that </v>

1007
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 3>people are hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they hiding from us?</v>

1008
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1009
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:32.974
<v Speaker 3>And he find out about some secrets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are true and some conspiracies that </v>

1010
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 3>absolutely do exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's William Randolph hearst,</v>

1011
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>whether it's fucking Rockefeller trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep,</v>

1012
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol from being legal because he </v>

1013
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 3>wants to protect the gasoline market.</v>

1014
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.983
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these like real </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies that you find out and they </v>

1015
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 3>fuel the speculation and then they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the one that tells you,</v>

1016
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 3>you know that the sky is falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1017
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 3>They want to be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way around that.</v>

1018
00:41:58.131 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to happen until the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of days,</v>

1019
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 3>2000 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird aspect of people.</v>

1020
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's also,</v>

1021
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 3>but I bet you believe in a few of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1022
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean like what is your take on Ufo </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows?</v>

1023
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's impossible that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been visited by see no evidence.</v>

1024
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Don't think it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do think it's possible?</v>

1025
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.593
<v Speaker 3>I think it's absolutely possible that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have been visited by a life form </v>

1026
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.800
<v Speaker 3>from another planet and one point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1027
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 3>but there's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>

1028
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't think any of the photos,</v>

1029
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.453
<v Speaker 3>any of the videos and those objects </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in my possession is the thing </v>

1030
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 3>that I've seen some objects that move in</v>
<v Speaker 3>space that are fascinating.</v>

1031
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some fast.</v>

1032
00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did that jump across?</v>

1033
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing to me.</v>

1034
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:38.264
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also there's also some weird shit </v>

1035
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:41.804
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that absolutely exists that they can </v>

1036
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 3>prove on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like bald lightening.</v>

1037
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen ball lightning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1038
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.030
<v Speaker 3>This video is a ball lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul lightning is like sums,</v>

1039
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 3>weird phenomenon where lightening </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of coming down to the ground,</v>

1040
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it can fly around like a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1041
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably half of the videos.</v>

1042
00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.843
<v Speaker 3>You have a good percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them that are just </v>

1043
00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:04.240
<v Speaker 3>stars for people who are just retarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

1044
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.971
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1045
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 3>it's all like move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's been firefighters that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have launched missiles,</v>

1047
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 3>it stars planets or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there was something about that</v>

1048
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1049
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 3>people think the Venus is a spaceship </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's,</v>

1050
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 3>there's also absolutely been </v>
<v Speaker 3>experimental aircrafts,</v>

1051
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1052
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.940
<v Speaker 3>When we were filming fear factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1053
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm way out in the middle of the desert </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Palmdale,</v>

1054
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 3>which is near Edwards air force base and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the stealth bombers,</v>

1055
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:35.570
<v Speaker 3>it was like right after September 11th </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you watch those things fly over,</v>

1056
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 3>you swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in Star Wars.</v>

1057
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:37.911
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1058
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 3>that's spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darth vader lives on that,</v>

1059
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's flying that like this is,</v>

1060
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 3>this is not a person in there because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like a star ship.</v>

1061
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.191
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1062
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.024
<v Speaker 3>I spent a lot of time out in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to work at the Nevada test site </v>

1063
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:50.350
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1064
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:51.183
<v Speaker 3>area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did back way back in 2000 and you do </v>

1065
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 3>out there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1066
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I was into technology and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>

1067
00:43:58.611 --> 00:43:59.444
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of when I was studying computer </v>

1068
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:03.230
<v Speaker 3>science and so I was working out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty low level job,</v>

1069
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 3>but I had to bounce around between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>

1070
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the test side is divided into,</v>

1071
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 plus areas and like groom lake,</v>

1072
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 3>like that area lake is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's area 51 that's the best known,</v>

1073
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:16.484
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many other areas like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's different things on every </v>

1074
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:20.600
<v Speaker 3>plot of land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1075
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:22.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one called a beef,</v>

1076
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 3>which is the big explosive experimental </v>
<v Speaker 3>facility.</v>

1077
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:26.843
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of sub critical nuclear </v>

1078
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 3>testing has done underground so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't break any treaties,</v>

1079
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>but they can figure</v>

1080
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.890
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1081
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the yield based on the test that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1082
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.090
<v Speaker 1>So they can still do kind of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>

1083
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:37.924
<v Speaker 1>but it's not actually producing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still closed off all the areas </v>

1084
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 1>when they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1085
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and then there's every three letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency you could imagine,</v>

1086
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 1>rents out a piece of the test site to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests and experiments.</v>

1087
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was my job to set up all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

1088
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.263
<v Speaker 1>no Ville networking equipment between </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas so that they can talk to each </v>

1089
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was this?</v>

1090
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.640
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1091
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 1>just before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99,</v>

1092
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:00.440
<v Speaker 1>98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>98.</v>

1093
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.283
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000.</v>

1094
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.133
<v Speaker 1>What was the year where they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that that was actually a base </v>

1095
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 1>because they had to expand the area that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was forbidden to trespass on?</v>

1096
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what,</v>

1097
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 1>what was in the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had denied it forever.</v>

1098
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.890
<v Speaker 1>They did when I was there.</v>

1099
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 1>But it was so obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would go into the,</v>

1100
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird because they were just,</v>

1101
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you would go into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

1102
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:26.964
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't go to any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any area unless you had a reason to be </v>

1103
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:29.424
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also had to have a proper </v>

1104
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 1>security clearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had what was called the q clearance</v>

1105
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 1>and then even if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was top secret,</v>

1106
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 1>but even if I had top secret in less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a request.</v>

1107
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.150
<v Speaker 1>And then if I went into an area that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive information,</v>

1108
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I would also have to be escorted at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

1109
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But some of the areas that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really classified,</v>

1110
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:50.160
<v Speaker 1>they were just secret areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1111
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power facility for example,</v>

1112
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:53.723
<v Speaker 1>you'd walk in and they'd have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chilled power clearly going to groom </v>

1113
00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it would,</v>

1114
00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you could see the line going straight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>groom lake,</v>

1115
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.293
<v Speaker 1>but they would say it didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would show the line going up </v>

1116
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1117
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so silly.</v>

1118
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you even show that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the case,</v>

1119
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:07.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1120
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably feel like no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go there.</v>

1121
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.100
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1122
00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to deny it go fuck off.</v>

1123
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:16.720
<v Speaker 1>The air force took that over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1125
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the air force was running it.</v>

1126
00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was department of Energy,</v>

1127
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 1>which handles all of our nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

1128
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the air force,</v>

1129
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's extra guard gates before you get</v>

1130
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you head into mercury in Nevada,</v>

1131
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you get through one guard gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is show your badge.</v>

1132
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard comes on,</v>

1133
00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:33.474
<v Speaker 1>the bus touches your badge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at your id all if I could touches </v>

1134
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it touches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to physically touch it.</v>

1135
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a thing.</v>

1136
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have one them feel that it was real</v>

1137
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.140
<v Speaker 1>because it was just like laminated a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>

1138
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know what they had to touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1139
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once you get through the,</v>

1140
00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front gate there,</v>

1141
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.940
<v Speaker 1>then to go and do a further areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could drive out there but you,</v>

1142
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>there'd be other gates if there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret information going on between,</v>

1143
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.163
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you left and where you were </v>

1144
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:58.020
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to get to groom lake,</v>

1145
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>there was one other guard station just </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of,</v>

1146
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:02.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1147
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 1>the sedan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sedan crater.</v>

1148
00:47:03.961 --> 00:47:04.794
<v Speaker 1>If you look up sedan crater on Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this massive crater that was </v>

1149
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 1>done via nuclear test and right past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one,</v>

1150
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>one more guard station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's severely compartmentalized.</v>

1151
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.203
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1152
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a in an area can go dark and </v>

1153
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>then then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.214
<v Speaker 1>department of defense can come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take it over and just do test there for </v>

1155
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:23.364
<v Speaker 1>three months and then it's dark again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just destroy everything they </v>

1156
00:47:25.871 --> 00:47:26.704
<v Speaker 1>were working on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this massive crater from the </v>

1157
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're all over the place.</v>

1158
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So the test that is just filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>craters,</v>

1159
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.590
<v Speaker 1>craters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>

1160
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And you can stand on the edge of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a little platform there.</v>

1161
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1162
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:41.164
<v Speaker 1>they did some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pretty extensive nuclear tests out </v>

1163
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1164
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.953
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to wear a little dishonor around </v>

1165
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:51.460
<v Speaker 1>our necks and make sure you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it wasn't real time,</v>

1166
00:47:51.461 --> 00:47:52.294
<v Speaker 1>sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would send it in and get it </v>

1167
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:54.394
<v Speaker 1>analyzed afterwards and they tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much radiation exposure you had </v>

1168
00:47:56.381 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1169
00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 1>we were all going in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so mellow back then.</v>

1170
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It was already kind of all cleared out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so spooky though.</v>

1171
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.313
<v Speaker 1>It is spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these craters all over the </v>

1172
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:08.010
<v Speaker 1>place where they were just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning.</v>

1173
00:48:08.011 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Just drive up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1174
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribes would like to get out.</v>

1175
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were there,</v>

1176
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.600
<v Speaker 1>was there anything that made you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government had any knowledge of</v>

1177
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 1>extra terrestrial aircrafts?</v>

1178
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Was there any whispers of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's her?</v>

1179
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was whispers of a few things,</v>

1180
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't like Iti related stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a,</v>

1181
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it was government projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like other,</v>

1182
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 1>other secret test projects that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1183
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 1>So you think that's what a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were seeing when they're talking about,</v>

1184
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it was five flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe,</v>

1185
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 1>even though this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of anything,</v>

1186
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1187
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.723
<v Speaker 1>there was friends that we had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out in those areas and I think </v>

1188
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 1>they were experimenting just based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skill sets that were going out there</v>

1189
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 1>on a kind of antigravity related stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1190
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:00.123
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what groom lake wasn't </v>

1191
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 1>being used at that point in time for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>more research and development.</v>

1192
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:07.294
<v Speaker 1>I think all that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was all kind of underground </v>

1193
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 1>cause a lot of that is underground.</v>

1194
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It's an underground base as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's hangers out there and there's</v>

1195
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 1>a really long runway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was all for testing.</v>

1196
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 1>That was done in like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.800
<v Speaker 1>the seventies and eighties that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>done out there.</v>

1198
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go see what an </v>

1199
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 1>underground base looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1200
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 1>they must raise the state of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that.</v>

1201
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:28.924
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this is underfunded stuff </v>

1202
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.640
<v Speaker 1>really went underground one time in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the areas and they make you take this</v>

1203
00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:35.590
<v Speaker 1>respirator training before you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath there.</v>

1204
00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:36.424
<v Speaker 1>So you have to know how to use these </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency packs in case just no air in </v>

1205
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:42.040
<v Speaker 1>case there was no air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all it's really cold.</v>

1206
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It gets really cold immediately as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to go ground.</v>

1207
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1208
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you know where I was wearing a jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was,</v>

1209
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 1>it was 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1210
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 1>it was so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1211
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it was where I had to wear like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight jacket,</v>

1212
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 1>like a meat locker or like refrigerator.</v>

1213
00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Well it was once we got down in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of during the,</v>

1214
00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 1>when you go down into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shaft that was,</v>

1215
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:02.764
<v Speaker 1>that was when it was a chilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once we got in there was a little </v>

1216
00:50:05.201 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 1>bit more climate controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1217
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.820
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go down underneath the ground to do</v>

1218
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:10.654
<v Speaker 1>some of these experiments and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason why I had to go down </v>

1219
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1220
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 1>The other big thing out there is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

1221
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Daft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1222
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>device assembly facility.</v>

1223
00:50:19.781 --> 00:50:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Daff you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go with that one as well.</v>

1224
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>This is where they assembled nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons in the United States,</v>

1225
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1226
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 2>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was another fun one to check out.</v>

1227
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 2>That was a super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super guarded facility.</v>

1228
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.523
<v Speaker 2>That one was extremely hard to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these underground bases are </v>

1229
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:37.670
<v Speaker 2>underfunded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1230
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:39.800
<v Speaker 2>this one in particular was used for </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments,</v>

1231
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like a permanent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1232
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

1233
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 2>when they did the subcritical nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>

1234
00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:46.450
<v Speaker 2>they would have you go all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>

1235
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 2>They'd set up all the test equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would seal it with concrete,</v>

1236
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.000
<v Speaker 2>they would detonate it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would close off the whole,</v>

1237
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 2>so it was always locked down in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just underneath there.</v>

1238
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda just underground forever.</v>

1239
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like such a crazy way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1240
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't have the funds or you </v>

1241
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:05.270
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to go in there and dig</v>

1242
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 2>up a bunch of busted equipment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>already detonated.</v>

1243
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.611
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1244
00:51:08.611 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a halfway thought out </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1245
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.851
<v Speaker 2>Like someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1246
00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to contain the </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion?</v>

1247
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1248
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1249
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:17.143
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to blow it up and we're </v>

1250
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 2>going to seal it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1251
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they just went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody came along and go,</v>

1252
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck head.</v>

1253
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.180
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1254
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.303
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes that place like toxic for </v>

1255
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:27.300
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

1256
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1257
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>this is a facility that's the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island.</v>

1258
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's massive.</v>

1259
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.163
<v Speaker 2>There's so many wacky nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments that they did between 1940 </v>

1260
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.510
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they stopped.</v>

1261
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 2>This is one of them is the most bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called operation starfish prime,</v>

1262
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:45.980
<v Speaker 2>where they detonated a nuclear bomb in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere.</v>

1263
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:49.510
<v Speaker 2>They shot a nuclear bomb up into the Mag</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nino's fear just to kind of,</v>

1264
00:51:49.511 --> 00:51:50.490
<v Speaker 2>to see what it had happened.</v>

1265
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to see what would happen.</v>

1266
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their experiment,</v>

1267
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:56.234
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would have to actually talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the original scientists because then </v>

1268
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we know about it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking insane,</v>

1269
00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:03.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this,</v>

1270
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:04.184
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shot it like up into the van Allen </v>

1271
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:08.960
<v Speaker 2>radiation belts and just launched a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bomb up there.</v>

1272
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know to see if they could blow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole through it.</v>

1273
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 2>This was when they were doing manned </v>
<v Speaker 2>space missions too,</v>

1274
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.030
<v Speaker 2>so they might have been trying to blow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>

1275
00:52:17.031 --> 00:52:17.864
<v Speaker 2>so to make it less radiation up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're sending astronauts through </v>

1276
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:22.094
<v Speaker 2>it like crazy and who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they didn't know what </v>

1277
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 2>was going to happen and they decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try it anyway,</v>

1278
00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.001
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1279
00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 2>we'll just shoot a fucking megaton bomb </v>
<v Speaker 2>up into the atmosphere.</v>

1280
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 2>The worst case scenario though is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

1281
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really,</v>

1282
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.841
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1283
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

1284
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking a million people die of </v>

1285
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 2>cancer or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1286
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:42.670
<v Speaker 2>who the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this one asking?</v>

1287
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Is that real picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says that operation,</v>

1288
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.650
<v Speaker 2>is starfish happened during operation or</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you say starfish?</v>

1289
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Starfish prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called during operation.</v>

1290
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Dominic and his picture pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1291
00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:55.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably real.</v>

1292
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.533
<v Speaker 2>I mean they did so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one of my favorite ones of all time </v>

1293
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 2>was one where they did it in the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they really didn't know what kind of</v>

1294
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 2>a reaction they would have inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean from a nuclear bottle.</v>

1295
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They video footage of that.</v>

1296
00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.011
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1297
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1298
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>See if you could see that detonated </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bomb in the ocean to find that,</v>

1299
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:15.650
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

1300
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It was beyond what they thought the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact is going to be like.</v>

1301
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:21.670
<v Speaker 2>They actually had bowel shipstation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1302
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I saw them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll ship wrecked me.</v>

1303
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.093
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people died and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know if there was even people on </v>

1304
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 2>those battleships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were telling me ships.</v>

1305
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was hopefully,</v>

1306
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when it happened,</v>

1307
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

1308
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean that water goes a mile high up </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the sky.</v>

1309
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the best video.</v>

1310
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.353
<v Speaker 2>There's a way better video where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bunch of ships around it and you </v>

1311
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:50.300
<v Speaker 2>see the ships just get overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water airs.</v>

1312
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.143
<v Speaker 2>One of them look at that like there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a perspective shot cause you </v>

1313
00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 2>kind of get a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fuck man,</v>

1314
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.650
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power is insane and nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombs are way more insane.</v>

1315
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:08.130
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you're going to split </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams and it's going to cause a reaction</v>

1316
00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:13.131
<v Speaker 2>that is just so almost inconceivably </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful to the average person.</v>

1317
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Like what could be when we have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a metric in our head about,</v>

1318
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>okay this is a firecracker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1319
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 2>And then this is an mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here's,</v>

1320
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 2>here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah this is the big one.</v>

1321
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mile into the air.</v>

1322
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is an mat,</v>

1323
00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 2>here is a stick of dynamite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1324
00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 2>here's a nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh well it's just,</v>

1325
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:39.660
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so exponentially more powerful than</v>

1326
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 2>anything that we can kind of wrap our </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains around.</v>

1327
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 2>And this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1328
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>what was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what year was this shaming?</v>

1329
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.553
<v Speaker 2>This happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1950 [inaudible] 58 imagine what they </v>

1330
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1331
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2016 version of that,</v>

1332
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just no more water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1333
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 2>The oceans gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>the ocean becomes a Sahara desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1335
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1336
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 2>humans are bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1337
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 2>We're a weird little animal.</v>

1338
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.573
<v Speaker 2>And how long did you work out there at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this test facility that was out there </v>

1339
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:13.740
<v Speaker 2>for about two and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close to three years.</v>

1340
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Were you familiar at all with Robert </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lasar?</v>

1341
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about that?</v>

1342
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that he was a contractor and</v>

1343
00:55:20.611 --> 00:55:22.660
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story wasn't all that right.</v>

1344
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that the area he talks about s </v>

1345
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 2>three I heard that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a real thing.</v>

1346
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about his stories.</v>

1347
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing was a folding space and </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and yeah,</v>

1348
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1349
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:38.484
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of those guys that if you're a </v>

1350
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 2>dummy and you listened to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1351
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well he makes it,</v>

1352
00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>he's making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he seemed so confident.</v>

1353
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:48.174
<v Speaker 2>Like I listened to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck he saying </v>

1354
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:50.843
<v Speaker 2>like he's talking about magnetic drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm a dummy so I'm listening to </v>

1355
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:54.174
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this magnetic drive talk and talking </v>

1356
00:55:55.711 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 2>about these space ships and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1357
00:55:57.241 --> 00:55:58.370
<v Speaker 2>this guy is telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1358
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

1359
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if I was a real physicist and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to him and be like up to this.</v>

1360
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you saw,</v>

1361
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:06.390
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

1362
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work like that.</v>

1363
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 2>You just have him on the show with yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with exactly.</v>

1364
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if he gives it </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews anymore.</v>

1365
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean I haven't heard about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1366
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a,</v>

1367
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 2>they were saying he was a contractor </v>
<v Speaker 2>working for,</v>

1368
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 2>was it dod or something like that or</v>

1369
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird because he was never in any</v>

1370
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 3>of the official like catalogs of books </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>

1371
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So his story is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1372
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:32.813
<v Speaker 3>we'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys is a guy named Stanton </v>

1373
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Freedman who's one of the premiere uff </v>
<v Speaker 3>ologists.</v>

1374
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:41.270
<v Speaker 3>He's actually like a highly educated guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very skeptical,</v>

1375
00:56:41.271 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 3>but most ufo claims was still believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

1376
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.243
<v Speaker 3>He did some research into the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>background and believes that he lied </v>

1377
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:53.260
<v Speaker 3>about his education and lied about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>different places that he worked.</v>

1378
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 3>But I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1379
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1380
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.390
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to,</v>

1381
00:56:58.450 --> 00:56:59.283
<v Speaker 3>to pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those things where </v>

1382
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:01.991
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1383
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really going to get a resolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1384
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>

1385
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the once a year,</v>

1386
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.860
<v Speaker 3>1130 at night youtube video fest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1387
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:11.703
<v Speaker 3>To sit back and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched like three hours of youtube </v>

1388
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:15.184
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

1389
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1390
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:16.943
<v Speaker 3>Ufos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I go to bed and the next day </v>

1391
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 3>and then it happens again in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1392
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:21.063
<v Speaker 3>well I think for sure it's possible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's life out there in the universe </v>

1393
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:26.883
<v Speaker 3>that is as intelligent as us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also possible that we're the </v>

1394
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:32.560
<v Speaker 3>only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why I think it's possible</v>

1395
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:33.394
<v Speaker 3>that we're the only ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hundreds of millions of life </v>

1396
00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:35.484
<v Speaker 3>forms on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're the only one with an atoll </v>

1397
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 3>where the only one with iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the only one that knows how to use</v>

1398
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the only one out of these hundreds</v>

1399
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 3>of millions of life forms on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>goldilocks planet.</v>

1400
00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:46.271
<v Speaker 3>It would make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1401
00:57:46.271 --> 00:57:47.104
<v Speaker 3>you mean that up just our pos planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were saying out of all planets </v>

1402
00:57:50.021 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 3>were the only ones that use an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1403
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>well that kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We kind of invented it,</v>

1404
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 3>but I mean out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this planet,</v>

1405
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:57.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we go into the fucking </v>

1406
00:57:58.631 --> 00:57:59.464
<v Speaker 3>Congo and we find some strange species </v>
<v Speaker 3>that knows how to send emails to each </v>

1407
00:58:02.141 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1408
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the only one and then again,</v>

1409
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 3>dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do weird shit with each other.</v>

1410
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:08.884
<v Speaker 3>They can talk and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can only that you can't do most of </v>

1411
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1412
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand what they're saying,</v>

1413
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.710
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of weird because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be top being here.</v>

1414
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Are you familiar at all with John Lilly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1415
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 3>John Lilly's the guy who created the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory deprivation tank.</v>

1416
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

1417
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 3>And he was also a pioneer of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interspecies communication.</v>

1418
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:29.790
<v Speaker 3>He used to do acid and get in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1419
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 3>so keep your deprivation tank next to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphin tank and he tried to communicate</v>

1420
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:36.350
<v Speaker 3>with the dolphins and his did that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1421
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it kind of could probably</v>

1422
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:39.484
<v Speaker 3>kind of good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe at the moment while he was </v>

1423
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:43.894
<v Speaker 3>tripping balls floating and hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably kind of got a sense of what </v>

1424
00:58:51.581 --> 00:58:52.414
<v Speaker 3>they were saying.</v>

1425
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I was in a tank once and I swore that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an experience that,</v>

1426
00:58:57.731 --> 00:59:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean the imagination is a very strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1427
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:01.984
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine imagination is very weird </v>

1428
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 3>because it's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think of the imagination,</v>

1429
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.131
<v Speaker 3>you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1430
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 3>he's making things up in his mind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't real.</v>

1431
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.633
<v Speaker 3>That's like the standard way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the imagination and really like </v>

1432
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:16.930
<v Speaker 3>pragmatic hard nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would go,</v>

1433
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all he's doing is sitting around all day</v>

1434
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.663
<v Speaker 3>imagining things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But imagination is responsible for that </v>

1435
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 3>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this computer,</v>

1436
00:59:24.741 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 3>the coffee mugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to you ceramics,</v>

1437
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:28.214
<v Speaker 3>microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every fucking object on earth is all </v>

1438
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:31.184
<v Speaker 3>created out of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was in a sensory deprivation tank </v>

1439
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>and I had this experience where I was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungle.</v>

1440
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.843
<v Speaker 3>And not only was I listening to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people speak this strange language but </v>

1441
00:59:44.851 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 3>are still understood.</v>

1442
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.920
<v Speaker 3>You were not an Ios guy or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1443
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I was high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was on.</v>

1444
00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.413
<v Speaker 3>It was most likely edible po edible pod </v>
<v Speaker 3>is my drug of choice in sensory </v>

1445
00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:57.660
<v Speaker 3>deprivation tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think um,</v>

1446
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.593
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll pop first of all is one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most underrated psychedelic </v>

1447
01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:02.114
<v Speaker 3>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think people don't realize that </v>

1448
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:05.864
<v Speaker 3>there is a profound difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>thc and what happens when your liver </v>

1449
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 3>processes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is 11 hydroxy metabolite,</v>

1450
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 3>which is four to five times more </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive than thc.</v>

1451
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.393
<v Speaker 3>Which is why a lot of people think when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat pot cookies that it was laced </v>

1452
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.710
<v Speaker 3>and something was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1453
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:22.340
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1454
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens when you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis.</v>

1455
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 3>That's what's responsible for the vedic </v>
<v Speaker 3>texts.</v>

1456
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.480
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the ancient Hindu uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>documents like all of their,</v>

1457
01:00:31.481 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Yogi practices.</v>

1458
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I was a lot of that was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating hash.</v>

1459
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:37.663
<v Speaker 3>Really eating hash has been a tradition </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst people for thousands and </v>

1460
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.233
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat the hash like this sticky hash that </v>

1461
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat that for sure.</v>

1462
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:48.644
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke it because it's already been </v>

1463
01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 3>broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1464
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.880
<v Speaker 3>well especially when you cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cook it in something fat soluble and</v>

1465
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 3>then you then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you eat it.</v>

1466
01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1467
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.493
<v Speaker 3>And even in candy form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how they're making </v>

1468
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're eating it,</v>

1469
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's whatever it is that allows your </v>

1470
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:07.784
<v Speaker 3>body to process it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you do that inside a sensory </v>

1471
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:13.520
<v Speaker 3>deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on a a pretty decent size dose,</v>

1472
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 3>you have some wild ass experience bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of mine was,</v>

1473
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I was in the jungle and I was with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1474
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:23.090
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these indigenous people and whatever,</v>

1475
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:24.260
<v Speaker 3>wherever this jungle was.</v>

1476
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.393
<v Speaker 3>And they were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not only did I understand what they </v>

1477
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:31.100
<v Speaker 3>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was thinking in their language.</v>

1478
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.560
<v Speaker 3>It was very brief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very brief.</v>

1479
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.573
<v Speaker 3>And then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I realized what I was doing </v>

1480
01:01:36.051 --> 01:01:36.884
<v Speaker 3>that I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could never bring myself back to </v>

1481
01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:40.670
<v Speaker 3>that state again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember that this experience,</v>

1482
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 3>which probably only lasted a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes at most,</v>

1483
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.640
<v Speaker 3>was sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange.</v>

1484
01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:47.474
<v Speaker 3>And I was trying to think like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like some sort of like a deeply </v>

1485
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:57.161
<v Speaker 3>tucked away genetic memory from back </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know the great,</v>

1486
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:00.230
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great ancestors of whoever was,</v>

1487
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:01.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have to think any person that's </v>

1488
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 3>alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>

1489
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 3>your genes must be traced back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient people.</v>

1490
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way.</v>

1491
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:14.810
<v Speaker 3>You didn't get come out of a fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>three d printer six weeks ago.</v>

1492
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:18.590
<v Speaker 3>You are a product of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of years of life.</v>

1493
01:02:18.591 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that is the case,</v>

1494
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.200
<v Speaker 3>some of that is probably tucked away </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside your jeans.</v>

1495
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this guy named trick.</v>

1496
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:30.953
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible that there are </v>

1497
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 3>little like you know how sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will bring something up,</v>

1498
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will say,</v>

1499
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:37.764
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember that guy who went to high </v>

1500
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 3>school with and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

1501
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.094
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike and then you remember Mike's Weird </v>

1502
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:47.280
<v Speaker 3>car and you remember Mike's Girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>who beat him up and had that person.</v>

1503
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I've given you that cue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have been gone forever.</v>

1504
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are folders and one of the</v>

1505
01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 3>reasons why I say this is because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1506
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a very obvious folders.</v>

1507
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Like when I'm talking about certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1508
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 3>like say if we're talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1509
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:07.620
<v Speaker 3>whatever psychedelic drugs or monkeys or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1510
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it's like my mind has like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that they can draw upon.</v>

1511
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.193
<v Speaker 3>But if you bring up something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>normally would be very knowledgeable </v>

1512
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe mixed martial arts,</v>

1513
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 3>like start asking me about certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights are fighters.</v>

1514
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:20.701
<v Speaker 3>I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1515
01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:21.534
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I was commentating on a UFC and </v>

1516
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 3>it came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be there for me.</v>

1517
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.340
<v Speaker 3>It'd be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that folder would be,</v>

1518
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.753
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be able to access it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just take it saying it takes a </v>

1519
01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>little while for the folder to get open </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

1520
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes like that has to be your point</v>
<v Speaker 3>of focus.</v>

1521
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand memory entirely.</v>

1522
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:43.041
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily understand how it </v>
<v Speaker 3>works and how it varies so much.</v>

1523
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Like there's sometimes where like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>does that fucking word?</v>

1524
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 3>What's that fucking word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it comes out and go,</v>

1525
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could I forget that?</v>

1526
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens all the time and it's,</v>

1527
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>it's worse as you get older too.</v>

1528
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened to me my whole life?</v>

1529
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's gotten any better or </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

1530
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:57.703
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always been that thing like what's </v>

1531
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.054
<v Speaker 3>that fucking word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then someone will say it and he's </v>

1532
01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1533
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is that like?</v>

1534
01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Why is memory variable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1535
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:12.321
<v Speaker 3>why has it come and why is it go and why</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it enhanced by certain compounds like</v>

1536
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 3>per acetone and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

1537
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:15.564
<v Speaker 3>Coleen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like certain different things </v>

1538
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:17.634
<v Speaker 3>that will enhance your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to memorize things or </v>

1539
01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:21.030
<v Speaker 3>remember things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recall things.</v>

1540
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:26.420
<v Speaker 3>But I think that it's got to be possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somewhere deep,</v>

1541
01:04:26.551 --> 01:04:30.720
<v Speaker 3>deep down in our DNA or genome or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1542
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.360
<v Speaker 3>There's some memories like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think those,</v>

1543
01:04:33.361 --> 01:04:35.700
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those memories are instincts </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1544
01:04:35.701 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rupert sheldrake,</v>

1545
01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:38.790
<v Speaker 3>who's a guy who's been on this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1546
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:39.624
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like evolutionary biologist or </v>

1547
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:42.024
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1548
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:43.450
<v Speaker 3>One of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1549
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:44.423
<v Speaker 3>theories was about why children who live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in cities or afraid of monsters and he </v>

1550
01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:50.244
<v Speaker 3>thinks that there is a deep seated </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic memory of us being preyed upon </v>

1551
01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:57.120
<v Speaker 3>by cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Jaguars and leopards and things along</v>

1552
01:04:57.121 --> 01:04:57.811
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1553
01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.580
<v Speaker 3>back when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1554
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.433
<v Speaker 3>less evolved hominids and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in the trees and that these cats </v>

1555
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:05.514
<v Speaker 3>are jack and us and they do it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we're terrified of the </v>

1556
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.670
<v Speaker 3>night and the darkness and monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1557
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 3>we think kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in their cities.</v>

1558
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:12.594
<v Speaker 3>They should be scared about bullets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime and car accidents and train </v>

1559
01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:17.064
<v Speaker 3>derailments and things that are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably will be in several thousand </v>

1560
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 3>years once we'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1561
01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:23.590
<v Speaker 3>That's becomes a part of the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1562
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

1563
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:25.894
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1564
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:27.003
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1565
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I found that experience being in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>

1566
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:31.323
<v Speaker 3>It was so real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what was bizarre and it easily </v>

1567
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 3>could be marijuana plus imagination plus</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory deprivation creates this.</v>

1568
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1569
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.300
<v Speaker 3>that's a good comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1570
01:05:41.301 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1571
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about Iowaska and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these other,</v>

1572
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 3>it seems like that's the hot thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's doing these days.</v>

1573
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time.</v>

1574
01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Ethel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tryptamine right.</v>

1575
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would ask is if chemo </v>

1576
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 3>smoke that on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1577
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.380
<v Speaker 3>I've swiped it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1578
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.300
<v Speaker 3>you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:57.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done Iowasca because I've </v>

1580
01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:00.094
<v Speaker 3>never found anybody that's willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get it to me without going to the </v>

1581
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:03.030
<v Speaker 3>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1582
01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.913
<v Speaker 3>you got to do the ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the DMT experiencing itself is </v>

1583
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just dmt itself is,</v>

1584
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.953
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a more powerful version of Iowasca </v>

1585
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 3>like Iowasca from what it's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to me,</v>

1586
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:22.651
<v Speaker 3>for everyone who's done it is longer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes more introspective and it can</v>

1587
01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:26.650
<v Speaker 3>be more profound even because it lasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer and you have more time to sort of</v>

1588
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 3>take in the experience.</v>

1589
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.820
<v Speaker 3>But as far as the intensity of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1590
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:31.654
<v Speaker 3>it's not as intense as when you smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt Andrew's day and smoking dmt is not </v>

1591
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:37.564
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as powerful as when it's </v>

1592
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.933
<v Speaker 3>injected intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how they did it with Doctor </v>

1593
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Rick strassman under the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico did a series of tests,</v>

1594
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:47.914
<v Speaker 3>clinical trials on plank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he documented it in a book called </v>

1595
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule.</v>

1596
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:53.883
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a documentary on that as </v>

1597
01:06:54.851 --> 01:06:55.421
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I narrated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1599
01:06:56.771 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 3>you tell the host of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>

1601
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1602
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.233
<v Speaker 3>it's a really interesting documentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it deals with a lot of </v>

1603
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:04.384
<v Speaker 3>scientists and their experience with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with dimethyltryptamine and trying to </v>

1604
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 3>understand like what this compound is </v>
<v Speaker 3>and why it exists,</v>

1605
01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>but the trips that people had when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took it intravenously,</v>

1606
01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:15.334
<v Speaker 3>we're like half hour long just journeys </v>
<v Speaker 3>into insanity into this like bad </v>

1607
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:23.704
<v Speaker 3>insanity.</v>

1608
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.371
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1609
01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:25.810
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them,</v>

1610
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I believe afterwards said that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>profoundly enhanced their life and their</v>

1611
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:35.191
<v Speaker 3>perspective and gave them a view of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality that forever change the way they</v>

1612
01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:40.120
<v Speaker 3>look at things about interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and,</v>

1613
01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.130
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say that about myself,</v>

1614
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:42.964
<v Speaker 3>like my experiences with dmt have </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely profoundly changed the way I </v>

1615
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:47.584
<v Speaker 3>view possibility because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossibly dynamic and insane and it </v>

1616
01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:56.620
<v Speaker 3>just doesn't seem like anything that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have ever imagined.</v>

1617
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.323
<v Speaker 3>And what I Wasa is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an orally active version of DMT </v>

1618
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 3>because DMT is insanely common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1619
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.793
<v Speaker 3>It's in thousands of different plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in all sorts of different </v>

1620
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 3>ecosystems all over the world have </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants that have DMT,</v>

1621
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 3>including a lot of grasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like full Eris grasses,</v>

1622
01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>which is really common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rich and tmt.</v>

1623
01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't extract it.</v>

1624
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't extract it for sure.</v>

1625
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.283
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to just know what you're </v>

1626
01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a chemist,</v>

1627
01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 3>it's actually not that difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a reason why DMT,</v>

1628
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 3>if you know people who know how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>DMT,</v>

1629
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.093
<v Speaker 3>the actual raw plants that's have dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't make illegal because there's </v>

1630
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:39.290
<v Speaker 3>too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1631
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like you would have to make like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the,</v>

1632
01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:42.224
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some scholars out of Jerusalem </v>

1633
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.533
<v Speaker 3>that believe that this is the literal </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of what Moses was </v>

1634
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:49.244
<v Speaker 3>experiencing when experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when experiencing the burning Bush and </v>

1635
01:08:52.401 --> 01:08:53.234
<v Speaker 3>talking to God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe that burning Bush is the </v>

1636
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:55.934
<v Speaker 3>acacia tree because the Acacia tree is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very rich and dmt and extremely common </v>

1637
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 3>in that part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was Moses smoking most likely,</v>

1638
01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 3>like if you smoke the Acacia tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get the DMT?</v>

1639
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:08.894
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if you light those trees on </v>

1640
01:09:10.371 --> 01:09:11.204
<v Speaker 3>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to absorb a certain </v>

1641
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.240
<v Speaker 3>quantity of DMT.</v>

1642
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:19.450
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be as pure as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting it in a lab,</v>

1643
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.070
<v Speaker 3>breaking it down to the Rod dmt </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystals.</v>

1644
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Then freebasing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you do.</v>

1645
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.880
<v Speaker 3>That's probably way more intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's entirely likely that there is a</v>

1646
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 3>method of doing it because the method </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they found in the Amazon,</v>

1647
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely convoluted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what they did was when you,</v>

1648
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.200
<v Speaker 3>when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat a plant right that has dmt in</v>

1649
01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces something called Mano</v>

1650
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Amy and oxidase that breaks down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dime.</v>

1651
01:09:43.021 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Ethel tryptamine in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the plant and you won't,</v>

1652
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 3>you won't experience it like eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd,</v>

1653
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>it does nothing unless it's been already</v>
<v Speaker 3>pre broken down,</v>

1654
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.533
<v Speaker 3>but even more different because we'd has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like cooked in something in order </v>

1655
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 3>to activate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you just eat it straight up,</v>

1656
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 3>just like the plant itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't feel anything.</v>

1657
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

1658
01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to really good for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1659
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 3>If you eat like juicing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>juicing it like it's supposed to be like</v>

1660
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 3>really rich in phytonutrients and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be really rich and CBDS too,</v>

1661
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:11.144
<v Speaker 3>which don't necessarily get you high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a really good for you and good for </v>

1662
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was seeing it.</v>

1663
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big thing,</v>

1664
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:18.260
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People juice it.</v>

1665
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really super common.</v>

1666
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Like wheat grass juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they do it with cannabis.</v>

1667
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 3>They take the leaves and they throw it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and choose her.</v>

1668
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 3>You get those at like the dispensaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

1669
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1670
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it online.</v>

1671
01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I've never actually seen it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely have seen it online.</v>

1672
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.663
<v Speaker 3>So what these people have done when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>created Iowasca and they've been doing </v>

1673
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:35.390
<v Speaker 3>this for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knows how long,</v>

1674
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 3>but they believe it's been thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>

1675
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how long they've been doing it.</v>

1676
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:44.750
<v Speaker 3>But they take the leaf of one plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>which contains harming,</v>

1677
01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:45.584
<v Speaker 3>which is a natural Mao inhibitor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they take the roots or the vine of </v>

1678
01:10:49.101 --> 01:10:49.934
<v Speaker 3>another plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has the dimethyltryptamine in it </v>

1679
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:55.030
<v Speaker 3>and they boil it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sort of a that process.</v>

1680
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.593
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out how to make their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own pharmacological solution to love </v>

1681
01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 3>absorbing dmt orally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

1682
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Well they say the plants told them how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>

1683
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Of course they said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's wrong.</v>

1684
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think our,</v>

1685
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 3>our view of what</v>

1686
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>a plant is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1687
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to my firm,</v>

1688
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:17.483
<v Speaker 2>it never says anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a plant that's in a fucking </v>

1689
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:20.124
<v Speaker 2>plastic cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably analogous to the </v>

1690
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:25.104
<v Speaker 2>difference between that little tiny pig </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a little baby pig and a </v>

1691
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking wild paid who's out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>hustling,</v>

1692
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>making shit happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1693
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:35.783
<v Speaker 2>there's a picture I met money put up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my instagram a few days ago of a wild </v>

1694
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:42.810
<v Speaker 2>boar running off of the fon and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

1695
01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:44.560
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1696
01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a very shocking picture because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think of pigs as being predators.</v>

1697
01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.813
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are opportunities and they </v>

1698
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 2>absolutely will prey on something if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can catch it.</v>

1699
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:58.700
<v Speaker 2>But that image is like as far removed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum from that little pig,</v>

1700
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>that little tiny pig that's got a guitar</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his lap,</v>

1701
01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look at this thing.</v>

1702
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bore and that is a,</v>

1703
01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:07.670
<v Speaker 2>that that picks that playing guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.513
<v Speaker 2>And that's America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bore in America running off of </v>

1705
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:12.950
<v Speaker 2>the deer farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's its,</v>

1706
01:12:12.951 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its mouth that the spores are big,</v>

1707
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get enormous,</v>

1708
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 2>they get enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1709
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:21.510
<v Speaker 2>there's ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1710
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.373
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've caught them or kill them that </v>

1711
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>pushing a thousand pounds out there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild.</v>

1713
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1714
01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that is a wild animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1715
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:32.663
<v Speaker 2>and I think these wild plants that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the jungle that are alive in </v>

1716
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:38.274
<v Speaker 2>the rain forest and had been there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years and this deep canopy </v>

1717
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:42.624
<v Speaker 2>of moisture and nutrients and plants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs and mammals and cats and all these </v>

1718
01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:47.784
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you got these people who live </v>

1719
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Toumani,</v>

1720
01:12:51.841 --> 01:12:52.674
<v Speaker 2>they're walking barefoot through these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking woods and Bolivia and throwing </v>

1721
01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 2>fucking spears at monkeys and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking them over the fire.</v>

1722
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Like these people have been living like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for thousands of years.</v>

1723
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.000
<v Speaker 2>They're eating cocoa leaves and tripping</v>
<v Speaker 2>their balls off monthly fun cookies.</v>

1724
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be pretty awesome.</v>

1725
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never tried it before?</v>

1726
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I've had the t yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had the coca demato tea,</v>

1727
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.940
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't shut the fuck up.</v>

1728
01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like that aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The leaves are legal.</v>

1729
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:19.500
<v Speaker 2>You can buy the leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

1730
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him on a Amazon actually.</v>

1731
01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they was fucking dea hustle.</v>

1732
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Well you need the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1733
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.640
<v Speaker 2>they had the compound to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of that uh,</v>

1734
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.500
<v Speaker 2>lime or these baking soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baking soda.</v>

1735
01:13:31.501 --> 01:13:32.334
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just chew it and basically </v>

1736
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's supposed to be better for you.</v>

1737
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 2>And it also has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually like a healthy plant.</v>

1738
01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:39.940
<v Speaker 2>The phytonutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1739
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.793
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vitamins from the actual leaves of </v>

1740
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:43.350
<v Speaker 2>the plant itself actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

1741
01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually chewing some with a </v>

1742
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 2>doctor friend of mine and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1743
01:13:46.681 --> 01:13:47.250
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1744
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 2>so you could just order it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1745
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you can just order it and you just start</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordering a Jeremy,</v>

1746
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a podcast with a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking baseball sized cha.</v>

1747
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:56.970
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put like a little wad in your mouth that</v>

1748
01:13:56.971 --> 01:13:57.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1749
01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.853
<v Speaker 2>the conversation started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely possible that </v>

1750
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 2>these people that are eating plants that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have psychedelic properties to them,</v>

1751
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:06.923
<v Speaker 2>whether it's mushrooms and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of mushrooms that you can </v>

1752
01:14:09.691 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>eat that and also in the same areas with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of</v>

1753
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>silicide been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

1754
01:14:13.511 --> 01:14:14.344
<v Speaker 1>they're chewing these siliciden </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and they have these ideas of </v>

1755
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:17.764
<v Speaker 1>iconic combined these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about hundreds of </v>

1756
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:21.724
<v Speaker 1>different species of plants and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guys have figured out how to </v>

1757
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:24.574
<v Speaker 1>take these two and combine them in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really crazy involved way where you </v>

1758
01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>boiling it and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the explanation?</v>

1759
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:33.693
<v Speaker 1>There's no explanation that makes any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense other than the plants gave them </v>

1760
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:38.531
<v Speaker 1>the hints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1761
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that I've always believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've my,</v>

1762
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.733
<v Speaker 1>my wife's a neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we talk about this stuff a lot in </v>

1763
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>debate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've always believed that,</v>

1764
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know about the senses that we've </v>

1765
01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:49.654
<v Speaker 1>documented and I think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things that we can take the </v>

1766
01:14:52.511 --> 01:14:53.344
<v Speaker 1>activate other senses that we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know were there and allow us to do </v>

1767
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

1768
01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 1>talk to plants or whatever it may be.</v>

1769
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1770
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a conversation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking back to me.</v>

1771
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:05.914
<v Speaker 1>But it could be a feeling or a vibe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know some way of anything else </v>

1772
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.500
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1773
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.423
<v Speaker 1>we'll do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when scientists first found harming and </v>

1774
01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:16.114
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say this was in the early 19 </v>

1775
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what you,</v>

1776
01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:22.990
<v Speaker 1>what year it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they first found harming,</v>

1777
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.860
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to call it telepathy mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1778
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:27.694
<v Speaker 1>I think it was psychiatry is Veritas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the plan that they </v>

1779
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 1>found it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the plant,</v>

1780
01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they found that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1781
01:15:33.221 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compound,</v>

1782
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:38.230
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had allowed these people,</v>

1783
01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:39.093
<v Speaker 1>these scientists to feel like they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing some sort of communal </v>

1784
01:15:43.511 --> 01:15:47.370
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and so they wanted to call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathy,</v>

1785
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.633
<v Speaker 1>but because of the fact that once they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had isolated the compound figured out </v>

1786
01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:52.564
<v Speaker 1>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that had already been </v>

1787
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>named harming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1788
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:59.160
<v Speaker 1>due to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules of scientific nomenclature and</v>

1789
01:15:59.161 --> 01:15:59.994
<v Speaker 1>they decided to just keep that name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their name for it was going to be </v>

1790
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>telepathy.</v>

1791
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Raisie yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to hear it?</v>

1792
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a somewhat related topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1793
01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1794
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:14.370
<v Speaker 1>someone that I met that has a startup </v>
<v Speaker 1>that catalogs people's dreams,</v>

1795
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.053
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fill out like a little small </v>

1796
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:21.580
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire after they have a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that they've discovered.</v>

1797
01:16:21.581 --> 01:16:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that they've published this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or come out with any data,</v>

1798
01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:24.844
<v Speaker 1>released it publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are dreaming the same thing </v>

1799
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.110
<v Speaker 1>on the same night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1800
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing.</v>

1801
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And so like in like masses of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the same dream.</v>

1802
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1803
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:37.953
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like over a beer that we had </v>

1804
01:16:39.251 --> 01:16:40.750
<v Speaker 1>this conversation at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a party.</v>

1805
01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So I need to get back to them and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get this data out there.</v>

1806
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious as to what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1807
01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wild.</v>

1808
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.331
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1809
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 1>so how many people they're studying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1810
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.433
<v Speaker 1>it's not as official study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like an app for people that </v>

1811
01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:56.820
<v Speaker 1>like to catalog and keep track of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

1812
01:16:56.821 --> 01:17:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So he's looking at it in aggregate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding these patterns.</v>

1813
01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 1>So they recorded at nightly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1814
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>like you wake up in the morning and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you write down,</v>

1815
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I dropped about sharks eating dolphins </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>

1816
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>and then they're seeing patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>large groups.</v>

1817
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.813
<v Speaker 3>It's really trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative dreams or like a gigantic </v>

1818
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:14.144
<v Speaker 3>Sydney Opolis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could pick which movie you go </v>

1819
01:17:16.191 --> 01:17:17.024
<v Speaker 3>into and there's a bunch of other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the movie with you watching the same </v>

1820
01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really weird,</v>

1821
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.700
<v Speaker 3>but also like movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some thinking.</v>

1822
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Others thinking it's shit.</v>

1823
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1824
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>incredibly subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really a truck man.</v>

1825
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is God damn crazy.</v>

1826
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:34.303
<v Speaker 3>If that turns out to be something today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover and that starts getting </v>

1827
01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 3>expanded upon and people start really </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing this up on a regular basis,</v>

1828
01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 3>we find out that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real hard data.</v>

1829
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a game changer that would be.</v>

1830
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1831
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever taken things before you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bed to enhance dreams?</v>

1832
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1833
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna give you something before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave.</v>

1834
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:55.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried Alpha brain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1836
01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Alpha brain is a nootropic and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this company on it.</v>

1837
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.883
<v Speaker 3>My company produces coal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have double blind placebo controlled </v>

1838
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:05.054
<v Speaker 3>studies showing that from the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>center memory sewing that enhances </v>

1839
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 3>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhances executive function,</v>

1840
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 3>enhances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1841
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 3>reaction time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1842
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Also that your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts your body in an Alpha state.</v>

1843
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.083
<v Speaker 3>It puts your mind in Alpha state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the big things from it is if </v>

1844
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 3>you take it before you go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives you lucid dreams,</v>

1845
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 3>like really vivid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way I describe it as an,</v>

1846
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I try not to take it sometimes before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to bed,</v>

1847
01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:29.840
<v Speaker 3>just cause I don't want to wake up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of night,</v>

1848
01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:32.310
<v Speaker 3>freaked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to pay then can't go back to bed.</v>

1849
01:18:32.311 --> 01:18:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sleep is precious to me.</v>

1850
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I need at least six hours to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>functional.</v>

1851
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the same way.</v>

1852
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.710
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1853
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I preserve that sleep.</v>

1854
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:42.363
<v Speaker 3>I guarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you tracking it with like a fitbit </v>

1855
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:45.310
<v Speaker 3>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You No.</v>

1856
01:18:45.311 --> 01:18:46.420
<v Speaker 3>And just sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1857
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I sleep well but I'm really like </v>
<v Speaker 3>diligent about it so I don't,</v>

1858
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:52.063
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't go online late at night and </v>

1859
01:18:53.921 --> 01:18:54.754
<v Speaker 3>freak myself out if I know I have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bed and I'm not going to like watch </v>

1860
01:18:57.231 --> 01:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>animal attacks or some fucking cops </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting some kid and just tripping out,</v>

1861
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh absolutely.</v>

1862
01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be a two hour window for me</v>

1863
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 3>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to not do electronics and get flux</v>

1864
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure you already have.</v>

1865
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 3>What does flux?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a for your laptop.</v>

1866
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.450
<v Speaker 3>It shuts off all the blue light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

1867
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1868
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:15.734
<v Speaker 3>so also apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a introduce this in the latest </v>

1869
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:18.374
<v Speaker 3>version of Ios you can turn on and takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the blue light out flux does it </v>

1870
01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:21.380
<v Speaker 3>for the laptop.</v>

1871
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so at sunset this,</v>

1872
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 3>the screen starts to remove all the blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>light and it just,</v>

1873
01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:27.123
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying it helps you sleep </v>

1874
01:19:27.681 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I found that was the case.</v>

1875
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this,</v>

1876
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1877
01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:32.264
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this futurist convention in New York </v>

1878
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few back a few years back,</v>

1879
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>2042,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that a,</v>

1880
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:43.280
<v Speaker 3>in 2042,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1881
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 3>that's the going to be the year that </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence takes off.</v>

1882
01:19:46.941 --> 01:19:51.500
<v Speaker 3>And there was all these Weirdos that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were creating these robots so they could</v>

1883
01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:52.334
<v Speaker 3>talk to and thinking they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>download their consciousness and </v>

1884
01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.290
<v Speaker 3>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1885
01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.124
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of guys who had these </v>
<v Speaker 3>screens over their phones because they </v>

1886
01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 3>were convinced that the artificial light</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's emanating from phones is damaging</v>

1887
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:04.184
<v Speaker 3>your brain and damaging sleep patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>and giving you an artificial light </v>

1888
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially right before you go to bed.</v>

1889
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Could potentially disrupt your sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1891
01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole theory behind all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

1892
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife was wearing these wacky glasses </v>

1893
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 3>for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1894
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:19.134
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you remember the Baas Brian </v>

1895
01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Bosworth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember those fucking goes,</v>

1896
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:23.663
<v Speaker 3>those blades that would cover your whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>face is this shoot led light and you're </v>

1897
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:27.953
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1898
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.990
<v Speaker 3>like it's like a orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1899
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:32.430
<v Speaker 3>and that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that was,</v>

1900
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.060
<v Speaker 3>it would filter light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the blockers,</v>

1901
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.150
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way.</v>

1902
01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was designed specifically to calm</v>

1903
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:42.330
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1904
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.100
<v Speaker 3>the interaction of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyeballs with like,</v>

1905
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1906
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.053
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at a photo of Brian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bosworth who was a famous football guy </v>

1907
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:54.594
<v Speaker 3>from the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess with these ridiculous glasses </v>

1908
01:20:57.541 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 3>that no one wants anyone to hearing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1909
01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.393
<v Speaker 3>Let's terminator glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were the things right after the </v>

1910
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 3>terminator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these,</v>

1911
01:21:05.011 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goggles,</v>

1912
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:07.584
<v Speaker 3>these things that people wear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wear them and they think that </v>

1913
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another like filtering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>light will enhance your sleep and,</v>

1914
01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.110
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there science behind all that?</v>

1915
01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Like the flux thing or is she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1916
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.190
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look into the science.</v>

1917
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if apple's adding it,</v>

1918
01:21:22.321 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 3>there must be something they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>just do that for funsies.</v>

1919
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume data behind it.</v>

1920
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you use all apple products?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>

1921
01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:31.764
<v Speaker 3>I have an android phone as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to kind of mess around with stuff </v>

1922
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 3>to stay current.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1923
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:36.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all apple.</v>

1924
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an android phone to,</v>

1925
01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.513
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the galaxy phones or they're </v>

1926
01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:43.620
<v Speaker 3>probably pretty commensurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1927
01:21:43.621 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1928
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.690
<v Speaker 3>when I go back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1929
01:21:45.691 --> 01:21:46.524
<v Speaker 3>one of them is to get used to it and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way it communicates with laptops and </v>

1930
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:53.040
<v Speaker 3>other apple people and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>airdrop stuff.</v>

1931
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 3>There's like some definitely benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1932
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:57.420
<v Speaker 3>But there's also some benefits of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>android platform to,</v>

1933
01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:58.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the,</v>

1934
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the new Amazon prime stuff.</v>

1935
01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Like they're the new TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1936
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got all the streaming.</v>

1937
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better Ui,</v>

1938
01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 3>I think the new apple stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1939
01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:10.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish that it would catch up and become</v>

1940
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 3>like a real competitor to Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1941
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:13.643
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of closing in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating their own content now and </v>

1942
01:22:15.361 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 3>they're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to,</v>

1943
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:17.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really become like there are some </v>

1944
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 3>options to where you can download the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1945
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 3>the movies to your device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you can't really do with Netflix.</v>

1946
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 3>So if you're on a plane or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1947
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:27.924
<v Speaker 3>flying over the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of fucked if you want to </v>

1948
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:30.960
<v Speaker 3>watch netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1949
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.850
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also some stuff that I think,</v>

1950
01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:37.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1951
01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:38.843
<v Speaker 3>you can definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can definitely make the argument </v>

1952
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.083
<v Speaker 3>that it's probably a good idea to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support emerging pot or other platforms </v>

1953
01:22:45.511 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1954
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:50.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good thing for everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be on apple.</v>

1955
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.971
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1956
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:51.804
<v Speaker 3>I think the more android's come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sophisticated devices and more </v>

1957
01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:58.140
<v Speaker 3>interesting options and features and </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications more,</v>

1958
01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:00.150
<v Speaker 3>it's going to force apple to raise their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar as well.</v>

1959
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1960
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 3>And I think that a lot of the Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like the echo,</v>

1961
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 3>like those devices in your home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can speak to those</v>

1962
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are a lot of fun.</v>

1963
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually finding it pretty useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you use it for you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing there in the kitchen?</v>

1965
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:12.604
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran out of trash bags and you just </v>

1966
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1967
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>order me new trash bags and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks into your previous purchases.</v>

1968
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It knows that you've bought those bags </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1969
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 1>It knows your home address and as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card.</v>

1970
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And I just thought I'd make this ends it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1971
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And do you have to press a button to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santo,</v>

1972
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but just say it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1973
01:23:27.191 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you just query the device and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order me trash bags.</v>

1974
01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:31.744
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to talk to the device and </v>

1975
01:23:32.561 --> 01:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Alexa.</v>

1976
01:23:33.491 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's like people get mad when I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>hey theory on the podcast,</v>

1977
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>because then their phone starts going </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1978
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Turn that shit off folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1980
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.340
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a podcast in your own voices.</v>

1981
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not ready yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not the vest.</v>

1982
01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.050
<v Speaker 1>She's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a Google version of Siri?</v>

1983
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:50.351
<v Speaker 1>There?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1984
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:51.184
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A okay.</v>

1986

<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1988

1989
01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it just,</v>

1990
01:23:58.570 --> 01:23:59.403
<v Speaker 1>the Google one's actually quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been wanting to fuck around with a </v>

1991
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 1>windows laptop for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't bring myself to do it.</v>

1992
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And they got the new tablet and I use it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for about a week and I send it back.</v>

1993
01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's funny is you get it and you're so</v>

1994
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:12.460
<v Speaker 1>excited and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1995
01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:13.294
<v Speaker 1>it looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know they've sold me because </v>

1996
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 1>they come up with these like fun little </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and stuff and,</v>

1997
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you realize you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1998
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm in windows in your backend.</v>

1999
01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll reappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll go,</v>

2000
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.500
<v Speaker 1>it'll look like this beautiful interface</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

2001
01:24:26.501 --> 01:24:27.334
<v Speaker 1>oh cool apps and all this and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go into settings and it's </v>

2002
01:24:29.471 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a 10,000</v>

2003
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:31.804
<v Speaker 1>options and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it defaults back to that old windows </v>

2004
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:36.310
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they fixed that with the</v>

2005
01:24:36.311 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 1>latest version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that was my problem with it.</v>

2006
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:39.334
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized this is just windows again </v>

2007
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this a tablet?</v>

2008
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you still go into dos?</v>

2009
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he can still go and still in </v>

2010
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.850
<v Speaker 1>command prompts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Which I kind of liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brings back the old school.</v>

2012
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some new laptops.</v>

2013
01:24:56.830 --> 01:25:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Like Lenovo has some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new thinkpads.</v>

2014
01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:03.370
<v Speaker 1>They are pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really good keyboards.</v>

2015
01:25:03.371 --> 01:25:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And what about the chromebook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you played around with that?</v>

2016
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>

2017
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.760
<v Speaker 1>those are pretty cool.</v>

2018
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who worked for Google and</v>

2019
01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 1>she had one of those and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2020
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:12.010
<v Speaker 1>where do you store things on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

2021
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.450
<v Speaker 1>it's all in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2022
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:16.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't the fuck out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>

2023
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything on your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

2024
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.533
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of like that now with the </v>

2025
01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:20.890
<v Speaker 1>apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2027
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Because then you can smash it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can lose it,</v>

2028
01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

2029
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.670
<v Speaker 1>You just get a new one and you're back </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and running in like 10 minutes.</v>

2030
01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you have any of your writing that</v>

2031
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't want people to access that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>up there in the cloud?</v>

2032
01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:34.480
<v Speaker 1>You just use two factor auth and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff?</v>

2033
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:35.343
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it has to send you a text </v>

2034
01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:40.270
<v Speaker 1>with a code in order for you to log in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a new device so that way,</v>

2035
01:25:40.271 --> 01:25:42.460
<v Speaker 1>even if they know your password,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get into your stuff.</v>

2036
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:44.140
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2037
01:25:44.141 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 1>So I have that turned on for everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then yeah,</v>

2038
01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:47.530
<v Speaker 1>everything's in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All photos,</v>

2039
01:25:47.531 --> 01:25:49.540
<v Speaker 1>all videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all documents,</v>

2040
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.290
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a man with no porn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You feel real confident.</v>

2044
01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:55.661
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2045
01:25:55.661 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 1>it's in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and look at pictures of my dog.</v>

2046
01:25:57.911 --> 01:26:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2047
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.233
<v Speaker 1>there was a sticker I want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like the cloud is really just </v>

2048
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.980
<v Speaker 1>someone else's computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very true.</v>

2049
01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It is it just someone else's computer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No clouds up in the sky.</v>

2050
01:26:09.481 --> 01:26:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You fucks like why are you calling it </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cloud when it's on the ground?</v>

2051
01:26:12.261 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just someone's computer.</v>

2052
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

2053
01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Why say the cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why you would say the</v>

2054
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 1>crises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyberspace.</v>

2055
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:21.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we don't really use cyberspace </v>

2056
01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:22.904
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2057
01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>That really wasn't that brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the cloud is,</v>

2058
01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would be a good replacement for</v>

2059
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 1>what the clipboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cloud,</v>

2060
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I kinda like it.</v>

2062
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me think of this like,</v>

2063
01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the cloud easy,</v>

2064
01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>it's redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can never lose.</v>

2065
01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Your data is distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So clouds are everywhere.</v>

2066
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as your data,</v>

2067
01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.760
<v Speaker 1>which is concerning slash awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2068
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she,</v>

2069
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I just am always in this position where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2070
01:26:56.691 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

2071
01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get online and I want to have </v>

2072
01:27:01.851 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 1>access to my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is low,</v>

2073
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 1>locally cached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2074
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2075
01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 1>icloud on your desktop or dropbox or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>

2076
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.670
<v Speaker 1>even if you're an airplane mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still gonna be there.</v>

2077
01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:13.670
<v Speaker 1>You just double click to open it.</v>

2078
01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 1>You're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It syncs the changes later.</v>

2079
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2080
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:19.700
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing it for is really just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fancy backup.</v>

2081
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case he ever lose the device,</v>

2082
01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 1>everything's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fancy backup is a great idea.</v>

2083
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 1>But what would it actually disturbs me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that we're going to get to a</v>

2084
01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:28.694
<v Speaker 1>point where you don't have any hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive space and so you're not storing </v>

2085
01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:32.294
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just accessing things that are </v>

2086
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and you're paying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that service.</v>

2087
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:36.123
<v Speaker 1>I pay apple probably $150 a year for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud storage and it backs up all of my </v>

2088
01:27:40.161 --> 01:27:43.030
<v Speaker 1>devices to have cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do the apple music thing when you</v>

2089
01:27:43.031 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 1>pay the eight bucks a month?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did play with it.</v>

2090
01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought the interface kind of socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Itunes is so bloated right now.</v>

2091
01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:54.260
<v Speaker 1>What is cool though is Siri could call </v>
<v Speaker 1>up songs and you just have on your phone</v>

2092
01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:55.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Siri,</v>

2093
01:27:55.461 --> 01:28:00.140
<v Speaker 1>play Michael Jackson and it'll say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>song and then you say thriller bitch.</v>

2094
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Amazon does that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The echo does that.</v>

2095
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:03.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:07.040
<v Speaker 1>You can just tell it to play anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have Amazon prime,</v>

2097
01:28:07.041 --> 01:28:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you get access to all their free prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and then it just plays it.</v>

2098
01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 1>They're all doing it now and spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's doing it.</v>

2099
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I want to fuck around with </v>

2100
01:28:14.691 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 1>other platforms just because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>been such an apple dork.</v>

2101
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:19.003
<v Speaker 1>But then part of me goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just cause you're a </v>

2102
01:28:19.731 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 1>procrastinator and you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2103
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to start playing with some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm but I'll get to work.</v>

2104
01:28:24.351 --> 01:28:25.184
<v Speaker 1>Once I figured out how to run this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>lamp option and figured out how to </v>

2105
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>format my hard drive now how do I de </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frag on this windows device,</v>

2106
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.950
<v Speaker 1>what we all do it and then you always </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to apple.</v>

2107
01:28:33.951 --> 01:28:34.784
<v Speaker 1>At least that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in my experience cause you're </v>

2108
01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:36.650
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2109
01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>there's some little things that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do right the way you're used to.</v>

2110
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd go back to also apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps getting better.</v>

2111
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.363
<v Speaker 1>The devices keep getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just get it better and better and </v>

2112
01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like this one then I have,</v>

2113
01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:50.810
<v Speaker 1>here is no his flash drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm fucking addicted to.</v>

2114
01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So it powers on like that accesses data </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2115
01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so addicted to that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the spinning spinning of the </v>

2116
01:28:58.401 --> 01:28:59.390
<v Speaker 1>hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2117
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you dropped it the hard drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

2118
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2119
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>These things are bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

2120
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:04.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that one?</v>

2121
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 3>That one's not retina display.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

2122
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2123
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2124

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's a Mac book pro.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Pretty Slick.</v>

2129

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 3>On a reading.</v>

2131
01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.530
<v Speaker 3>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter at that point.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Barely can read text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Katy Bowman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Katy Katy Bowman,</v>

2144
01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:53.274
<v Speaker 3>Katy Bowman who was on the podcast is </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of an expert and physical movement </v>

2145
01:29:57.691 --> 01:29:58.524
<v Speaker 3>and she's got a lot of interesting ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>about biology and one of her thoughts </v>

2146
01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about glasses and about,</v>

2147
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:05.694
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you spend a lot of time looking at </v>

2148
01:30:07.621 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a screen,</v>

2149
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.313
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at something that's a </v>

2150
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:11.724
<v Speaker 3>very fixed distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is unusual and the is not really </v>

2151
01:30:14.071 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 3>designed to focus constantly on a fixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance for eight hours a day.</v>

2152
01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Your body's supposed to look at things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are over there,</v>

2153
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:22.200
<v Speaker 3>things that are up here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are everywhere.</v>

2154
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.213
<v Speaker 3>And in that way your body gets this </v>
<v Speaker 3>broad range of things that you're </v>

2155
01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:29.310
<v Speaker 3>viewing all of these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>distances.</v>

2156
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:32.250
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at something that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fixed distance,</v>

2157
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:36.630
<v Speaker 3>she likens it to being in a cast like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and a cast your,</v>

2158
01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.920
<v Speaker 3>your muscles atrophy.</v>

2159
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:38.783
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that technology slowly killing </v>

2160
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:41.760
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it and hate it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is people say back in</v>

2176
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:20.394
<v Speaker 3>the day people didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a photograph of the subway </v>

2177
01:31:23.641 --> 01:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>from like 1960 or something like that.</v>

2178
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 3>The reading papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>

2179
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 3>every fucking person is in their reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>a newspaper.</v>

2180
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I think Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it was one tab,</v>

2181
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

2182
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like one page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these people.</v>

2183
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like they're not,</v>

2184
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:43.350
<v Speaker 3>there's no tab browsing there but not </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping around reading the paper.</v>

2185
01:31:43.351 --> 01:31:44.550
<v Speaker 3>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2186
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.940
<v Speaker 3>They're not looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>

2187
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.330
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that we used to be amazing and</v>

2188
01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 3>we used to be gregarious and want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn off tad browsing.</v>

2189
01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2190
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that's what's killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tabbed browsing on your phone just on,</v>

2191
01:31:57.841 --> 01:31:58.674
<v Speaker 3>on your desktop computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always say while leave that tab </v>

2192
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:02.134
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm definitely gonna need to get </v>

2193
01:32:02.591 --> 01:32:04.060
<v Speaker 3>the APP tabs that have been open for </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

2194
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.193
<v Speaker 3>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever gone back to your email </v>

2195
01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:11.030
<v Speaker 3>tab and like there's an email that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to hit send all yeah,</v>

2196
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:16.070
<v Speaker 3>like eight hours ago you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck yeah.</v>

2197
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:17.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you know it's definitely not </v>

2198
01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:20.890
<v Speaker 3>perfect but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2199
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2200
01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm also a fan of self discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you need,</v>

2201
01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 3>you need your own sort of boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you won't cross.</v>

2202
01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2203
01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x amount of time per day,</v>

2204
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or six o'clock at night,</v>

2205
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I put everything away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're done.</v>

2206
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you need to get ahold of me,</v>

2207
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:42.070
<v Speaker 3>call me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2208
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.220
<v Speaker 3>nobody fucking calls me on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't even have a home phone.</v>

2209
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never answered that God damn thing.</v>

2210
01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody calls me exactly,</v>

2211
01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't I have it?</v>

2212
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I was a little bit one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was a fire on the right.</v>

2213
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.380
<v Speaker 3>You just need to get ahold of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2214
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2215
01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.250
<v Speaker 3>but there's levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone,</v>

2216
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.263
<v Speaker 3>like I'll check my phone in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll see text messages and I'll see </v>

2217
01:33:03.551 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 3>if anything's important.</v>

2218
01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:06.360
<v Speaker 3>If someone I care about sends me a text </v>
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>

2219
01:33:06.361 --> 01:33:08.860
<v Speaker 3>then something might be important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's level one.</v>

2220
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Level two is I'll check my email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like next level.</v>

2221
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Then level three is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started going into social media,</v>

2222
01:33:14.981 --> 01:33:16.190
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>

2223
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.810
<v Speaker 3>facebook and twitter and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2224
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 3>and then there's level four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started googling shit and checking out</v>

2225
01:33:23.141 --> 01:33:25.220
<v Speaker 3>forums and reading information about </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2226
01:33:25.221 --> 01:33:27.090
<v Speaker 3>But that's then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going deeper and deeper into</v>

2227
01:33:27.091 --> 01:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're looking to be distracted,</v>

2228
01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to dig,</v>

2229
01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like get that for real man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>been for years.</v>

2231
01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 3>My main sources of wacky shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

2232
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It's still got a lot of wacky shit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2233
01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.430
<v Speaker 3>You are you involved in it at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore?</v>

2234
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:43.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean technically I'm kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>advisor to the company and now that I'm </v>

2235
01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:46.360
<v Speaker 3>out in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2236
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:47.350
<v Speaker 3>they're based out there.</v>

2237
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 3>So I spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the team from time to time.</v>

2238
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was just,</v>

2239
01:33:51.341 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so many years of blood,</v>

2240
01:33:54.251 --> 01:33:55.990
<v Speaker 3>sweat and tears that I kind of got burnt</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2241
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't look at any more cat videos,</v>

2242
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:59.183
<v Speaker 3>check out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a great resource for someone </v>

2243
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.350
<v Speaker 3>who's just curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what's interesting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ha ha ha.</v>

2245

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2246

<v Speaker 3>I'll look at it every day and I'll find </v>

2247

<v Speaker 3>at least one thing everyday that a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>to read like holy shit and I have to </v>

2248
01:34:15.491 --> 01:34:16.324
<v Speaker 3>click on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's interesting because I'll send </v>

2249
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:20.224
<v Speaker 3>someone a dig link and there's a desire </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have a completely unfounded </v>

2250
01:34:24.641 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 3>desire to be over something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>space or I want to get an AOL.</v>

2255
01:34:37.811 --> 01:34:38.644

<v Speaker 3>their emails so bad ass that no one </v>

2262
01:34:58.090 --> 01:35:00.860

<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

2290
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Like there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

2291
01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:07.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>application that you can switch back and</v>

2292
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:09.300
<v Speaker 1>forth between windows and Mac?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:12.020
<v Speaker 1>They had like the boot camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called it where you could boot into</v>

2294
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still around.</v>

2295
01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that it's,</v>

2296
01:36:14.621 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it's all a intel hardware so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>boot into windows if you want to,</v>

2297
01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's still like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the graphics cards are a few generations</v>

2298
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird,</v>

2299
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like apple doesn't care.</v>

2300
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:28.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't have really anyone doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>super high end gaming on their rigs,</v>

2301
01:36:28.121 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 1>so they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not their,</v>

2302
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:30.493
<v Speaker 1>their game anymore.</v>

2303
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Well you remember when Steve Jobs came </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and they killed the clones?</v>

2304
01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it was kind of weird because</v>

2305
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 1>before then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could buy a Mac online.</v>

2306
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:41.840
<v Speaker 1>That was way more powerful than anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2307
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Apple was selling way more hard drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2308
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Sli video cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do an sli video.</v>

2309
01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:48.723
<v Speaker 1>He's already done us a lie now that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was before then they had souped up </v>

2310
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2311
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 1>processors though and like much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

2312
01:36:56.391 --> 01:36:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Much more storage space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2313
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

2314
01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2315
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

2316
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you still can't run Mac os on a PC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2317
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:07.620
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to have this,</v>

2318
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:10.370
<v Speaker 1>it's own rom like a special apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2319
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 1>But I know people who've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hacks around it,</v>

2320
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but it never works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

2321
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Percent,</v>

2322
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:15.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to go crazy anytime </v>

2323
01:37:16.401 --> 01:37:17.234
<v Speaker 1>there's like a software update,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just like patch it so you're not </v>

2324
01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:19.550
<v Speaker 1>always running the latest.</v>

2325
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always a war like that.</v>

2326
01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.301
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2327
01:37:24.301 --> 01:37:25.870
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2328
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:26.713
<v Speaker 1>really interesting the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dual platform thing because it kind </v>

2329
01:37:29.031 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 1>of becomes a tribe thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2330
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.680
<v Speaker 1>like people get addicted to rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one particular sprites team.</v>

2331
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:37.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've been with the cubs since the </v>

2332
01:37:38.131 --> 01:37:39.950
<v Speaker 1>beginning getting on know we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs to the end.</v>

2333
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2334
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 1>go cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get that way with windows.</v>

2335
01:37:43.131 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 1>They can take it the way the websites </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

2336
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying with my space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those others,</v>

2337
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the same thing with dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were like pissed off at dig for a</v>

2338
01:37:48.791 --> 01:37:50.240
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed.</v>

2339
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:54.410
<v Speaker 1>And when it changes its look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got all these people are fucked,</v>

2341
01:37:54.411 --> 01:37:55.220
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

2342
01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when you're just looking to say </v>

2343
01:37:56.521 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're looking to do.</v>

2344
01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like you look in to be over </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2345
01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this is not a rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreement or a grievance you have.</v>

2346
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of,</v>

2347
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2348
01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

2349
01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:10.870
<v Speaker 1>one thing we learned is that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2350
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 1>they love when they get into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really into it,</v>

2351
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>they're hesitant to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anything that you change,</v>

2352
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you move an icon or change a color or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff.</v>

2353
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.543
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of the reason probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>why read it hasn't made a whole lot of </v>

2354
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 1>big over arching changes to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

2355
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:26.814
<v Speaker 1>It kind of feels the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks the same functions the same is </v>

2356
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:31.520
<v Speaker 1>because people fell in love with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2357
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.453
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make any changes there and you have </v>

2358
01:38:33.721 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>a revolt on your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2359
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.473
<v Speaker 1>So for us it was difficult because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had taken a lot of investor funding and </v>

2360
01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:42.930
<v Speaker 1>they wanted us to go very mainstream.</v>

2361
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>

2362
01:38:44.101 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 1>there was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2363
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 1>how can we get your mom reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig or whatever it may be.</v>

2364
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:50.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2365
01:38:50.311 --> 01:38:51.660
<v Speaker 1>in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the,</v>

2366
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>that was the wrong approach apps because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

2367
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.073
<v Speaker 1>we should have been a loyal to our core </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and kind of been all about </v>

2368
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the site is today.</v>

2369
01:39:00.691 --> 01:39:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more like it was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2370
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 1>granted the design has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2371
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the content is more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the mistake that we made is we tried</v>

2372
01:39:09.761 --> 01:39:10.594
<v Speaker 1>to push into more kind of mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>news when really what date may dig so </v>

2373
01:39:14.671 --> 01:39:17.490
<v Speaker 1>special is that was able to unearth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the really kind of unique,</v>

2374
01:39:17.491 --> 01:39:20.310
<v Speaker 1>obscure random stuff from around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>web.</v>

2375
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a,</v>

2376
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 1>but it was a crazy ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were,</v>

2377
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably seven or so years that,</v>

2378
01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:31.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of riding that wave,</v>

2379
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like all Internet properties,</v>

2380
01:39:33.391 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you can last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2381
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 1>If you can last seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievable.</v>

2382
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you can last 10 that's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost unheard of.</v>

2383
01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I go to it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me nothing's changed.</v>

2384
01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that popularity,</v>

2385
01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.470
<v Speaker 1>there's hasn't dropped off at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met,</v>

2386
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I met with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2387
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:47.683
<v Speaker 1>the John Borthwick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heads up Beta works and he was saying </v>

2388
01:39:49.201 --> 01:39:54.201
<v Speaker 1>it's something like a total of 42 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million across all platform a month.</v>

2389
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:56.063
<v Speaker 1>Dig still receives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's across mobile and desktop and </v>

2390
01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:02.940
<v Speaker 1>everything else that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still a man,</v>

2391
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:04.890
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of fucking people,</v>

2392
01:40:04.891 --> 01:40:06.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

2393
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.253
<v Speaker 1>It's just an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when someone can just collect </v>

2394
01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 1>things for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some aggregates.</v>

2395
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 1>All those interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

2396
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 1>bizarre shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a one stop shop.</v>

2397
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of always going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>market for that.</v>

2398
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing now with my newsletter.</v>

2399
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw that.</v>

2400
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I launched a new newsletter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2401
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:23.063
<v Speaker 1>launch a newsletter here just a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and I only put it out once a </v>

2402

<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

2403
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2404
01:40:28.501 --> 01:40:31.800
<v Speaker 1>when I was in television on techtv and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the other stuff that we did,</v>

2405
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.680
<v Speaker 1>it was always about producing new </v>
<v Speaker 1>content every single day.</v>

2406
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And you can never really put the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff out there.</v>

2407
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 1>You're always in a rush to produce your </v>
<v Speaker 1>segment.</v>

2408
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:39.691
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2409
01:40:39.691 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>

2410
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:41.300
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2411
01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.133
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I create a newsletter that is </v>

2412
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:45.230
<v Speaker 1>basically just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2413
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 1>my favorite stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

2414
01:40:49.110 --> 01:40:49.943
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things that are fully vetted that </v>

2415
01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>has spent a lot of time collecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

2416
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I released it once a month on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of every month.</v>

2417
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

2418
01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 1>The fully vetted things great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because God,</v>

2419
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:01.090
<v Speaker 1>there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

2420
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:02.043
<v Speaker 1>how many stories do you get that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely contradicting something that </v>

2421
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:06.880
<v Speaker 1>was a story just a week ago.</v>

2422
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2423
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:08.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is right?</v>

2424
01:41:08.801 --> 01:41:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Well now you've got to make me do </v>
<v Speaker 1>research right now.</v>

2425
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I got to snopes this and figure this out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to figure out who's team Amman </v>

2426
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and which articles seems most rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if then,</v>

2427
01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:18.064
<v Speaker 1>if you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to go into scientific </v>

2428
01:41:19.151 --> 01:41:19.984
<v Speaker 1>papers and I'll fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to contact people and </v>

2429
01:41:22.091 --> 01:41:22.924
<v Speaker 1>search forums and see what the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are actually studying this shit </v>

2430
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's nice if someone vents it out in</v>

2431
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:29.740
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:31.180
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I put a product on there,</v>

2433
01:41:31.181 --> 01:41:34.270
<v Speaker 1>it has to be something that like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology product that I've used for at</v>

2434
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.860
<v Speaker 1>least a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you,</v>

2435
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that kind of like I get</v>

2436
01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:38.344
<v Speaker 1>hyped up on something for a few days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually ends up sucking and you've </v>

2437
01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:42.010
<v Speaker 1>already plugged it in your life to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>me an example of that.</v>

2438
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it just like any new </v>

2439
01:41:43.721 --> 01:41:45.040
<v Speaker 1>product that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2440
01:41:45.041 --> 01:41:47.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the echo first came out,</v>

2441
01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.740
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon Echo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I,</v>

2442
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it got better with a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>software updates.</v>

2443
01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:56.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad I didn't plug it initially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I kinda thought it sucked but it,</v>

2444
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot better now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it took some time to get there.</v>

2445
01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make sure that if I'm,</v>

2446
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.613
<v Speaker 1>I feel like our time is really precious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our time is really precious and </v>

2447
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 1>if you push someone to go read something</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to buy something,</v>

2448
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.260
<v Speaker 1>it should be worth their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2449
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 1>and so I want to put a lot of effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that,</v>

2450
01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:14.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2451
01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way to approach it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2452
01:42:16.091 --> 01:42:16.924
<v Speaker 1>And if someone's going to really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to paying attention to you on </v>

2453
01:42:19.721 --> 01:42:21.850
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a monthly basis,</v>

2454
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the best way to do it.</v>

2455
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:23.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2456
01:42:23.931 --> 01:42:25.870
<v Speaker 1>That you're filtering it out before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to them.</v>

2457
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:27.071
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2459
01:42:27.071 --> 01:42:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it's called the journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can set up@thejournal.email.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.500

<v Speaker 1>address to send one a month and um,</v>

2464
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:39.683
<v Speaker 1>and you can use it for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use a domain for it or whatever </v>

2465
01:42:40.991 --> 01:42:42.430

<v Speaker 1>Email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain extension.</v>

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:08.050
<v Speaker 1>what is something that's really got you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyped up?</v>

2482
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arrow wifi system.</v>

2483
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.650
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

2484
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.483
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

2485
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:13.480
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2486
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:14.343
<v Speaker 1>So you know how there's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had wifi units that it's like one </v>

2487
01:43:18.281 --> 01:43:19.114
<v Speaker 1>base station to rule them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have one base station and they </v>

2488
01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:23.890
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get crazier every year.</v>

2489
01:43:23.891 --> 01:43:24.724
<v Speaker 1>They have get more antennas on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this idea of one master base </v>

2490
01:43:28.121 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blankets here entire house.</v>

2491
01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.033
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great if you have a small </v>

2492
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:33.454
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a house or two bedroom or </v>

2493
01:43:34.571 --> 01:43:35.404
<v Speaker 1>three bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's next to impossible to get like </v>

2494
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:40.360
<v Speaker 1>streaming video down at bedroom number </v>
<v Speaker 1>three down the hall.</v>

2495
01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So arrows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2496
01:43:41.861 --> 01:43:42.694
<v Speaker 1>screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to make one master </v>

2497
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:44.674
<v Speaker 1>massive base station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make these little tiny </v>

2498
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.433
<v Speaker 1>like hockey puck style little stations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get three of them in a pack and </v>

2499
01:43:51.381 --> 01:43:52.214
<v Speaker 1>then you just plugged them in and around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and they work off a mesh </v>

2500
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:56.900
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

2501
01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:59.210
<v Speaker 1>So they all mesh with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not extenders.</v>

2502
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 1>They're like using their own dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>little wireless signals to do Mesh.</v>

2503
01:44:02.271 --> 01:44:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Almost like the way a Sonos would </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in your house.</v>

2504
01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:05.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just have universal </v>

2505
01:44:06.921 --> 01:44:07.754
<v Speaker 1>blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high speed coverage and so it doesn't </v>

2506
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 1>vary no matter where you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2507
01:44:11.841 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 1>In New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having issues like trying cause my</v>

2508
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Wifi or my um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable modem was all the way on the other</v>

2509
01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>end of the house and I have a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway kind of going between the dining</v>

2510
01:44:21.411 --> 01:44:23.830
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front room and um,</v>

2511
01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I plucked three of men all going down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hallway.</v>

2512
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And normally with these boosters or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>

2513
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of suck.</v>

2514
01:44:30.051 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't ever work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2515
01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one just,</v>

2516
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean set up on your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you spell it?</v>

2517
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.920
<v Speaker 1>E R O.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com.</v>

2518
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are right there.</v>

2519
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:40.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a three units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2520
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the screen there.</v>

2521
01:44:41.181 --> 01:44:42.070
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2522
01:44:42.071 --> 01:44:45.080
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty amazing and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new technology.</v>

2523
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:47.120
<v Speaker 1>One of their investors was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2524
01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:48.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought them on Amazon and this is </v>

2525
01:44:50.151 --> 01:44:50.984
<v Speaker 1>something that I just mentioned to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>newsletter because I had some time to </v>

2526
01:44:52.431 --> 01:44:53.640
<v Speaker 1>spend with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2527
01:44:53.641 --> 01:44:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and that actually really I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have wife,</v>

2528
01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 1>if your wife works great at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mess with it.</v>

2529
01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're having issues,</v>

2530
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this works,</v>

2531
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:02.023
<v Speaker 1>why does it have a phone there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an APP that we're set up is </v>

2532
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:05.384
<v Speaker 1>just what the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even make you use a desktop </v>

2533
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:10.480
<v Speaker 1>to set it up at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just plug it into your,</v>

2534
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:12.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

2535
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:15.380
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cable that connects into your router.</v>

2536
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:16.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just plug it right in your router </v>

2537
01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:18.800
<v Speaker 1>with the first base station and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and take the other ones.</v>

2538
01:45:18.801 --> 01:45:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just them around your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2539
01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does it work with uh,</v>

2540
01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:26.630
<v Speaker 1>the Apple Wifi system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got rid of the apple.</v>

2541
01:45:26.631 --> 01:45:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I unplugged it all together and just use</v>
<v Speaker 1>only that and that's only use this.</v>

2542
01:45:29.271 --> 01:45:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2543
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it better,</v>

2544
01:45:33.951 --> 01:45:34.701
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2545
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:37.170
<v Speaker 1>it's been getting great reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2546
01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2547
01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your Wifi is working fine,</v>

2548
01:45:40.521 --> 01:45:41.730
<v Speaker 1>don't mess with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

2549
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2550
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:44.144
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must've like pissed off some kind of </v>

2551
01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2552
01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:48.020
<v Speaker 1>in a previous life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had good wifi.</v>

2553
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Some issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody does.</v>

2554
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.033
<v Speaker 1>The wifi is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're two hours a wondered what's going </v>

2555
01:45:53.841 --> 01:45:54.674
<v Speaker 1>on with those signals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking flying around your house </v>

2556
01:45:56.271 --> 01:45:57.060
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2557
01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that good?</v>

2558
01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're fine too,</v>

2559
01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:01.574
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that same thing you were </v>

2560
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:03.554
<v Speaker 1>saying about there could possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses that we don't necessarily have </v>

2561
01:46:06.531 --> 01:46:07.364
<v Speaker 1>like that we could measure and weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a feeling that you get when </v>

2562
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:11.324
<v Speaker 1>you're like at the top of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go hiking and there's no wifi </v>

2563
01:46:13.161 --> 01:46:14.750
<v Speaker 1>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just feels cleaner.</v>

2564
01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.520
<v Speaker 1>But it also could be the amazing fresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>air could be,</v>

2565
01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:18.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe we can do some dmt at home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start reading people's email.</v>

2567
01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.353
<v Speaker 1>Let's just like by intersecting nursing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's gonna come a point </v>

2568
01:46:25.431 --> 01:46:29.210
<v Speaker 1>in time where there is no longer any </v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy,</v>

2569
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 1>any privacy at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2570
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:34.300
<v Speaker 1>I think privacy is a hot topic right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are,</v>

2571
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>are really starting to get into it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>

2572
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2573
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So they definitely were concerned when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about the NSA thing,</v>

2574
01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>the Edward Snowden thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find out that it's really pretty</v>

2575
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.620
<v Speaker 1>easy to access your information and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2576
01:46:48.621 --> 01:46:50.930
<v Speaker 1>people worry about being hacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2577
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Being fished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:55.350
<v Speaker 1>someone sends you an email and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were worried about privacy.</v>

2579
01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:56.184
<v Speaker 1>But my concern is that it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what what's going on with technology in </v>

2580
01:46:59.941 --> 01:47:02.610
<v Speaker 1>general is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to the Internet</v>

2581
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and anything information based is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to information is getting quicker</v>

2582
01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:07.614
<v Speaker 1>and quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2583
01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.453
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have more access to more </v>
<v Speaker 1>data and more access to each other and </v>

2584
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.133
<v Speaker 1>each other's data and eventually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that keeps going and keeps going </v>

2585
01:47:16.351 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna come a point in time where</v>

2586
01:47:18.571 --> 01:47:20.250
<v Speaker 1>we're just fucking reading each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

2587
01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

2588
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's really not going to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy if at all.</v>

2589
01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is,</v>

2590
01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.193
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly people trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>the envelope there and there has been </v>

2591
01:47:31.501 --> 01:47:34.200
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years and in startups </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've seen like a,</v>

2592
01:47:34.201 --> 01:47:37.030
<v Speaker 1>there was a startup that at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2593
01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:37.883
<v Speaker 1>you would often all of your credit cards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would share out socially the </v>

2594
01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:41.694
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you were buying with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically if you went on there </v>

2595
01:47:45.241 --> 01:47:46.920
<v Speaker 1>and bought a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blood,</v>

2596
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 1>a sensor on Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see that.</v>

2597
01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:50.453
<v Speaker 1>And then I could then use that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover more or less an endorsement from </v>

2598
01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you and go buy something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It blew up and it went out of business,</v>

2599
01:47:56.850 --> 01:47:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but they were kind of pushing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there has to be a trade off,</v>

2600
01:47:59.011 --> 01:48:00.930
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to free </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

2601
01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't expect to be a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>person if you're getting something for </v>

2602
01:48:04.321 --> 01:48:05.540
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2603
01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:09.240
<v Speaker 1>like if you're getting g mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are reading your emails and they're</v>

2604
01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 1>putting ads against it.</v>

2605
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.273
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not a human reading them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their machines are reading them and </v>

2606
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:14.964
<v Speaker 1>placing relevant ads and it's not spooky</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment when you were looking something </v>

2607
01:48:17.881 --> 01:48:20.490
<v Speaker 1>online and then you go and look to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner of your,</v>

2608
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 1>your website page and it's that exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>ad.</v>

2609
01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's fine.</v>

2610
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that because it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go drive down to the </v>

2611
01:48:29.251 --> 01:48:32.280
<v Speaker 1>library and look up a book and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what I was trying,</v>

2612
01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google is providing that service and I'm</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

2614

<v Speaker 1>It's not terrible.</v>

2619
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:50.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's something that you already </v>

2620
01:48:51.241 --> 01:48:53.100
<v Speaker 1>expressed intent towards.</v>

2621

<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that mct oil.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2624
01:48:59.981 --> 01:49:02.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it could be a is it depends on</v>

2625
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:04.470
<v Speaker 1>the targeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they do that though it,</v>

2626
01:49:04.610 --> 01:49:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Google doesn't allow that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2627
01:49:06.271 --> 01:49:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that would be rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2628
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Try explaining that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:13.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a cause for bitten by the terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of service.</v>

2630
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:14.713
<v Speaker 1>Must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's funny because that's where </v>

2631
01:49:15.961 --> 01:49:18.270
<v Speaker 1>people draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like sexual pleasure,</v>

2632
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 1>like sexual pleasure and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies.</v>

2633
01:49:20.641 --> 01:49:22.080
<v Speaker 1>That's where we draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2634
01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:24.810
<v Speaker 1>But what you can talk about openly and </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could have a shoe fetish and </v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.253
<v Speaker 3>I had some friends that went with nt but</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem was you would have issues </v>

2673
01:50:57.461 --> 01:50:58.294
<v Speaker 3>with certain drivers for video cards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be like really hip on the </v>

2674
01:51:01.811 --> 01:51:06.811
<v Speaker 3>forums and make sure you get on a irt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Erc and find out where the uh,</v>

2675
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:12.400
<v Speaker 3>the best drivers are and how to Super </v>
<v Speaker 3>Geeky days.</v>

2676
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like certain resolutions you </v>

<v Speaker 3>that he had to file a format with the </v>

2678
01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:21.630
<v Speaker 3>NTSF file system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that IRC was always weird to so</v>

2679
01:51:21.631 --> 01:51:23.590
<v Speaker 3>strange cause you could send files to </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2680
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:24.873
<v Speaker 3>It's like IRC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a strange message sort of </v>

2681
01:51:28.421 --> 01:51:31.780
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The original hashtags where an IRC,</v>

2682
01:51:31.781 --> 01:51:34.290
<v Speaker 3>do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do like pound a channel?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2684
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.473
<v Speaker 3>This is all from my quake playing days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was how clans would communicate </v>

2685
01:51:40.571 --> 01:51:41.404
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.180
<v Speaker 3>The quake teams would call each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>clans.</v>

2687

<v Speaker 3>First People look,</v>

2689
01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.533

2698
01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:04.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>IRC channels and we'd have like a window</v>

2699
01:52:04.661 --> 01:52:05.494
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of guys would run two </v>

2700
01:52:06.581 --> 01:52:07.414
<v Speaker 3>screens.</v>

2701
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.313
<v Speaker 3>So you'd run a one screen where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>video games playing and then you'd have </v>

2702
01:52:10.901 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 3>another screen next to that separate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was your IRC channel.</v>

2703
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.693
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you'd be communicating with each </v>

2704
01:52:16.721 --> 01:52:19.750
<v Speaker 3>other and you had Iq,</v>

<v Speaker 3>little icq messages while the mass was </v>

<v Speaker 3>Back in the 1990s we used to all meet in</v>

2801
01:56:15.091 --> 01:56:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were a bunch of my friends.</v>

2802
01:56:17.401 --> 01:56:18.234
<v Speaker 3>Where are we going to be seeing over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>link them all together and have zero </v>

2803
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 3>ping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the greatest thing ever.</v>

2804
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:24.023
<v Speaker 3>The most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most brutal thing we would do </v>

2805
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Chad,</v>

2806
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:27.780
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2807
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.470
<v Speaker 3>he had some sort of a tech job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>

2808
01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:32.603
<v Speaker 3>but he had access to his company's board</v>
<v Speaker 3>room and we'd set up everything up in </v>

2809
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:39.000
<v Speaker 3>this board room and these giant tables </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

2810
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And then we would start a server and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then other people would join it,</v>

2811
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:45.210
<v Speaker 3>but they had lag and we didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>lag.</v>

2812
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Just waste them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sweet.</v>

2813
01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.220
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2814
01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 3>shooting chickens and a barrel.</v>

2815
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:53.580
<v Speaker 3>fish in a barrel or whatever it is.</v>

2816
01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:58.500
<v Speaker 3>It's probably also equally easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2817
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.193
<v Speaker 3>after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the worst thing is like you </v>

2819
01:57:02.821 --> 01:57:03.654
<v Speaker 3>would find someone who would kick your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass even though you know they had 50 </v>

2820
01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 3>paying and zero,</v>

<v Speaker 3>people might be watching them play a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking game at the same like,</v>

2860
01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've seen the stadiums in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

2861
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

2862
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.750
<v Speaker 1>The starcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2863
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starcraft,</v>

2864
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

2865
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>See that's not interesting to me though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starcraft is boring to me.</v>

2866
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like chess.</v>

2867
01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's fascinating to Pli.</v>

2868
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I love those games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2869
01:58:59.030 --> 01:59:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that was my bread and butter right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2870
01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:02.530
<v Speaker 1>like command and conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those those.</v>

2871
01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:05.110
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is like chess and it's too much about</v>

2872
01:59:05.111 --> 01:59:05.944
<v Speaker 1>build order now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to really get your </v>

2873
01:59:07.661 --> 01:59:09.940
<v Speaker 1>build order down and just go really fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>up front.</v>

2874
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:11.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the build order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2875
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It just means that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2876
01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you put your power plant first before </v>
<v Speaker 1>your weapons plant,</v>

2877
01:59:15.551 --> 01:59:16.384
<v Speaker 1>before your turret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to know your order </v>

2878
01:59:17.651 --> 01:59:18.484
<v Speaker 1>and once you build things and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust that based on what the they're </v>

2879
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:21.814
<v Speaker 1>bringing against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they're trying to rush you right </v>

2880
01:59:22.721 --> 01:59:23.401
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get tour,</v>

2881
01:59:23.401 --> 01:59:25.590

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2882
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the same as this weekend at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>MLG tournament.</v>

2883
01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:31.900

<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>

2889
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:51.100

<v Speaker 1>to go to one of them as a reporter,</v>

2890
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I would like to interview those guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you've ever been to a wrestlemania.</v>

2894
02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a male soap opera.</v>

2895
02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>You just go there and you drink beer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you yell and then you leave.</v>

2896
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2897
02:00:15.941 --> 02:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>just to experience it one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into it.</v>

2898
02:00:17.861 --> 02:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch it ever.</v>

2899
02:00:19.841 --> 02:00:23.230

<v Speaker 1>but I get it.</v>

2901
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I get how it would be interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think that like,</v>

2902
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm already,</v>

2911
02:00:46.091 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>hoping forever to do an event in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would have to have some crazy,</v>

2912
02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable card to fill that place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2913
02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:56.393
<v Speaker 1>Can you believe that many people go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tickets were 500 to 3000 that's </v>

2914
02:01:00.851 --> 02:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like basically like the super bowl,</v>

2915
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money they must've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that fucking thing's insane.</v>

2916
02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2917
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that they're not athletes.</v>

2918
02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So there's those things are serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

2919
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acrobats.</v>

2921
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that way it's not an unimpressive,</v>

2922
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2923
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2924
02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>thought of the slaves fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do commentary for mma.</v>

2926
02:01:29.321 --> 02:01:30.154
<v Speaker 1>So for me that the reality of MMA is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense and so it's so powerful that </v>

2927
02:01:36.701 --> 02:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2928
02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen much.</v>

2929
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2930
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.340

<v Speaker 3>It's like a phase one guy going down.</v>

2931
02:01:43.341 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

<v Speaker 3>as much as it would be just the </v>

2934
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:51.650
<v Speaker 3>environment in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'd love to do that as well.</v>

2936
02:01:55.130 --> 02:02:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not hanging after the show.</v>

2937
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:02.343
<v Speaker 3>People good to cry all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can make you cry over that fist bump </v>

2938
02:02:05.031 --> 02:02:07.500
<v Speaker 3>and fucking go our separate ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Empty and talk shadow.</v>

2939
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.353
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting a separate cars and even </v>

2940
02:02:09.951 --> 02:02:13.050
<v Speaker 3>like rustling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said fucking cry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2943
02:02:15.801 --> 02:02:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>

2944
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2945
02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:20.810
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough time in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2946
02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:21.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2947
02:02:21.411 --> 02:02:21.960
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2948
02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:24.980
<v Speaker 3>that's why I don't follow baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>

2949
02:02:24.981 --> 02:02:28.700
<v Speaker 3>football or hockey as people try to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shit a game and I go,</v>

2950
02:02:28.710 --> 02:02:29.091
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2951
02:02:29.091 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 3>look at me like I just sucked a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks.</v>

2952
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2953
02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:34.060
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to walk like what you like.</v>

2954
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.521
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2955
02:02:34.521 --> 02:02:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Just because you guys were all in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

2956
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 3>You didn't watch the super bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2957
02:02:38.361 --> 02:02:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want you to superbowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Was that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never watched the superbowl.</v>

2959
02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a good time day to go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get shit done.</v>

2960
02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.150
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at Disneyland.</v>

2961
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.510
<v Speaker 3>We always get emt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People caught on,</v>

2962
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.153
<v Speaker 3>used to be used to be back in the day is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the kids on Disneyland was a </v>

2963
02:02:51.801 --> 02:02:53.190
<v Speaker 3>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2964
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:54.890
<v Speaker 3>some Jewish holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

2965
02:02:55.150 --> 02:02:55.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely wouldn't get like you'd </v>

2966
02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 3>eliminate like 99% of the Jewish people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be a good,</v>

2967
02:03:00.711 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 3>like 30% of the people at the park or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it fuck it would be.</v>

2968
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:07.130
<v Speaker 3>You can catch like days like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're,</v>

2969
02:03:07.131 --> 02:03:10.520
<v Speaker 3>if you want to go to Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a good idea to plan.</v>

2970
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:13.720
<v Speaker 3>You got to look really plot that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2971
02:03:13.721 --> 02:03:14.554
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you try to go on like a </v>

2972
02:03:15.561 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 3>normal day in the summer or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2973
02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:21.590
<v Speaker 3>good fucking luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been easy land forever.</v>

2974
02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:22.453
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it though they have this new star </v>

2975
02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.870
<v Speaker 3>distinguish rod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you what?</v>

2976
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Either Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey legs.</v>

2977
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:30.200
<v Speaker 3>You do Turkey legs there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2978
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:31.131
<v Speaker 3>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2979
02:03:31.131 --> 02:03:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I full Kido now I can,</v>

2980
02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.210
<v Speaker 3>well I did a little cheat and when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Mexico I had some uh,</v>

2981
02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:40.590
<v Speaker 3>tortillas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was still around.</v>

2982
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:41.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did it just because I was on </v>

2983
02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:44.780
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2984
02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to enjoy myself for a few days</v>

2985
02:03:47.091 --> 02:03:50.120
<v Speaker 3>and then get right back onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like the effect of it.</v>

2986
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:51.623
<v Speaker 3>It definitely a noticeable effect on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way I look and noticeable effect in the </v>

2987
02:03:54.411 --> 02:03:55.244
<v Speaker 3>way I feel.</v>

2988
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:56.143
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's some undeniable </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive benefits as far as like the </v>

2989
02:04:00.201 --> 02:04:03.380
<v Speaker 3>clarity of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't feel foggy and tired.</v>

2990
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just sticking with this.</v>

2991
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And plus I bring,</v>

2992
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is the,</v>

2993
02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>this is just some cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Quito cream run to try to get me</v>

2997
02:04:17.031 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It is sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got the Stevia in it.</v>

2998
02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:19.880
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the one?</v>

2999
02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:22.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the one I gave it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave that shit to her.</v>

3000
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also gave her some Quito Ios,</v>

3001
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:26.143
<v Speaker 3>which is something you that he'd dumped </v>
<v Speaker 3>in water it same company right now it's </v>

3002
02:04:28.711 --> 02:04:31.220
<v Speaker 3>a different company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a ketones.</v>

3003
02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but exogenous ketones are good.</v>

3004
02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't kill Canada.</v>

3005
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Quito can is great.</v>

3006
02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:39.360
<v Speaker 3>I have that stuff that's good to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep you going.</v>

3007
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.500
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3008
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:41.663
<v Speaker 3>dom d'agostino who's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I was first </v>

3009
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:44.873
<v Speaker 3>intrigued by the Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm listening to him on a Tim Ferriss </v>

3010
02:04:47.521 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you haven't heard it,</v>

3011
02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:51.600
<v Speaker 3>dom's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

3012
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:52.434
<v Speaker 3>super fucking smart guy and so dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the pros and the benefits of a </v>

3013
02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:01.680
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diets and staying in Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

3014
02:05:01.681 --> 02:05:02.514
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is obviously on the fucking </v>

3015
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:03.841
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>

3016
02:05:03.841 --> 02:05:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I've got to really look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look into this.</v>

3017
02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:06.064
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be something to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for me there was a few like </v>

3018
02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:12.810
<v Speaker 3>undeniable benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the big ones is the way I feel in</v>

3019
02:05:12.811 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 3>between meals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

3020
02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not any type of crash.</v>

3021
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Have a constant energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3022
02:05:18.421 --> 02:05:21.300
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the constant energy or the know crash is</v>

3023
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:23.670
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also my hunger is not the same.</v>

3024
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.863
<v Speaker 3>Like I would get fucking famished where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would eat something and then four </v>

3025
02:05:28.261 --> 02:05:29.094
<v Speaker 3>hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five hours away when I was ready for my </v>

3026
02:05:30.151 --> 02:05:30.984
<v Speaker 3>next meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be famished where my body was </v>

3027
02:05:32.731 --> 02:05:34.590
<v Speaker 3>crashing at all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to fucking eat.</v>

3028
02:05:34.770 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't get like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen.</v>

3029
02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:38.423
<v Speaker 3>So I recognize that I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that I should probably get </v>

3030
02:05:41.071 --> 02:05:42.600
<v Speaker 3>some food in me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

3031
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm not compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that state,</v>

3032
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:47.310
<v Speaker 3>I can still have a very good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3033
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Which when I was on a carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose based system,</v>

3034
02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>my body was just not operating like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3035
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:54.473
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have a shit workout if I was </v>

3036
02:05:56.041 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 3>tired and I hadn't eaten anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to have some fruit before I</v>

3037
02:05:58.861 --> 02:05:59.694
<v Speaker 3>worked at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3038
02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 3>And so those two benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the big one was,</v>

3039
02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:06.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way my brain works,</v>

3040
02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.090
<v Speaker 3>it just feels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels less foggy.</v>

3041
02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cleaner state,</v>

3042
02:06:10.471 --> 02:06:11.304
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3043
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3044
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.903
<v Speaker 3>it's undeniable also that eating all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those carbohydrates has an effect on </v>

3045
02:06:16.741 --> 02:06:19.010
<v Speaker 3>your insulin sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3046
02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:21.480
<v Speaker 3>your body's just processing a fuckload </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

3047
02:06:21.970 --> 02:06:24.060
<v Speaker 3>You're all that bread and pasta and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

3048
02:06:24.061 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you are blowing it out all day,</v>

3049
02:06:27.781 --> 02:06:30.510
<v Speaker 3>if you're some crazy fucking ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon runner or some,</v>

3050
02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:35.040
<v Speaker 3>some dude who's doing crossfit four </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day or something like that,</v>

3051
02:06:35.041 --> 02:06:36.600
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3052
02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably be fine,</v>

3053
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:41.610
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's some real benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>to staying in Ketosis.</v>

3054
02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:42.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3055
02:06:42.781 --> 02:06:43.614
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really hooked on it so much so </v>

3056
02:06:44.931 --> 02:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>that I was testing my blood probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to four times a day,</v>

3057
02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:49.963
<v Speaker 1>which you fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just testing after I would eat </v>

3058
02:06:52.131 --> 02:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>certain foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3059
02:06:53.841 --> 02:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go in and say okay,</v>

3060
02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3061
02:06:57.260 --> 02:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>two and a half millimolar is right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep telling wise if I have a big salad,</v>

3062
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>but I put a ton of fat in there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I stay in Ketosis?</v>

3063
02:07:07.011 --> 02:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Like pushing the edges to see what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked me out.</v>

3064
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3065
02:07:10.881 --> 02:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I did find is I,</v>

3066
02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:13.453
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a glass of wine or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dinner and so I really wanted to </v>

3067
02:07:17.571 --> 02:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>see what wine we do with ketosis knocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>you right out of it.</v>

3068
02:07:20.151 --> 02:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

3069
02:07:21.201 --> 02:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm a really dry champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could stay in,</v>

3070
02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:26.413
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think champagne would keep you and you </v>

3071
02:07:28.131 --> 02:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>think like something with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has definitely.</v>

3072
02:07:30.801 --> 02:07:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It has to be on the drier side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking initially like a,</v>

3073
02:07:32.941 --> 02:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>a red wine would keep me in more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>say like a</v>

3074
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.120
<v Speaker 3>champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

3075
02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I would drop down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd still be,</v>

3076
02:07:39.341 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around 0.8</v>

3077
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 3>to 1.2,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there.</v>

3078
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:43.383
<v Speaker 3>Do you worry about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you check that on a regular basis or </v>

3079
02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:49.870
<v Speaker 3>do you just go on the way you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3080
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:50.733
<v Speaker 3>primarily in the way I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could always tell when I got kicked </v>

3081
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:54.064
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell when I ate something I </v>

3082
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3083
02:07:55.841 --> 02:07:59.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd be out and about and it would sneak </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on me.</v>

3084
02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:00.304
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have like a salad with like some </v>

3085
02:08:01.031 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>kind of dressing that I wasn't sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't taste too sweet.</v>

3086
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.343
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden I would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>this really bad crash if I got fully </v>

3087
02:08:07.601 --> 02:08:09.490
<v Speaker 3>kicked out of Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must be like super sensitive.</v>

3089
02:08:11.441 --> 02:08:12.274
<v Speaker 3>I was super since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would also get pretty deep pretty </v>

3090
02:08:14.201 --> 02:08:15.034
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could fast and get up into two </v>

3091
02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:20.800
<v Speaker 3>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three millimeters within 24 hours.</v>

3092
02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a real problem with those God damn</v>

3093
02:08:23.681 --> 02:08:25.000
<v Speaker 3>blood meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3094
02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:25.983
<v Speaker 3>Because the things that they use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prick your skin don't get through my </v>

3095
02:08:28.961 --> 02:08:31.330
<v Speaker 3>skin just said it's like a level eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

3096
02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I had to take it out of the thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stab myself.</v>

3097
02:08:34.091 --> 02:08:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>

3098
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I lift so much kettlebells that my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my skins are all,</v>

3099
02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.650
<v Speaker 3>it's all calloused and thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3100
02:08:40.670 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 3>So I'd like try to get in there and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to actually go with the top of</v>

3101
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:45.670
<v Speaker 3>my skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3102
02:08:45.671 --> 02:08:47.380
<v Speaker 3>like maybe that's the better way to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3103
02:08:47.381 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but it just seemed so fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've tried it all over the place.</v>

3104
02:08:50.441 --> 02:08:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I've done it on the sides before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the best way for you?</v>

3105
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.011
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's,</v>

3106
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:55.750
<v Speaker 3>it is the tips of the fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

3107
02:08:55.751 --> 02:08:56.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of Russian roulette like one </v>

3108
02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:58.900
<v Speaker 3>and I've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 is going to hurt.</v>

3109
02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:01.300
<v Speaker 3>So when you're doing it like five times </v>
<v Speaker 3>a day,</v>

3110
02:09:01.301 --> 02:09:04.330
<v Speaker 3>you would always kind of try and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different spots.</v>

3111
02:09:04.331 --> 02:09:05.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got annoying.</v>

3112
02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is annoying.</v>

3113
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Jab Myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I had,</v>

3114
02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I used to try the punch thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just wasn't doing anything right.</v>

3115
02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:13.413
<v Speaker 3>I would go right to the tip chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you squeak Bush even when you were </v>

3116
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>at that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3117
02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.700
<v Speaker 3>But is years of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3118
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.833
<v Speaker 3>lifting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like kettle bells or just so it's a </v>

3119
02:09:24.971 --> 02:09:25.804
<v Speaker 3>fat piece of iron and your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you just constantly getting roughed </v>

3120
02:09:28.811 --> 02:09:32.470
<v Speaker 3>up and I'm using powder right on chalk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's was all this grit.</v>

3121
02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.990
<v Speaker 3>It's all very thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the coding.</v>

3122
02:09:34.991 --> 02:09:38.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like the bottom of your feet stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>on top doing the top stair.</v>

3123
02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Is there a better way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the piece takes,</v>

3124
02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really didn't work that </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3125
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter if you know you're in </v>

3152
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:39.583
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to see it as a cup kicked </v>

<v Speaker 1>how long does it take you to recover?</v>

3158
02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:49.130
<v Speaker 1>A half day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half Day.</v>

3159
02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Half to three quarters of a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intermittent fast at all.</v>

3160
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

3163
02:10:56.691 --> 02:11:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do 24 a couple of times a month.</v>

3164
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:01.101
<v Speaker 1>Real?</v>

<v Speaker 1>three times a month.</v>

3166
02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And why do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because I keep,</v>

3167
02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:05.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he listened to ron as podcast and she </v>

3168
02:11:06.351 --> 02:11:09.650
<v Speaker 1>starts talking about like all the guests</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she has.</v>

3172
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.330
<v Speaker 1>like it can actually help clear out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>non precancerous cause kind of cells.</v>

3173
02:11:20.331 --> 02:11:23.430

<v Speaker 1>meditative state.</v>

3178
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a skill that might be a still,</v>

3201
02:12:23.331 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is scene in the movie where he gets</v>

3202
02:12:26.151 --> 02:12:30.500
<v Speaker 3>up out of bed and he is fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3203
02:12:30.501 --> 02:12:32.810
<v Speaker 3>is it possible to get that big without </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids?</v>

3204
02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.170
<v Speaker 3>If you're 20 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3205
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:36.283
<v Speaker 3>It war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are a fucking maniac and your 30 </v>

3206
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:44.240
<v Speaker 3>and you're in the gym all day long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're completely and totally dedicated.</v>

3207
02:12:44.241 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

3208
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:48.840
<v Speaker 3>But it's not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have a friend who was a,</v>

3221
02:13:11.661 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 3>weird gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3222
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:18.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3223
02:13:18.170 --> 02:13:19.003
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some stuff that you can get at </v>

3224
02:13:20.751 --> 02:13:24.710
<v Speaker 3>like Gnc and some of those places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is steroids.</v>

3225
02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3226
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Like what stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3227
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:31.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking shitload of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had Jeff Novitsky who was the guy who</v>

3228
02:13:31.291 --> 02:13:33.630
<v Speaker 3>busted Lance Armstrong and he works for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC now.</v>

3229
02:13:33.631 --> 02:13:34.464
<v Speaker 3>He works for Usada and he um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a website and then the youth </v>

3230
02:13:37.421 --> 02:13:38.254
<v Speaker 3>side of website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different supplements </v>

3231
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:41.333
<v Speaker 3>that contain products that are illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>products that will get you kicked out </v>

3232
02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:49.290
<v Speaker 3>because they are steroids in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing drugs while you,</v>

3233
02:13:49.370 --> 02:13:53.640
<v Speaker 3>the u s Ada website has like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3234
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.533
<v Speaker 3>alphabetically listed a through z and </v>
<v Speaker 3>each letter has just fucking shit loads </v>

3235
02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:01.674
<v Speaker 3>of different supplements that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy at any store and he local vitamin </v>

3236
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Shoppe that is likely to be filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

3237
02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:11.640
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's this stuff that I take,</v>

3238
02:14:11.641 --> 02:14:15.270
<v Speaker 3>I took it in like the early two </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands was called Mag 10.</v>

3239
02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:16.440
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made it illegal.</v>

3240
02:14:16.441 --> 02:14:20.130
<v Speaker 3>After awhile it was 100% steroids.</v>

3241
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has to be really bad for your liver</v>

3242
02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:25.590
<v Speaker 3>then since all most of them are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3243
02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:27.173
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see someone did gets that Jack </v>

3244
02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:30.324
<v Speaker 3>for a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they be concerned with not </v>

3245
02:14:32.970 --> 02:14:36.210
<v Speaker 3>doing it the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if the,</v>

3246
02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the goal here?</v>

3247
02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.290
<v Speaker 3>The goal here is you have to look like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn superhero.</v>

3248
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3249
02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:41.993
<v Speaker 3>So are you pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you prepared to not totally looked </v>

3250
02:14:44.491 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 3>like a superhero and tell everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least I did it naturally.</v>

3251
02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

3252
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:49.584
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>

3253
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:50.573
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do dead lifts on </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and take human growth </v>

3254
02:14:53.341 --> 02:14:55.500
<v Speaker 3>hormone and the reward is pretty high </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3255
02:14:55.501 --> 02:14:59.430
<v Speaker 3>And that you get paid $15 million or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is for any looked awesome.</v>

3256
02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:00.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not hating it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyone who thinks you're going to </v>

3257
02:15:03.751 --> 02:15:06.150
<v Speaker 3>achieve that kind of results without </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sorts,</v>

3258
02:15:06.151 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 3>especially like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3259
02:15:07.561 --> 02:15:11.730
<v Speaker 3>like how old you Jackman isn't he like </v>
<v Speaker 3>40 it's like 42 or something like that.</v>

3260
02:15:12.850 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some outliers,</v>

3261
02:15:14.881 --> 02:15:15.714
<v Speaker 3>there are some people that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the UFC when you find these guys </v>

3262
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:19.584
<v Speaker 3>and they just look unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like unbelievably ripped and huge </v>

3263
02:15:22.410 --> 02:15:23.243
<v Speaker 3>and they get into their late thirties </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they get popped and then some </v>

3264
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:27.360
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

3265
02:15:27.361 --> 02:15:29.270
<v Speaker 3>they just randomly test them and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>

3266
02:15:29.271 --> 02:15:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause w the way that UFC is set up now </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Novitsky,</v>

3267
02:15:32.610 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 3>they'll show up at your house at six </v>
<v Speaker 3>o'clock in the morning,</v>

3268
02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:35.100
<v Speaker 3>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3269
02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:36.180
<v Speaker 3>wake up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3270
02:15:36.181 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 3>we need some blood to p crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they test them.</v>

3271
02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:40.471
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3272
02:15:40.471 --> 02:15:42.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of these guys that are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that hasn't,</v>

3273
02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:43.253
<v Speaker 3>it's insanely short half life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll have something that a is </v>

3274
02:15:46.261 --> 02:15:48.960
<v Speaker 3>only a shows up in the system for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven hours.</v>

3275
02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:50.033
<v Speaker 3>So what they'll try to do is they'll try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take it like right before they go to </v>

3276
02:15:51.781 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 3>bed and then we'll get the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then,</v>

3277
02:15:54.181 --> 02:15:55.830
<v Speaker 3>but they'll fucking wake you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3278
02:15:56.010 --> 02:15:58.590
<v Speaker 3>They'll wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

3279
02:15:59.190 --> 02:16:00.023
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they want to find out </v>

3280
02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:04.290
<v Speaker 3>what's going on and we've exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I shouldn't say we have nothing to do</v>

3281
02:16:04.291 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've exposed,</v>

3282
02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:06.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous underlying sort of just a </v>

3283
02:16:10.771 --> 02:16:14.100
<v Speaker 3>standard operational procedure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

3284
02:16:14.101 --> 02:16:15.380
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

3285
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:19.080
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating the system.</v>

3286
02:16:19.110 --> 02:16:19.943
<v Speaker 3>Epo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff that Armstrong got caught </v>

3287
02:16:21.451 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 3>with or actually didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never got caught with anything.</v>

3288
02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to confess.</v>

3289
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.230
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of those cyclists take epo,</v>

3290
02:16:28.231 --> 02:16:30.790
<v Speaker 3>which jacks up your red blood cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>production.</v>

3291
02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:32.253
<v Speaker 3>There's just so many different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing the way the body functions </v>

3292
02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 3>both naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3293
02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 3>like with Ketosis and a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>methods and you know,</v>

3294
02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:43.870
<v Speaker 3>and then with exogenous chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see the documentary on steroids?</v>

3295
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.741
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bigger.</v>

3296
02:16:44.741 --> 02:16:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

3297
02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:48.130
<v Speaker 3>I had those guys here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would you think that's great.</v>

3298
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:49.630
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting.</v>

3299
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I've become friends with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3300
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just when you find out what,</v>

3301
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:58.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many different different types of </v>

3302
02:17:01.091 --> 02:17:01.924
<v Speaker 3>steroids there are and how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different people and totally different </v>

3303
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:04.984
<v Speaker 3>athletes are taking them and you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially throughout bodybuilding and </v>

3304
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:09.460
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you can call that a sport,</v>

3305
02:17:09.490 --> 02:17:11.350
<v Speaker 3>I guess you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of an activity more than it is</v>

3306
02:17:11.351 --> 02:17:15.040
<v Speaker 3>a sports kind of dying out though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like is it at least the,</v>

3307
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:17.950
<v Speaker 3>the crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy that they competed,</v>

3308
02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was definitely choosing,</v>

3309
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was,</v>

3310
02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 3>he said that the big bulky kind of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the top look and they're going more</v>

3311
02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:30.760
<v Speaker 3>for a more natural appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the hot thing now.</v>

3312
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Like Frank Zane or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3313
02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:33.964
<v Speaker 3>Frank Zane was famous in the arnold days</v>
<v Speaker 3>as being like the most symmetrical and </v>

3314
02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:43.050
<v Speaker 3>also like the more realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as close to like a Lee Haney who is</v>

3315
02:17:43.051 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>just just walking mass of muscle.</v>

3316
02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Zane was more,</v>

3317
02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:50.140
<v Speaker 3>it looked more sculpted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will look more like a,</v>

3318
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:52.870
<v Speaker 3>you have a photo of them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3319
02:17:52.871 --> 02:17:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's that guy?</v>

3320
02:17:54.490 --> 02:17:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on what touch point.</v>

3321
02:17:57.341 --> 02:17:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

3322
02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Well this guy is a crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sort of a bodybuilder,</v>

3323
02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.574
<v Speaker 3>but more of like a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has an eight hour arm workout where </v>

3324
02:18:06.941 --> 02:18:09.550
<v Speaker 3>he works out nothing but his arms for </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours.</v>

3325
02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His arms are massive.</v>

3326
02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's everything massive.</v>

3327
02:18:12.641 --> 02:18:15.220
<v Speaker 3>He's is a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some drugs there.</v>

3328
02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:16.420
<v Speaker 3>No way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3329
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:18.610
<v Speaker 3>That's totally legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3330
02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:19.031
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3331
02:18:19.031 --> 02:18:21.050
<v Speaker 3>he's brought it to the tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3332
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:22.510
<v Speaker 3>but lou,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>

3333
02:18:22.511 --> 02:18:23.344
<v Speaker 3>Frank Zane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll get an idea of what a lot of </v>

3334
02:18:26.051 --> 02:18:29.320
<v Speaker 3>people thought was like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect bodies.</v>

3335
02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.333
<v Speaker 3>So like Frank Zane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe that that is a body </v>

3336
02:18:33.461 --> 02:18:34.294
<v Speaker 3>that is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can attain that body without </v>

3337
02:18:35.951 --> 02:18:39.880
<v Speaker 3>steroids with strong dedication and </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

3338
02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of nutrition and the right way</v>

3339
02:18:43.301 --> 02:18:44.140
<v Speaker 3>to lift weights.</v>

3340
02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:45.093
<v Speaker 3>But Frank Zane never got ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 3>big like that is a regular size guy out </v>

3341
02:18:50.021 --> 02:18:52.210
<v Speaker 3>a lot of gyms like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3342
02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:53.103
<v Speaker 3>That's a regular size guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of like high level gyms like </v>

3343
02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:58.120
<v Speaker 3>that might not even be the biggest guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3344
02:18:58.121 --> 02:18:59.560
<v Speaker 3>It looks like there's drugs there </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

3345
02:18:59.590 --> 02:19:00.423
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3346
02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:04.690
<v Speaker 3>the shoulders are popped maybe most </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely,</v>

3347
02:19:04.691 --> 02:19:05.980
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

3348
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:07.001
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3349
02:19:07.001 --> 02:19:08.200
<v Speaker 3>that's attainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3350
02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:09.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible without drug little </v>

3351
02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:10.774
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that just means he's a very lean it </v>

3352
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>those little lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Striations.</v>

3353
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:16.870
<v Speaker 3>That's totally attainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without drugs.</v>

3354
02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.790
<v Speaker 3>There's a level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3355
02:19:18.791 --> 02:19:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to be really dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>

3356
02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:21.550
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

3357
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:25.840
<v Speaker 3>he's not that big man in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the people of today.</v>

3358
02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Now look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3359
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Now Google Dorian Yates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dorian Yates who was a fucking,</v>

3360
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.943

<v Speaker 3>interesting guy because he's super </v>

<v Speaker 3>honest about it.</v>

02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:45.610
<v Speaker 3>What in the fucking Christ look out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

3364
02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:53.150
<v Speaker 3>That's all drugs and dedication and </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus and lifting a 100% I mean,</v>

3365
02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.010
<v Speaker 3>you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just took Jay counselor.</v>

3366
02:19:55.011 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 3>You've seen Jay Cutler's legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3367
02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:57.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Type in Jay Cutler that those guys are </v>

3368
02:19:59.091 --> 02:20:00.280
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3369
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:02.023
<v Speaker 3>Or Tom Platz ever seen that guy's legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Platz has the most ridiculous legs </v>

3370
02:20:07.161 --> 02:20:07.994
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

3371
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

3372
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I just got some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3373
02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.900
<v Speaker 3>that's all like horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3374
02:20:14.901 --> 02:20:19.310
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a maniac in the gym on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the log of that fucking picture.</v>

3375
02:20:19.311 --> 02:20:21.050
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3376
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is also,</v>

3377
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:24.283
<v Speaker 3>this is also like a mass movement of </v>
<v Speaker 3>body dysmorphia because it's not just </v>

3378
02:20:30.171 --> 02:20:33.320
<v Speaker 3>that these guys are trying to get as big</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they can.</v>

3379
02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:38.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they see themselves the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way other people see them either.</v>

3380
02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:38.924
<v Speaker 3>Cause like sometimes they freak out when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not in perfect shape and they </v>

3381
02:20:42.111 --> 02:20:42.944
<v Speaker 3>want to cover their bodies up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweaters and stuff and they don't want </v>

3382
02:20:45.681 --> 02:20:49.340
<v Speaker 3>anybody looking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an anorexia thing in a way,</v>

3383
02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:52.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's still like better than 99.9%</v>
<v Speaker 3>of humans on earth,</v>

3384
02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 3>even when they're not in peak shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3385
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3386
02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 3>but to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3387
02:20:57.201 --> 02:20:58.920
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're used to judging each other.</v>

3388
02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.970
<v Speaker 3>So harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laid,</v>

3389
02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>they have a little bit of extra body </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

3390
02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:04.490
<v Speaker 3>They start to freak crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3391
02:21:04.491 --> 02:21:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean back to Hugh Jackman and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3392
02:21:07.311 --> 02:21:08.300
<v Speaker 3>this training thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3393
02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:09.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fantastic way to get your body </v>

3394
02:21:11.871 --> 02:21:12.704
<v Speaker 3>really lean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things he was in </v>

3395
02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:15.320
<v Speaker 3>that movie was super lean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.710
<v Speaker 3>So he was on a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing the intermittent fasting.</v>

3397
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:21.860
<v Speaker 3>And so he was doing 16 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>

3398
02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:22.723
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3399
02:21:22.850 --> 02:21:23.683
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on a ketogenic diet as well as </v>

3400
02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3401
02:21:26.121 --> 02:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he was saying Kenogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3402
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:28.423
<v Speaker 3>And what was the benefit of doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>16 hour fasting without a key leading </v>

3403
02:21:30.891 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just leaning up.</v>

3404
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.553
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wonder if that would affect </v>

3405
02:21:34.731 --> 02:21:37.850
<v Speaker 3>without getting your body into a state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ketosis.</v>

3406
02:21:37.851 --> 02:21:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that would affect the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body put on muscle mass.</v>

3407
02:21:41.390 --> 02:21:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

3408
02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3409
02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:45.873
<v Speaker 3>there's also a problem that for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time doctors were calling </v>

3410
02:21:49.341 --> 02:21:53.120
<v Speaker 3>bullshit on fasting and they just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of information.</v>

3411
02:21:53.121 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 3>But they were like so quick to poo poo </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and like,</v>

3412
02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fasting has no med.</v>

3413
02:21:58.491 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 3>I remember this guy telling me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a doctor goes,</v>

3414
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:02.054
<v Speaker 3>fasting has no medical benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body exists on nutrients and when </v>

3415
02:22:05.841 --> 02:22:06.674
<v Speaker 3>you deny your body nutrients and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you're somehow under their </v>

3416
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 3>cleansing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your system is just a bunch of bunk.</v>

3417
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was wrong.</v>

3418
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a fucking doctor.</v>

3419
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.450
<v Speaker 3>That means almost all doctors are five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years behind the science though,</v>

3420
02:22:17.451 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3421
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:19.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the,</v>

3422
02:22:19.651 --> 02:22:23.570
<v Speaker 3>the thing is how much education did they</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have on nutrition,</v>

3423
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:26.720
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And two hours that it's really small.</v>

3424
02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:28.890
<v Speaker 3>It is like that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3425
02:22:28.891 --> 02:22:30.560
<v Speaker 3>a quarter of a semester or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3426
02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:31.403
<v Speaker 3>Something really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're talking to an oncologist </v>

3427
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.863
<v Speaker 3>and the oncologist starts poopooing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>value of phytonutrients and certain </v>

3428
02:22:38.281 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 3>vitamins to combat cancer and he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay on top of the cutting edge of it.</v>

3429
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:44.303
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are so weird with what they know </v>

3430
02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:48.990
<v Speaker 3>that they believe that what they know is</v>
<v Speaker 3>all there is out there.</v>

3431
02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:50.273
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a discussion with this woman </v>

3432
02:22:52.111 --> 02:22:54.150
<v Speaker 3>and she just did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

3433
02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:56.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about um,</v>

3434
02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this animal that they found the Congo,</v>

3435
02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:01.584
<v Speaker 3>it's called the Bondo ape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this enormous chimpanzee </v>

3436
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:07.290
<v Speaker 3>documented like hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have DNA photos,</v>

3437
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:09.330
<v Speaker 3>camera trap pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>

3438
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:12.510
<v Speaker 3>they've got the skull of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know it's real animal.</v>

3439
02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:14.920
<v Speaker 3>And this woman was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it.</v>

3440
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 3>She was mocking it.</v>

3441
02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:17.400
<v Speaker 3>She was mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3442
02:23:17.401 --> 02:23:20.770
<v Speaker 3>what could kind of fringe things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to school for anthropology.</v>

3443
02:23:20.771 --> 02:23:21.604
<v Speaker 3>Like I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well you're obviously not on the </v>

3444
02:23:22.681 --> 02:23:23.514
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you went to school 20 years </v>

3445
02:23:25.381 --> 02:23:26.940
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I told her,</v>

3446
02:23:26.941 --> 02:23:27.900
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go google it.</v>

3447
02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Go Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check it these websites.</v>

3448
02:23:29.490 --> 02:23:30.750
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>

3449
02:23:30.751 --> 02:23:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to,</v>

3450
02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:32.573
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll do it in front of you and then </v>

3451
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:34.194
<v Speaker 3>will you shut the fuck up and I show you</v>
<v Speaker 3>photos cause this is giant chimpanzee </v>

3452
02:23:38.131 --> 02:23:38.964
<v Speaker 3>that they found this one rare area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Congo that's of really old photo </v>

3453
02:23:43.021 --> 02:23:43.531
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3454
02:23:43.531 --> 02:23:44.364
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a better photo look at the size </v>

3455
02:23:46.471 --> 02:23:51.060
<v Speaker 3>of that fucking chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that thing is goddamn huge.</v>

3456
02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:52.223
<v Speaker 3>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy named Carl Amon who's a </v>

3457
02:23:54.330 --> 02:23:55.163
<v Speaker 3>Swiss wildlife photographer who set up </v>
<v Speaker 3>some camera traps and he got a picture </v>

3458
02:23:58.261 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 3>of one of them walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing on the side,</v>

3459
02:24:01.021 --> 02:24:02.970
<v Speaker 3>the balls on that huge nuts.</v>

3460
02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not even a good picture.</v>

3461
02:24:05.401 --> 02:24:07.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a kind of a blurry picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some better ones have it.</v>

3462
02:24:08.250 --> 02:24:09.083
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3463
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.200
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormous chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a like a subspecies that,</v>

3464
02:24:13.201 --> 02:24:14.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out to be,</v>

3465
02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:17.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoys walking upright as well.</v>

3466
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:20.040
<v Speaker 3>They see the far right far right upper </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper deck.</v>

3467
02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the camera trap photo.</v>

3468
02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 3>That's one of them walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go full screen on that,</v>

3469
02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:26.653
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does work.</v>

3470
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:27.623
<v Speaker 3>That's one of 'em walking upright and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they said that fucking thing was six </v>

3471
02:24:31.591 --> 02:24:35.610
<v Speaker 3>feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is an enormous chimpanzee.</v>

3472
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.473
<v Speaker 3>But the point is this woman who said she</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to school for anthropology was </v>

3473
02:24:39.511 --> 02:24:41.820
<v Speaker 3>mocking this when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and I was like,</v>

3474
02:24:41.821 --> 02:24:42.680
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

3475
02:24:42.681 --> 02:24:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something I'm making up.</v>

3476
02:24:44.370 --> 02:24:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cryptozoology.com</v>

3477
02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:49.080
<v Speaker 3>like this is national geographic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>

3478
02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:50.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a bunch of different </v>

3479
02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:52.853
<v Speaker 3>scientists that are studying this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to find out how many of them </v>

3480
02:24:55.051 --> 02:24:57.660
<v Speaker 3>there are and they don't have any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in captivity.</v>

3481
02:24:57.661 --> 02:24:58.494
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a really dangerous part of the </v>

3482
02:25:00.841 --> 02:25:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Congo where it's warlords and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3483
02:25:04.410 --> 02:25:05.243
<v Speaker 3>shootings and killings and rapings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's a very dangerous spot to </v>

3484
02:25:08.761 --> 02:25:09.594
<v Speaker 3>get to and they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point being when someone gets a </v>

3485
02:25:12.961 --> 02:25:13.794
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of information on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject and then they don't stay up on </v>

3486
02:25:16.651 --> 02:25:19.290
<v Speaker 3>it and they still want to cling to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>old information,</v>

3487
02:25:19.291 --> 02:25:22.830
<v Speaker 3>like this is all there is like you do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real disservice to the other people that</v>

3488
02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

3489
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.050
<v Speaker 1>to be the one who's the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3490
02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3491
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:28.954
<v Speaker 1>The fascinating thing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's starting to come around </v>

3492
02:25:30.851 --> 02:25:32.380
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy that just,</v>

3493
02:25:32.381 --> 02:25:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm just beat cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a stage three lymphoma.</v>

3494
02:25:37.450 --> 02:25:38.283
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went in for his first chemo </v>

3495
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:42.003
<v Speaker 1>treatments and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get totally sick when you're </v>

3496
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:45.784
<v Speaker 1>doing chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was some research that come </v>

3497
02:25:47.861 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 1>out and talk about fasting prior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemo and how it helps with the,</v>

3498
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:51.783
<v Speaker 1>with the therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he started fasting two days prior to </v>

3499
02:25:54.191 --> 02:25:55.024
<v Speaker 1>doing chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do 48 hours and then go into </v>

3500
02:25:56.411 --> 02:26:01.120
<v Speaker 1>chemo and world of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was this doctor,</v>

3501
02:26:01.470 --> 02:26:02.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out a bunch of papers and you can </v>

3502
02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:04.414
<v Speaker 1>even watch the videos on youtube of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these rats fasting prior to chemo and </v>

3503
02:26:07.601 --> 02:26:08.434
<v Speaker 1>that the difference between the fast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>group in the non fasting group is like </v>

3504
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:12.050
<v Speaker 1>night and day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group that fast,</v>

3505
02:26:12.051 --> 02:26:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it is like running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

3506
02:26:13.871 --> 02:26:16.990
<v Speaker 1>drinking afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after they had the chemo treatment,</v>

3507
02:26:16.991 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 1>the other group is just on its side like</v>
<v Speaker 1>deathly ill.</v>

3508
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really crazy.</v>

3509
02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:25.330
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's benefits going into chemo too,</v>

3510
02:26:25.331 --> 02:26:27.340
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda was talking about that.</v>

3511
02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:28.293
<v Speaker 3>She was talking about Doctor Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrick was talking about that there's </v>

3512
02:26:32.410 --> 02:26:33.243
<v Speaker 3>some pretty significant benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just for combating cancer but also </v>

3513
02:26:35.741 --> 02:26:40.240
<v Speaker 3>for dealing with chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing how many tinkers there</v>

3514
02:26:40.241 --> 02:26:43.840
<v Speaker 3>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Dr Dom D'agostino guys who are just</v>

3515
02:26:43.841 --> 02:26:46.660
<v Speaker 3>super fucking smart but also tweaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own body.</v>

3516
02:26:46.661 --> 02:26:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

3517
02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:49.230
<v Speaker 1>if you had Peter Attia on the show yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3518
02:26:49.350 --> 02:26:50.430
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's another one that,</v>

3519
02:26:50.431 --> 02:26:51.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his law?</v>

3520
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peter Attia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell it?</v>

3521
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look it up.</v>

3522
02:26:55.410 --> 02:26:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Att I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

3523
02:26:57.550 --> 02:27:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that he's been on a Tim ferriss show.</v>

3524
02:27:00.301 --> 02:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>He's another body hacker slash kido </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3525
02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy.</v>

3526
02:27:05.161 --> 02:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>He was just on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda is a podcast as well.</v>

3527
02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3528
02:27:07.530 --> 02:27:08.363
<v Speaker 3>I'll find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of those people out </v>

3529
02:27:09.391 --> 02:27:13.720
<v Speaker 3>there and I know these doctors that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>also into physical fitness and you know,</v>

3530
02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:14.693
<v Speaker 3>exercise is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about a Tim Ferriss </v>

3531
02:27:16.441 --> 02:27:19.700
<v Speaker 3>podcasts was dom d'agostino talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about fasting for five days.</v>

3532
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Then doing like 500 pounds of dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifts.</v>

3533
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>

3534
02:27:23.791 --> 02:27:26.370
<v Speaker 3>So crazy he would think of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't eaten in five days.</v>

3535
02:27:26.371 --> 02:27:30.210
<v Speaker 3>It just being a barely alive thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinging to life,</v>

3536
02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:32.350
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3537
02:27:32.390 --> 02:27:33.223
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really fascinating how we're </v>

3538
02:27:35.131 --> 02:27:35.964
<v Speaker 3>learning also that the body has a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different ways that it can acquire </v>

3539
02:27:39.061 --> 02:27:39.894
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it can acquire food through </v>

3540
02:27:40.531 --> 02:27:44.220
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates or fuel rather through </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates or through fat,</v>

3541
02:27:44.730 --> 02:27:45.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3542
02:27:45.211 --> 02:27:46.044
<v Speaker 3>and it can go back and forth in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things and just the reaction that </v>

3543
02:27:49.051 --> 02:27:49.884
<v Speaker 3>your body has that we think is normal to</v>
<v Speaker 3>common everyday foods that are just </v>

3544
02:27:53.671 --> 02:27:55.350
<v Speaker 3>really fucking terrible for you.</v>

3545
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:57.090
<v Speaker 3>But we all eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3546
02:27:57.990 --> 02:28:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could deal occasionally every now and</v>

3547
02:28:00.361 --> 02:28:02.040
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't when I,</v>

3548
02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:04.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I really committed to it was when I</v>

3549
02:28:04.951 --> 02:28:05.784
<v Speaker 3>met Mark Sisson and I did the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him and I really started talking </v>

3550
02:28:08.341 --> 02:28:11.220
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he really started talking about the</v>

3551
02:28:11.221 --> 02:28:13.860
<v Speaker 3>benefits of it and I just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3552
02:28:13.861 --> 02:28:15.570
<v Speaker 3>it's worth a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just give it a shot.</v>

3553
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:16.583
<v Speaker 3>And within five or six days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that this was going to be </v>

3554
02:28:18.601 --> 02:28:20.430
<v Speaker 3>probably the way I eat for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

3555
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3556
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:22.933
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really hit me was</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad I felt when I wasn't taking in </v>

3557
02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>sugar for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3558
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have I got a headache?</v>

3559
02:28:30.081 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized,</v>

3560
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body is addicted to this crap.</v>

3561
02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar is the devil.</v>

3562
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3563
02:28:38.211 --> 02:28:38.830
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3564
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you keep up with the data as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3565
02:28:40.581 --> 02:28:41.414
<v Speaker 1>but just like every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like every few months was </v>

3566
02:28:42.831 --> 02:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>another report that comes out and talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how toxic and evil it is.</v>

3567
02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:47.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's so yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3568
02:28:47.571 --> 02:28:48.404
<v Speaker 1>Yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have a fucking weird biological </v>

3569
02:28:49.461 --> 02:28:50.271
<v Speaker 1>trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3570
02:28:50.271 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but we never used to eat it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't refine it to the level that we</v>

3571
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:55.910
<v Speaker 1>do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3572
02:28:55.911 --> 02:28:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3573
02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:58.003
<v Speaker 1>you know what's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it sugar is yummy and ice cream is </v>

3574
02:29:01.071 --> 02:29:02.990
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fruit,</v>

3575
02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 1>fruit is like one of the best tasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you can get your hands on.</v>

3576
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.943
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a nice ripe peach is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fantastic things in so </v>

3577
02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:17.420
<v Speaker 1>underappreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so underrated,</v>

3578
02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:18.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is the way you're supposed to </v>

3579
02:29:20.601 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 1>get your sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the only way.</v>

3580
02:29:22.671 --> 02:29:23.504
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really want sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really supposed to eat like a </v>

3581
02:29:25.881 --> 02:29:27.080
<v Speaker 1>fresh orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3582
02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:28.183
<v Speaker 1>And they taste amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that should be our dessert every </v>

3583
02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:31.640
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3584
02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just as good as chocolate cake.</v>

3585
02:29:34.131 --> 02:29:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you have it in your head.</v>

3586
02:29:36.711 --> 02:29:40.660
<v Speaker 1>The chocolate cake is that dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that frosting and look at it,</v>

3587
02:29:40.661 --> 02:29:44.360
<v Speaker 1>it's moist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love chocolate and I've started to eat</v>

3588
02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:47.810
<v Speaker 1>100% chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no sugar added.</v>

3589
02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:48.973
<v Speaker 1>But here's the funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 100% chocolate that you've ever </v>

3590
02:29:51.171 --> 02:29:54.830
<v Speaker 1>tasted or anyone else out there has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasted is the baker's chocolate.</v>

3591
02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the stuff that you get at the store</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's made exclusively for baking.</v>

3592
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:02.180
<v Speaker 1>It's super bitter and harsh and nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and burnt.</v>

3593
02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I was talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate maker,</v>

3594
02:30:05.631 --> 02:30:08.360
<v Speaker 1>this guy that owns a fruition chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in New York,</v>

3595
02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3596
02:30:10.611 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 1>they just beat the hell out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they overwrote it.</v>

3597
02:30:12.891 --> 02:30:15.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for consumption like that.</v>

3598
02:30:15.201 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes a hundred percent chocolate bar</v>

3599
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:21.350
<v Speaker 1>that is actually palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

3600
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a ship.</v>

3601
02:30:22.810 --> 02:30:23.650
<v Speaker 1>What's it do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ship,</v>

3602
02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:24.860
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>

3603
02:30:24.890 --> 02:30:26.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of the company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fruition.</v>

3604
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Fruition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they make 100%,</v>

3605
02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:31.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sugar added chocolate bar.</v>

3606
02:30:31.971 --> 02:30:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3607
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:35.180
<v Speaker 1>like a little quarter piece of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

3608
02:30:35.181 --> 02:30:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate is a great,</v>

3609
02:30:36.951 --> 02:30:38.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a great little pick-me-up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has a little bit of caffeine in there as</v>

3610
02:30:38.901 --> 02:30:39.471
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3611
02:30:39.471 --> 02:30:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's bad for dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3612
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:42.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3613
02:30:42.010 --> 02:30:43.970
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to have my dog's stomach pumped.</v>

3614
02:30:44.690 --> 02:30:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

3615
02:30:46.631 --> 02:30:48.230
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my poor little labradoodle.</v>

3616
02:30:48.231 --> 02:30:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's gone through raccoon attack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

3617
02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.000
<v Speaker 1>We live of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet,</v>

3618
02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:54.710
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3619
02:30:54.711 --> 02:30:56.360
<v Speaker 1>he's so friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We left a,</v>

3620
02:30:56.361 --> 02:30:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate bars,</v>

3621
02:30:59.031 --> 02:31:03.020
<v Speaker 1>the whole foods like dark chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 80% and he just,</v>

3622
02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:05.600
<v Speaker 1>we came home in the rappers like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the floor and I'm like,</v>

3623
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:07.580
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I called,</v>

3624
02:31:07.581 --> 02:31:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I called the vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3625
02:31:08.421 --> 02:31:09.254
<v Speaker 1>bring him in right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brought him down there two days in the </v>

3626
02:31:12.651 --> 02:31:14.800
<v Speaker 1>hospital on Ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3627
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Like six times the lethal dose or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3628
02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a small little labradoodle.</v>

3629
02:31:20.430 --> 02:31:21.263
<v Speaker 1>And did they put charcoal in the stomach</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had to give him charcoal </v>

3630
02:31:24.001 --> 02:31:26.700
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Towels really brutal.</v>

3631
02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently just jacks your little </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearts.</v>

3632
02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what kills him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little harder.</v>

3633
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Do seizures and they have all that.</v>

3634
02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:36.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And chocolate chocolate.</v>

3635
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's like the only saving grace of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Hershey's or something.</v>

3636
02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>They're not really chocolate anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like 2% or whatever.</v>

3637
02:31:43.321 --> 02:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You know when dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when I called they're like,</v>

3638
02:31:47.251 --> 02:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>well what type of chocolate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like,</v>

3639
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>cause if it's like a Hershey's bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want me.</v>

3640
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh he might throw up but be,</v>

3641
02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:56.190
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know if it's Hershey's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bars,</v>

3642
02:31:56.191 --> 02:31:57.024
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the lesser like almost all sugar </v>

3643
02:31:58.831 --> 02:32:01.850
<v Speaker 1>bars with milk don't have a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate.</v>

3644
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Not like an 80% dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic,</v>

3645
02:32:05.281 --> 02:32:08.040
<v Speaker 1>free trade artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anal bar from whole foods.</v>

3646
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:11.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole nother level that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real chocolate.</v>

3647
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3648
02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:14.340
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3649
02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:16.520
<v Speaker 3>that's a good chocolate though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those things.</v>

3650
02:32:16.521 --> 02:32:18.050
<v Speaker 3>A little cocoa nibs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3651
02:32:18.051 --> 02:32:20.820
<v Speaker 3>the little nibs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tasty.</v>

3652
02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3653
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to avoid everything.</v>

3654
02:32:25.111 --> 02:32:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than fruit.</v>

3655
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:27.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3656
02:32:27.630 --> 02:32:31.350
<v Speaker 3>so you do fruit in Ketosis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it will not be sharing out.</v>

3657
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I'll do blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mangos occasionally they knock you out,</v>

3658
02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:37.523
<v Speaker 3>it'll definitely knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not as bad as refined sugar </v>

3659
02:32:39.871 --> 02:32:40.430
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fruit,</v>

3660
02:32:40.430 --> 02:32:41.690
<v Speaker 3>fruit toast versus secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3661
02:32:41.691 --> 02:32:42.511
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

3662
02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with getting knocked out.</v>

3663
02:32:46.530 --> 02:32:47.363
<v Speaker 3>My concern was like what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the Diet that my body functions </v>

3664
02:32:51.301 --> 02:32:54.330
<v Speaker 3>the best on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I feel when I work out?</v>

3665
02:32:54.510 --> 02:32:57.570
<v Speaker 3>How do I feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just throughout the day and for me,</v>

3666
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:59.460
<v Speaker 3>no sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big one.</v>

3667
02:32:59.490 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Avoid all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Pasta,</v>

3668
02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:04.120
<v Speaker 3>no bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut all that stuff out and uh,</v>

3669
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:04.973
<v Speaker 3>no rice.</v>

3670
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:06.270
<v Speaker 3>When I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

3671
02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to fuck with me too much</v>

3672
02:33:09.451 --> 02:33:13.020
<v Speaker 3>if I have like a pear or a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3673
02:33:13.021 --> 02:33:14.580
<v Speaker 3>a little bit in yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3674
02:33:14.581 --> 02:33:17.190
<v Speaker 3>if you have like a large bowl of yogurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and blueberries,</v>

3675
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.350
<v Speaker 3>realistically you're getting too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

3676
02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but too much sugar for what it's not.</v>

3677
02:33:21.361 --> 02:33:23.280
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fuck my body up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3678
02:33:23.310 --> 02:33:24.143
<v Speaker 3>But it's gonna knock me out of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I take exogenous ketones and I </v>

3679
02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:30.240
<v Speaker 3>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I want to get knocked out.</v>

3680
02:33:30.241 --> 02:33:33.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a slump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just take exogenous ketones.</v>

3681
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Casino has his own brand now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the kid can have staff and now he has</v>

3682
02:33:37.501 --> 02:33:38.460
<v Speaker 3>his own brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3683
02:33:38.461 --> 02:33:39.271
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3684
02:33:39.271 --> 02:33:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Key Key technics.</v>

3685
02:33:41.170 --> 02:33:42.870
<v Speaker 3>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just bought it.</v>

3686
02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I just had it delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried it yet,</v>

3687
02:33:44.701 --> 02:33:47.610
<v Speaker 3>but I've been doing Kido s which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another company,</v>

3688
02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:49.560
<v Speaker 3>they need to come up with a seminar for </v>
<v Speaker 3>these products.</v>

3689
02:33:49.561 --> 02:33:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the key to Cana?</v>

3690
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

3691
02:33:53.010 --> 02:33:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call it is poured in the water.</v>

3692
02:33:55.111 --> 02:33:56.970
<v Speaker 3>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they taste good.</v>

3693
02:33:57.060 --> 02:33:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't count as good.</v>

3694
02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:00.660
<v Speaker 1>But I heard some of them are really jet </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>

3695
02:34:00.661 --> 02:34:01.494
<v Speaker 1>He Nasty.</v>

3696
02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Quito s is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not the best taste and stuff</v>

3697
02:34:04.731 --> 02:34:06.900
<v Speaker 3>in the world like Gatorade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not awful.</v>

3698
02:34:06.930 --> 02:34:07.763
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

3699
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:09.023
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my main concern is predominantly making </v>

3700
02:34:12.511 --> 02:34:14.670
<v Speaker 3>sure I'm eating healthy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just making sure that I,</v>

3701
02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:18.850
<v Speaker 3>and then I also have to really vet out </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the information when it comes to</v>

3702
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:21.480
<v Speaker 3>increasing the Mitochondria in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

3703
02:34:21.481 --> 02:34:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Like is that all real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3704
02:34:23.261 --> 02:34:24.094
<v Speaker 3>And I need to find the pros and cons are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the detractors of these ideas because </v>

3705
02:34:28.291 --> 02:34:29.790
<v Speaker 3>there some of the things that system was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

3706
02:34:29.791 --> 02:34:30.371
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3707
02:34:30.371 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta look that up.</v>

3708
02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:33.850
<v Speaker 3>And Kyle Kingsbury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

3709
02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:36.550
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who's a former UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter is a very,</v>

3710
02:34:36.551 --> 02:34:40.660
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy who was also been Quito </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of years now.</v>

3711
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I have a few friends that are athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real high level athletes.</v>

3712
02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:46.330
<v Speaker 3>My friend Danny proper coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a former,</v>

3713
02:34:46.331 --> 02:34:49.870
<v Speaker 3>a Jujitsu world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been ketogenic for the past year.</v>

3714
02:34:49.871 --> 02:34:53.110
<v Speaker 3>He's really dedicated and he takes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Kito Kana stuff,</v>

3715
02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:56.860
<v Speaker 3>but he's just a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced that's the way it's the way to</v>

3716
02:34:56.861 --> 02:34:58.420
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny man.</v>

3717
02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:01.780
<v Speaker 3>How many people like fight like cats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs about this online?</v>

3718
02:35:02.050 --> 02:35:05.070
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a Mac versus pc thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3719
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it comes down to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just how you,</v>

3720
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.890
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you personally feel on it.</v>

3721
02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always having that,</v>

3722
02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:12.730
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3723
02:35:12.731 --> 02:35:14.740
<v Speaker 3>it's afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a slump.</v>

3724
02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm mentally a little foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3725
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:20.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I attribute a lot of that too.</v>

3726
02:35:20.170 --> 02:35:23.380
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the refined carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating 100% and sugar.</v>

3727
02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:25.680
<v Speaker 3>You get rid of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3728
02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just sharper,</v>

3729
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:28.570
<v Speaker 3>sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3730
02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:29.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said about the cold therapy and </v>

3731
02:35:30.251 --> 02:35:31.550
<v Speaker 3>the mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 20% boosts,</v>

3732
02:35:31.551 --> 02:35:34.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like a 20% boost in just mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>clarity and sharpness.</v>

3733
02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For my own personal experience,</v>

3734
02:35:36.431 --> 02:35:39.190
<v Speaker 3>my own experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has been the biggest factor.</v>

3735
02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:40.840
<v Speaker 3>The biggest factor has been cutting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

3736
02:35:41.050 --> 02:35:43.270
<v Speaker 3>cutting out sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting out refined carbs,</v>

3737
02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:47.320
<v Speaker 3>all that had a massive positive benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you know,</v>

3738
02:35:47.321 --> 02:35:49.060
<v Speaker 3>a little fruit in a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

3739
02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I think fruit is your advice though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Vice.</v>

3740
02:35:51.491 --> 02:35:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You have anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3741
02:35:52.601 --> 02:35:55.030
<v Speaker 3>do you ever do pizza every once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while?</v>

3742
02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:56.500
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3743
02:35:56.501 --> 02:35:57.190
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3744
02:35:57.190 --> 02:36:02.190
<v Speaker 3>I went a good solid 55 days strict until</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Mexico.</v>

3745
02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:05.440
<v Speaker 3>And then when I went to Mexico I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>had some tortillas.</v>

3746
02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3747
02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:09.250
<v Speaker 3>But even then I chip seal bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I tell you what,</v>

3748
02:36:09.251 --> 02:36:10.480
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I ate the Tortillas,</v>

3749
02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I had some dessert there when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>there too.</v>

3750
02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3751
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have it for,</v>

3752
02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:17.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost two months and then you do have </v>

3753
02:36:18.761 --> 02:36:18.910
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3754
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Like all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I ate a brick.</v>

3755
02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:21.693
<v Speaker 3>Did you skyrocket out with like some kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I like to have when he was down </v>

3756
02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:27.700
<v Speaker 3>there and bring any with me now I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughed it.</v>

3757
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:28.683
<v Speaker 3>I just decided to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be down here on vacation </v>

3758
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:33.250
<v Speaker 3>with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to drink Margarita is and</v>

3759
02:36:33.251 --> 02:36:35.130
<v Speaker 3>go fishing and have a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3760
02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:35.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving a fuck about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and I needed like a mental break </v>

3761
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:41.410
<v Speaker 3>because I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like three,</v>

3762
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.440
<v Speaker 3>essentially three occupations and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I managed them consecutively and it's,</v>

3763
02:36:47.381 --> 02:36:50.050
<v Speaker 3>they're all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy them,</v>

3764
02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think that just the sheer rpms </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm operating at all the time needs</v>

3765
02:36:56.290 --> 02:36:57.123
<v Speaker 3>brakes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning as I get older to get </v>

3766
02:36:59.291 --> 02:37:02.110
<v Speaker 3>better at just shutting all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3767
02:37:02.111 --> 02:37:03.580

<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

3776
02:37:20.271 --> 02:37:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I committed to that thing and I'm not </v>

3779
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:27.410
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3782
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:32.930
<v Speaker 1>how many years was that on the air for </v>
<v Speaker 1>six years?</v>

3783
02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>148 episodes.</v>

3784
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And then we came back and did it again </v>
<v Speaker 3>for six more episodes.</v>

3785
02:37:39.690 --> 02:37:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3786
02:37:41.581 --> 02:37:44.160
<v Speaker 3>now I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it less and less now.</v>

3787
02:37:44.161 --> 02:37:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Almost everything I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

3788
02:37:45.481 --> 02:37:47.820
<v Speaker 3>really enjoyed doing and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that helps.</v>

3789
02:37:47.890 --> 02:37:50.730
<v Speaker 3>That helps a lot if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard.</v>

3790
02:37:50.731 --> 02:37:51.770
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3791
02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:54.270
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not where their money is.</v>

3792
02:37:54.271 --> 02:37:56.340
<v Speaker 3>Their money comes from things that make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them uncomfortable.</v>

3793
02:37:56.370 --> 02:37:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3794
02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:58.650
<v Speaker 3>their money comes from things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't enjoy,</v>

3795
02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but they just happened to be good at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or understand really well.</v>

3796
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:02.663
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a treat in such a huge </v>

3797
02:38:05.370 --> 02:38:08.520
<v Speaker 3>blessing in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I hate that word blessing.</v>

3798
02:38:08.850 --> 02:38:09.683
<v Speaker 3>But it's such a huge positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can find something you actually </v>

3799
02:38:13.801 --> 02:38:17.700
<v Speaker 3>enjoy and that is actually how you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>your living God so lucky.</v>

3800
02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 3>So lucky to be able to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>so few people have that where they can,</v>

<v Speaker 1>been to in Tokyo and it is this guy,</v>

3986
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:32.930
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>

3987
02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I call him like the Gyro of Coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nocero this Sushi guy.</v>

3988
02:45:36.250 --> 02:45:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So he does something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ferments his coffee beans.</v>

3989
02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:43.600
<v Speaker 1>So he ferments them for I think three or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four months.</v>

3990
02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're not fresh and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>pungent and oily.</v>

3991
02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And then he does a 20 minute like water </v>
<v Speaker 1>pour over in front of you 20 minutes.</v>

3992
02:45:53.501 --> 02:45:54.334
<v Speaker 1>So they don't speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk in there and all you can say </v>

3993
02:45:56.681 --> 02:45:58.510
<v Speaker 1>the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand his old beans.</v>

3994
02:45:58.900 --> 02:45:59.733
<v Speaker 1>And then he literally sits there for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and does the slowest drip </v>

3995
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:04.990
<v Speaker 1>pour-over you've ever seen in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life.</v>

3996
02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:08.020

<v Speaker 3>I heard you're begin to bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brand bulletproof.</v>

4021
02:47:06.531 --> 02:47:07.041
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4022
02:47:07.041 --> 02:47:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that turned out to be kind of,</v>

4023
02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:14.450
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's name is a great name.</v>

4024
02:47:14.890 --> 02:47:18.680
<v Speaker 3>And Yell or Mark Formula,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was created by Robb Wolf.</v>

4025
02:47:18.681 --> 02:47:19.514
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

4026
02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:21.013
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rob Wolfe wrote about putting grass fed </v>

4027
02:47:23.961 --> 02:47:28.700
<v Speaker 3>butter and mct oil and coffee in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>2004 or something like that.</v>

4028
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote about and published it and well</v>

4029
02:47:31.461 --> 02:47:32.294
<v Speaker 3>that's that guy's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not all bad and some of them </v>

4030
02:47:35.931 --> 02:47:37.700
<v Speaker 3>aren't bad at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the pride,</v>

4031
02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:39.710
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Rhonda Patrick </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a correct does.</v>

4032
02:47:39.711 --> 02:47:40.544
<v Speaker 3>He gets things wrong about the science </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind things because he's sort of </v>

4033
02:47:42.351 --> 02:47:43.184
<v Speaker 3>reciting other people's work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not actually doing work and he's </v>

4034
02:47:45.861 --> 02:47:48.530
<v Speaker 3>not really a scientist when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

4035
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:53.090
<v Speaker 3>He's just a collector of ideas and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>redistributes them and puts that word on</v>

4036
02:47:53.091 --> 02:47:53.924
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine as long as you actually </v>

4037
02:47:55.491 --> 02:47:56.324
<v Speaker 3>hire a scientist like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>double and triple check everything </v>

4038
02:47:58.701 --> 02:48:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motors is a brilliant marketer.</v>

4039
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:03.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motivation was very deceptive </v>

4040
02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:07.033
<v Speaker 3>because is motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to sell everybody on this </v>

4041
02:48:08.391 --> 02:48:09.224
<v Speaker 3>idea of mycotoxins and coffee's coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>here to band is completely abandoned </v>

4042
02:48:12.741 --> 02:48:13.430
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4043
02:48:13.430 --> 02:48:16.130
<v Speaker 3>That was the one reason why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to buy his coffee as opposed to</v>

4044
02:48:16.131 --> 02:48:18.680
<v Speaker 3>anybody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely unsubstantiated.</v>

4045
02:48:18.681 --> 02:48:19.514
<v Speaker 3>And then we spend a shit load of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find out whether or not that </v>

4046
02:48:22.401 --> 02:48:25.400
<v Speaker 3>was true cause it's expensive to test </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee for mycotoxins.</v>

4047
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:27.810
<v Speaker 3>We tested all this different coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>random coffee,</v>

4048
02:48:27.811 --> 02:48:28.700
<v Speaker 3>you whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

4049
02:48:28.701 --> 02:48:29.511
<v Speaker 3>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

4050
02:48:29.511 --> 02:48:30.021
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bean,</v>

4051
02:48:30.021 --> 02:48:31.760
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

4052
02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:33.013
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the more I talked to actual </v>

4053
02:48:34.041 --> 02:48:35.990
<v Speaker 3>coffee experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they're like no,</v>

4054
02:48:35.991 --> 02:48:36.824
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to stop that in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>80s it's the difference between the </v>

4055
02:48:39.381 --> 02:48:42.230
<v Speaker 3>climate in Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an incredibly dry climate,</v>

4056
02:48:42.231 --> 02:48:43.820
<v Speaker 3>which is where all coffee comes from.</v>

4057
02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:45.710
<v Speaker 3>And this is another thing that we found </v>
<v Speaker 3>out from Peter Juliano.</v>

4058
02:48:46.310 --> 02:48:48.890
<v Speaker 3>All coffee came from Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

4059
02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:49.873
<v Speaker 3>And then they started growing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these other climates we can South </v>

4060
02:48:51.411 --> 02:48:52.244
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think of Colombia and Juan </v>

4061
02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Valdez and the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that coffee,</v>

4062
02:48:56.390 --> 02:48:59.150
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moist environment.</v>

4063
02:48:59.290 --> 02:49:01.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a moist green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lush environment,</v>

4064
02:49:01.381 --> 02:49:02.214
<v Speaker 3>not dry like Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would try to use this same </v>

4065
02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:08.670
<v Speaker 3>drawing methods and it didn't work cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's beans would get moldy and then they</v>

4066
02:49:08.671 --> 02:49:10.890
<v Speaker 3>would develop these molds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toxins.</v>

4067
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:11.783
<v Speaker 3>And so that became an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they figured out a way to wet </v>

4068
02:49:14.431 --> 02:49:15.264
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the wet processing became the </v>

4069
02:49:17.161 --> 02:49:19.640
<v Speaker 3>solution for dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4070
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:20.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mold issue.</v>

4071
02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:22.013
<v Speaker 3>They solve that a long fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some of the single origins that you </v>

4072
02:49:25.201 --> 02:49:27.630
<v Speaker 3>can buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the fancier places,</v>

4073
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:29.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are still dry process.</v>

4074
02:49:29.521 --> 02:49:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if those with eop coffees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4075
02:49:32.191 --> 02:49:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Ethan Coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopian coffees are still very,</v>

4076
02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:37.020
<v Speaker 3>very popular and really delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of,</v>

4077
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:40.620
<v Speaker 3>I think Juliano brought us in was your </v>
<v Speaker 3>guest chef.</v>

4078
02:49:40.650 --> 02:49:41.483
<v Speaker 3>How do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this stuff either Ethiopian </v>

4079
02:49:44.461 --> 02:49:45.210
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4080
02:49:45.210 --> 02:49:46.043

4081
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:48.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4082
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:50.070
<v Speaker 3>We're not gonna get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know which of the two of us,</v>

4083
02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>but it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost a sweet,</v>

4084
02:49:54.820 --> 02:49:56.430
<v Speaker 3>not sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lemony.</v>

4085
02:49:56.490 --> 02:49:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a,</v>

4086
02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

4091
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:07.890
<v Speaker 3>the variables and the variations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>flavors,</v>

4092
02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:08.724
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really interesting how some</v>
<v Speaker 3>flavors it just have like who is like </v>

4093

02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:27.660
<v Speaker 3>cause it's my friend's company and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4099
02:50:27.661 --> 02:50:32.430
<v Speaker 3>and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how ethical they are and how they</v>

4100
02:50:32.431 --> 02:50:33.264
<v Speaker 3>source it and how they have this great </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with this farm in Columbia </v>

02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:39.473
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's the easiest way to deal with </v>

4103

<v Speaker 3>it's just awesome.</v>

4107
02:50:46.530 --> 02:50:48.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just the cleanest way to go about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4108
02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:51.780
<v Speaker 3>And they also have this nitro,</v>
