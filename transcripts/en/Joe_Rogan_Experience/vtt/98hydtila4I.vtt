00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches on the weekends,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>if I'm off the road,</v>

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I go to coffee places to sit and write for hours and work on book manuscripts</v>

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and all by the small coffee like this one and three and a half hours later I'll</v>

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>leave and I just drop it in the trash because it's still about three quarters</v>

6
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:18.264
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>so I don't drink a lot of coffee in the wintertime.</v>

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink a cup of tea in the morning and have a cup,</v>

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>a part of a cup of coffee.</v>

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink all of the tea.</v>

11
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

12
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>what makes what?</v>

13
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>What fuels you to be so prolific?</v>

14
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You know you're saying you write an article a month for the La weekly was so</v>

15
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>once a week.</v>

16
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>A thousand words a week?</v>

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Which does not do that.</v>

19
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You write for rolling stone author Australia once a month and then I write,</v>

20
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I try and write a thousand words a day for myself and I have right now five</v>

21
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>different books in various states of completion and that's not some College Guy</v>

22
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Saying my manuscript,</v>

23
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

24
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>they're done and I'm by day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I edit,</v>

26
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm editing.</v>

27
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.400

28
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Travel Book and then at night I'm writing a,</v>

29
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>another journal book and working on one of two different music books.</v>

30
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I do a series of music books called fanatic where I,</v>

31
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>rare records and labels like music geek stuff and so I work on those at night.</v>

33
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And you also host a radio show and I have the weekly radio show I just filled</v>

34
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

35
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm filling in for iggy pop.</v>

38
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>He took a vacation from his show,</v>

39
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>so I filled in for him last week and this week as well.</v>

40
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>So I did those shows.</v>

41
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.431
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>

42
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:31.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm always busy and so stimulants would get in my way.</v>

43
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>What powers me.</v>

44
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not money,</v>

45
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not ambition,</v>

46
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.313
<v Speaker 1>it's anger.</v>

47
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those people.</v>

48
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

49
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I wish there was a better way to say it,</v>

50
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

51
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>it's vengeance.</v>

52
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>He laughed at me in high school,</v>

53
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

54
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>He said I was going to be anything really like watch this,</v>

55
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.191
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

56
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Still pushing you in 56.</v>

57
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it.</v>

58
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.780

87
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

88
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.091
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

89
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I set up adversarial relationships.</v>

90
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against you or anything.</v>

91
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like I have to have something to push against.</v>

92
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Like a schedule that is like the schedules,</v>

93
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>like Godzilla.</v>

94
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't finish this all like really man,</v>

95
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to serve you up and eat you every day like a steak and I just have to</v>

96
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:46.111
<v Speaker 1>have that.</v>

97
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm getting back and it's A.</v>

98
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the people I was in bands with,</v>

99
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I have to crush them.</v>

100
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone grew up with,</v>

101
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I have to powderize them.</v>

102
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Why that's such a weird motivation is it sucks immature.</v>

103
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's 11 year old sandbox.</v>

104
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.103
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

105
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you're aware of it,</v>

106
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>which makes it even stranger because it's not something that you're just</v>

107
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>operating under know it's controlling you and you don't understand why I quite</v>

108
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.784
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

109
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.281
<v Speaker 1>Like if I,</v>

111
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

113
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an actor but I go for acting parts on bike basically going in there and</v>

114
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>winging it and I get,</v>

115
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I get to go up for like really big parse this a little bit of trepidation</v>

117
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>knowing I'm going in there.</v>

118
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>But then I think like,</v>

119
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.873
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

120
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.163

122
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Line it up and almost like run out of my car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like you know where you at Man?</v>

125
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.280

126
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tough guy because I'm not.</v>

127
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I just need,</v>

128
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>it just needs to be trying to tell me I can't and I that informs</v>

129
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>everything I do.</v>

130
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Like instead of just dialing my radio show in,</v>

131
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I will work on that sucker for like five hours.</v>

132
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It has to be all handpicked.</v>

133
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:53.501
<v Speaker 1>Know that song,</v>

136
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and they make like three drafts of it.</v>

137
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.124
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>

138
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I live alone.</v>

139
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like I work all the time like,</v>

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you vacation ever where you just chill?</v>

147
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't intellectually and existentially.</v>

148
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand the idea of a vacation.</v>

149
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I make a joke on stage and said I want to come back 10 pounds lighter with an</v>

150
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>internal parasite.</v>

151
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.571
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

152
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I want to come back with a scar where the spear kind of grazed me and eight</v>

153
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>grade stories and a dangerous insect in my bag.</v>

154
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit on the beach and soak in the race.</v>

155
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to get sunburned by being in the desert and you know,</v>

156
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how the sun won't try and kill me by noon.</v>

157
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the Sahara.</v>

158
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how I go about it.</v>

159
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So part of your motivation is actually the perception by other people,</v>

160
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.773
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

161
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Like understanding that what you're doing is so undeniable,</v>

162
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>the volume that you're putting out and the intensity,</v>

163
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.341
<v Speaker 1>the intensity,</v>

164
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>so undeniable.</v>

165
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll show you motherfuckers.</v>

166
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

168
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.451
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

169
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

170
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Even with people who like me,</v>

171
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.701
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

172
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:04.511
<v Speaker 1>Yay Henry's here.</v>

173
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:04.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

174
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:04.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

175
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

176
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.861
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>

177
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Pitch.</v>

178
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>So here's a place you won't go.</v>

179
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And not that I have any aggression towards these people.</v>

180
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:13.744
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

181
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I just want to burn brightly and it's not about money.</v>

182
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not about I'm better than you because I don't think I'm better than</v>

183
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.354
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

184
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I just want to explode as much as possible.</v>

185
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think to my audience,</v>

186
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's to their benefit.</v>

187
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.381
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

188
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that dude's gonna go out there to a place I don't want to go and he's going to</v>

189
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>come back with 10 grade photos and a story about how we nearly lost his foot.</v>

190
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.663
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

191
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And like put me in coach.</v>

192
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the game I want to play.</v>

193
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I go for.</v>
