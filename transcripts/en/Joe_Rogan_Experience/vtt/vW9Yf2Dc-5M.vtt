<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just something has hit the Internet </v>

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>that I need to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it may or may not be legit,</v>

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but I decided to retire young thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheese catches later.</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trolling you think so.</v>

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people have been </v>

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>hitting me up telling me to show you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what's going on.</v>

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I decided to retire young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means like 34 eventually.</v>

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.323
<v Speaker 2>Listen man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless he got fucking head kick today </v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.303
<v Speaker 2>and knocked into oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that he's going to go out on a </v>

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>loss like that to nate Diaz Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got plenty of cash.</v>

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 2>If he wanted to retire young and step </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.693
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably made somewhere in the </v>

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 5 million bucks of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aldo fight.</v>

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 2>He probably made more than that for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz fight.</v>

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.253
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine after he spent a fuck </v>

16
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:57.564
<v Speaker 2>load of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably still got a few million </v>

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 2>bucks laying around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a hero in Ireland.</v>

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 2>He could always make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can always run a gym and be fine,</v>

19
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 2>but if I had a gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.023
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why it would make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why it would make sense </v>

21
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 2>as connor had actually thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>retiring from mma before he got the call</v>

22
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:17.244
<v Speaker 2>for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a point in time where he had </v>

23
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:20.814
<v Speaker 2>some friends that were experiencing some</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious health issues from fighting and </v>

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.913
<v Speaker 2>then most recently that young man from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Portuguese guy died in an mma </v>

25
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>contest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think took place in the UK.</v>

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
<v Speaker 1>What wasn't he involved or related in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way to one of those guys that just </v>

27
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>died too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he know him?</v>

28
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Are trained with him?</v>

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he trained with the Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that just died recently.</v>

30
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>It is entirely possible in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I had to guess,</v>

31
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>there's no way he'd do it like this.</v>
