00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience I do believe has a lot of benefits to it and I started</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>because I had major injuries and I didn't want to actually take the pain pills I</v>

3
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>was being prescribed for my surgeries,</v>

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I started investigating weed and marijuana and I would help that</v>

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>to calm me down.</v>

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I want her to talk to you about that because that's another issue that I think</v>

7
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 2>is really important because I keep hearing about fighters that are having</v>

8
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 2>problems with pain pills.</v>

9
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I think a hundred percent people are going to be back to back.</v>

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Major fucking surgeries lined up under my Brooklyn job or client ankle.</v>

11
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:28.124
<v Speaker 1>Tore up my knee.</v>

12
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I had my neck surgery.</v>

13
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I had like a couple of good ones will my hand a couple of times.</v>

14
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>So I've had multiple surgeries so one of the things they started getting major</v>

15
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>injuries and then getting surgeries and I didn't want to take the pain pills.</v>

16
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Although I did take some of them and I like when I broke my jaw I was taking a</v>

17
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>liquid,</v>

18
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>some kind of liquid pain pill.</v>

19
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

20
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but that's what started my venture into wheat,</v>

21
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>so it was just to get through the night so I could sleep,</v>

22
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but it does fuck in my memory man,</v>

23
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>like I was having like the next day I have an issue like holding combinations</v>

24
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>for these guys and stuff and just not remembering dates and stuff.</v>

25
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>So it did fuck with me personally.</v>

26
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I call it my memory and I don't think it's for everybody because I'm very,</v>

27
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>very high strong and try to get shit done all not trying to get shit done on it</v>

28
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

29
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think if somebody else has already killed predisposed to be a slight bit</v>

30
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>lazy,</v>

31
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>this is not for you 100 percent either way.</v>

32
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not for everyone makes him differently though.</v>

33
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>He can enjoy time.</v>

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

36
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a reverse effect.</v>

38
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Like most people get stolen the sit on the couch,</v>

39
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they'll get hungry and not want to go start doing combos and shit.</v>

40
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.943
<v Speaker 1>This guy's shadow.</v>

41
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

42
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.291
<v Speaker 2>know what?</v>

43
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I figured things out about my body when I'm high,</v>

44
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

46
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.160

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.650

<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>

62
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 2>There was a dude in China that got arrested.</v>

63
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.831
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

145
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 2>She probably wrote a check.</v>

146
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.081
<v Speaker 2>I can improve it.</v>

147
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 2>How can they prove that he didn't get the ghost out?</v>

148
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.153
<v Speaker 2>Smell it.</v>

149
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.413
<v Speaker 2>ECTOPLASM.</v>

150
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.133
<v Speaker 2>Smell it.</v>

151
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.873
<v Speaker 2>Smell.</v>

152
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 2>If it smells like it can be rigged game though.</v>

153
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:58.020
<v Speaker 2>She waits right to you.</v>

154
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Starting.</v>

155
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>She farts are in your face.</v>

156
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.493
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

157
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking crazy world out there though.</v>

158
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 2>You can talk people into anything.</v>

159
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.751
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget.</v>

160
00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

161
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I found out about Nirvana.</v>

162
00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I was out where this dude's house that I used to buy stolen radios from.</v>

163
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.260
<v Speaker 2>There's this one dude.</v>

164
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.110
<v Speaker 2>If you needed a radio back then when I didn't understand Karma,</v>

165
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you know you need to radio from your car.</v>

166
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.610
<v Speaker 2>You can get one from this kid who always had radios.</v>

167
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Then he would just somehow or another get and you didn't ask any questions,</v>

168
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:24.020
<v Speaker 2>but you knew they were stolen.</v>

169
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Were over his house and he was into music.</v>

170
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 2>This kid,</v>

171
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it was just a bad kid,</v>

172
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

174
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Bad suburban kid.</v>

175
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.933
<v Speaker 2>Not too bad.</v>

176
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.350
<v Speaker 2>We went over his house and he goes,</v>

177
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 2>this is going to change me music.</v>

178
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.721
<v Speaker 2>And so what is it?</v>

179
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:35.901
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

180
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it's called fucking Nirvana.</v>

181
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And he starts playing it and he goes,</v>

182
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.640
<v Speaker 2>all those hairbands,</v>

183
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.780
<v Speaker 2>those guys are fucked.</v>

184
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.340
<v Speaker 2>And he played this shit.</v>

185
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:43.731
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

186
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:44.121
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

187
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Like you just nailed it.</v>

188
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Like this kid nailed it in his,</v>

189
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.430
<v Speaker 2>in his bedroom in Newton,</v>

190
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

191
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Like right when the nevermind came out.</v>

192
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.603
<v Speaker 2>This kid nailed it.</v>

193
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>He just was an emphasis of thief.</v>

194
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.181
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

195
00:05:59.181 --> 00:05:59.590
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

196
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.600
<v Speaker 2>this is going to change.</v>

197
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>This goes,</v>

198
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>guys are fucked.</v>

199
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It was that obvious though was stat obvious.</v>

200
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Danny boy played it for me first and we were both like,</v>

201
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

202
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 2>they draws drunk.</v>

203
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>There's only been a few times.</v>

204
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And like musical history when someone hits some new levels of something we had</v>

205
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 2>never seen it before.</v>

206
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>And when Nirvana came out that was like,</v>

207
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

208
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

209
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Undeniable talent is undeniable uniqueness.</v>

210
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.570
<v Speaker 2>The power of their songs.</v>

211
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.311
<v Speaker 2>Song after song.</v>

212
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

213
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Honest though.</v>

214
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

216
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:27.944
<v Speaker 2>totally honest.</v>

217
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Raw.</v>

218
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 2>And like at this insane heroin way.</v>

219
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Insane heroin.</v>

220
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Honesty spawned by the punk movement.</v>

221
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that what is some chains chains?</v>

222
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

223
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.383
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

224
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 2>they were more on the metal side to me.</v>

225
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>But like they were definitely of that grunge metal movement,</v>

226
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>like soundgarden rocked out a little harder.</v>

227
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 2>You know that song,</v>

228
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 2>them bones,</v>

229
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ that makes you feel like you're dying when you're listening to it</v>

230
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.133
<v Speaker 2>shows a beach.</v>

231
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 2>There was a dude who is sad.</v>

232
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 2>He that motherfucker understood that he was dying.</v>

233
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 2>When he wrote that song,</v>

234
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>he understood that he was on that path when he wrote that song.</v>

235
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think lane rope tows.</v>

236
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.993
<v Speaker 2>He just sang it.</v>

237
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I think Jerry Cantrell wrote all that stuff.</v>

238
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.533
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

239
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure whatever.</v>

240
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 2>There may be a few that I'm wrong on,</v>

241
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>but at the bulk and the tempera form that what I'm saying is like the way layne</v>

242
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 2>staley hit notes like it made you like,</v>

243
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 2>it made you feel that you were dying.</v>

244
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that song going to end up a big old pile.</v>

245
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Them bones like that screaming was like Jesus Christ.</v>

246
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I saw a man in the box,</v>

247
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:34.821
<v Speaker 2>like on MTV.</v>

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.211
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

249
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:36.044

252
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.113
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

253
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of.</v>

254
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I had a night with that dude and another guy,</v>

255
