3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Joe,</v>

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.403
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 2>170 fucking episodes and I'm still keeping my laptop power on.</v>

7
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.343
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

8
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

9
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.990

13
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you will get 15% off the number one sex toys for men.</v>

14
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 2>It was a tight race between number one and number two.</v>

15
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.511
<v Speaker 1>What was the other one?</v>

16
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:29.344
<v Speaker 1>Ham.</v>

17
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Melons.</v>

18
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>We sliced ham.</v>

19
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>

20
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 2>do it or don't do it.</v>

21
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 2>They're just a sponsor folks.</v>

22
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 2>But it's a good product if you're into masturbating,</v>

23
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to do it,</v>

24
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 2>and you probably are,</v>

25
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 2>this is better than just doing it.</v>

26
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 2>It's technology.</v>

27
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Embrace the times.</v>

29
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>We were also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh and it makers of Alpha</v>

30
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:48.801
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

31
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 2>and we have a new alpha brain that's coming out.</v>

32
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 2>It's called Alpha brain source for all you folks in the UK that have much more</v>

33
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 2>restrictive laws when it comes to nutritional supplements.</v>

34
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Like they can't even get vitamin B six over there and some in some places in</v>

35
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

36
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

37
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.273
<v Speaker 2>The strange rent.</v>

38
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 2>So our Alpha brain was considered a drug,</v>

40
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>so it takes it out.</v>

41
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Does it put anything else in?</v>

42
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

43
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.773
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just different.</v>

44
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 2>The alternative ingredients that have a similar effects and so we're still</v>

45
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 2>fucking with it right now.</v>

46
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.523
<v Speaker 2>Hipster ingredients.</v>

47
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.031
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

48
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 2>it might be better for some people that find the original Alpha brain is hard to</v>

50
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:19.081
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

51
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Like some people get nauseous from it and some people doesn't make them feel</v>

52
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:22.741
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

53
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:22.951
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

54
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

55
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 2>it's real weird.</v>

56
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a different,</v>

57
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a different biological setup,</v>

58
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I was a little sensitive to it.</v>

60
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>But I took a lot that was the issue take too much.</v>

62
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And I took two in the morning,</v>

63
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>two at night and I think that was too much.</v>

64
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Three once in one dose,</v>

65
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>three or four in one dose or forgotten.</v>

66
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And I did not feel good.</v>

67
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.971
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

68
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is what people feel like all the time.</v>

69
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got a different tolerance for caffeine,</v>

70
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:46.891
<v Speaker 1>for anything.</v>

71
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>But for me too is good.</v>

72
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I take two Alpha brains and it's uh,</v>

73
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.683
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

74
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not that shit from that movie.</v>

75
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>What is it with Bradley Cooper?</v>

76
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just vitamins that enhance cognitive function.</v>

77
00:01:58.781 --> 00:01:59.161
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

78
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it is enhance.</v>

79
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Just like vitamins enhance your health.</v>

80
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's very subtle but effective.</v>

81
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

82
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And the most important thing about any of the Onnit products is there's a</v>

83
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent money back guarantee.</v>

84
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to return the product.</v>

85
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Just say it didn't work for you and you get all your money back.</v>

86
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>And we tried to make this thing as fair as possible.</v>

87
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>If you think it's too expensive,</v>

88
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I urge you please,</v>

89

<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in nootropics to go online,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Google the subject,</v>

91
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>look into it.</v>

92
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interesting studies behind it and I personally have been</v>

93
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>studying them and experimenting with it for a long time now and I like it.</v>

94
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I liked the effects and if you think that that on it,</v>

95
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain is too expensive,</v>

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>go to the website and steal the ingredient list.</v>

100
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

101
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I am way more concerned with people not feeling ripped off than I am up for</v>

102
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:51.834
<v Speaker 1>making money.</v>

103
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why we make it as easy as possible.</v>

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>so enjoy it or don't enjoy it,</v>

107
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of cool products that we have out</v>

108
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

109
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 2>One of them is called shroom tech sport and it's excellent for anybody who's</v>

112
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>if you do anything that's like super strenuous,</v>

113
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:09.844
<v Speaker 2>you know you're,</v>

114
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>you know you're doing running or like some serious weightlifting class or</v>

115
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:14.711
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

116
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Anything you do will you really exert yourself.</v>

117
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing supplement.</v>

118
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It's great for Jujitsu.</v>

119
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I love it for,</v>

120
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>for any kind of athletic stuff,</v>

121
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but if you're not in the work in Alec,</v>

122
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Bryan doesn't even take that shit.</v>

123
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:24.821
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't help.</v>

124
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yo-Yoing does this doesn't help us.</v>

125
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.433
<v Speaker 2>Yoyo Games.</v>

126
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>We also have a shroom tech.</v>

127
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>What would the shrimp tech is based on all the information that's at [inaudible]</v>

128
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>dot com [inaudible] dot com but it's based on the quarter steps mushroom,</v>

129
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>which is a mushroom that actually enhances your body's ability to process oxygen</v>

130
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.034
<v Speaker 2>and people like,</v>

131
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>and a higher climates and animals in higher climates eat it and they actually</v>

132
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.271
<v Speaker 2>get energy and they,</v>

133
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>that's how they figured out that this stuff works.</v>

134
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

135
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>we also have a shroom tech immune,</v>

136
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:51.021
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

137
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 2>an immune supplement.</v>

138
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 2>And basically the way this one works,</v>

139
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 2>what as it's been explained to me is your body doesn't understand what this</v>

140
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>mushroom is when it thinks it may be like a bug thinks you may be sick,</v>

141
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>so your body's immune system fires up for a fight that never comes.</v>

142
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

143
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 2>And so then your immune system is just like on full tilt,</v>

144
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145

233
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.281
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

234
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:25.600
<v Speaker 1>before we even started this interview,</v>

235
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you that I'm ready to join your cult.</v>

236
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I've gone online,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

238
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I've seen other cult members and leaders before.</v>

239
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>They're not nearly as charismatic as you.</v>

240
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't make as much sense as you,</v>

241
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I think you're on point and I'm ready to sign up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You just tell me what I need to.</v>

243
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.890

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:46.271
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

249
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>it's dead on Peter Joseph.</v>

250
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't know is the creative,</v>

251
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like I used the,</v>

252
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.550

253
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:55.031
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

254
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you refer to it as a movement and that's not cocky in any way,</v>

256
00:06:58.601 --> 00:06:59.351
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

257
00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>That's just what it is.</v>

258
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.571
<v Speaker 1>It's a movement,</v>

259
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:02.110

266
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

267
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

268
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating thing that's going on right now.</v>

269
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And your movies and your movement,</v>

270
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

271
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>can you say it's yours now?</v>

272
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Now it's sort of like it's become a life of its own right?</v>

273
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.291
<v Speaker 5>No owns it.</v>

274
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:21.670
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

275
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 5>and whether people like it or not,</v>

276
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 5>they're a part of the zeitgeists movement one way or another.</v>

277
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 5>What does the zeitgeists movement?</v>

278
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 5>It's the definition of the times.</v>

279
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.480
<v Speaker 5>It's the cultural nuance of Ivy.</v>

280
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 5>This is all the shit that we believe and think it's true and how we progress</v>

281
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:35.301
<v Speaker 5>through time.</v>

282
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Hence the Zike guys movement.</v>

283
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.723
<v Speaker 5>So whether we,</v>

284
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 5>anyone likes it or not,</v>

285
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.990
<v Speaker 5>they're part of the Zeitgeists boob.</v>

286
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 5>So I just brought that into that particular context.</v>

287
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>How did you become this smooth talk bad motherfucker?</v>

288
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>How did this happen?</v>

289
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>How did you become this guy?</v>

290
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not just that you have all these great ideas.</v>

291
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.701
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

292
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you never use the word awesome.</v>

293
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.071
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

294
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>You just sail through the sentences and you're just like your musician.</v>

295
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that what your background is?</v>

296
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 5>I am a musician with percussionists,</v>

297
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 5>classical percussionists.</v>

298
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 5>That's what I tried to do for years and years,</v>

299
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 5>but didn't fit in the whole orchestral establishment percussion scene.</v>

300
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.551
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

301
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Brett percussion in enlightened me exists.</v>

302
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not just,</v>

303
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not drunk.</v>

304
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.391
<v Speaker 5>It's drums.</v>

305
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 5>You have the mallet family,</v>

306
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 5>then there's the kettle drums like Timpani.</v>

307
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 5>Then you have hand portion and learn the mall as much as I could.</v>

308
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 5>Given the time that I have in my studio in Culver City,</v>

309
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I have full section of my little house blocked off or whenever I can pursue my</v>

310
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 5>old hobby again,</v>

311
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 5>which seems to be less and less.</v>

312
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:32.504
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately.</v>

313
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.181
<v Speaker 5>People listen to me.</v>

314
00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Some of your stuff online,</v>

315
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 5>so I'm,</v>

316
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm working on compiling.</v>

317
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 5>I've been hesitant to do that because my identity has been so bizarre as a</v>

318
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 5>filmmaker,</v>

319
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 5>which I'd never intended to be.</v>

320
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:42.021
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

321
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 5>I think I sent you the link of the first Zike guys performance a performance.</v>

322
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't intended to be a documentary in the sense formulaically as you would</v>

323
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.661
<v Speaker 5>traditionally assumed,</v>

324
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 5>which is how did it morph?</v>

325
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:53.144
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

326
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.301
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

327
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 5>I had the 2007 I did a six night run in lower Manhattan free,</v>

328
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 5>who was a thing.</v>

329
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 5>I spent a lot of money on prepared this piece over the course of seven months.</v>

330
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Didn't expect it to go anywhere because basically I had no rights to actually</v>

331
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 5>pursue this as a film.</v>

332
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 5>So this is a firm firmly one shot off,</v>

333
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 5>fair use type of deal.</v>

334
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 5>So I did it,</v>

335
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:15.601
<v Speaker 5>publicized it,</v>

336
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.434
<v Speaker 5>people came,</v>

337
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 5>everything was cool,</v>

338
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.911
<v Speaker 5>everyone liked it.</v>

339
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 5>It was very dramatic.</v>

340
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 5>He has some people walked out and people really liked it.</v>

341
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Some inspired Q.</v>

342
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:21.841
<v Speaker 5>And.</v>

343
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

344
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 5>It was a catharsis for me.</v>

345
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 5>I was in advertising,</v>

346
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 5>I was doing shit that I didn't appreciate doing is what the system does,</v>

347
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:28.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

348
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 5>it forces you into a particular pocket for the most of us for a lot of,</v>

349
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 5>we don't necessarily enjoy what we're doing.</v>

350
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 5>So this is a catharsis.</v>

351
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 5>And the unique thing about it is it was so honest.</v>

352
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 5>This is a very honest work from me.</v>

353
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really think about approaching a demographic.</v>

354
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.110
<v Speaker 5>And when I,</v>

355
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 5>when it went online on Google video before youtube,</v>

356
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 5>this is when Google video was the only Internet video site that actually had</v>

357
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:48.940
<v Speaker 5>full length stuff.</v>

358
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 5>And very rarely you'd hear about feature length films getting there.</v>

359
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 5>And I just happened to hit that paradigm right then and it went crazy viral and</v>

360
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 5>the lawsuits were threatened and everyone thought it was some big documentary,</v>

361
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:01.141
<v Speaker 5>big production.</v>

362
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 5>They had no idea that background of lawsuits or threaten the people that are in</v>

363
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

364
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:04.801
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

365
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 5>that film was a fair use film.</v>

366
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 5>It was not intended to be released.</v>

367
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 5>So whenever people saw like 20,</v>

368
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 5>30 million views in the first year of when seeing dollar signs as though,</v>

369
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 5>and I wasn't even selling anything,</v>

370
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't intending to.</v>

371
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.580
<v Speaker 5>And then eventually I went back,</v>

372
00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:18.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

373
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 5>the tail between my legs with all these people that,</v>

374
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 5>cause the whole thing is full.</v>

375
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.200
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is a montage of the zeitgeists.</v>

376
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 5>It's just one big cluster of all sorts of different personalities kind of mushed</v>

377
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.254
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

378
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 5>And most of them supported it.</v>

379
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 5>And then some of them got a little greedy but everyone got paid off for the most</v>

380
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:34.681
<v Speaker 5>part.</v>

381
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 5>And there's still a few rocks left unturned,</v>

382
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 5>but the statute of limitations is now up on that.</v>

383
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 5>So if anyone wants to sue me,</v>

384
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.110
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have the greater,</v>

385
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

386
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 5>effect the ass.</v>

387
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.521
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

388
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 5>Well it isn't all just stuff that is out there in the public record.</v>

389
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Essentially.</v>

390
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.391
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

391
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:49.224
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

392
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.080
<v Speaker 5>and put it together.</v>

393
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can sue anybody for anything if they think they can get money out of it.</v>

394
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 5>Especially in the film and the film and media industry.</v>

395
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 5>So you obviously you surprised by the response to the first film you,</v>

396
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.760
<v Speaker 5>you had no idea any of this was going to happen.</v>

397
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 5>I had no intention to make a second film.</v>

398
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I never considered myself a filmmaker.</v>

399
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 5>It was always musically driven and then a denim came out in 2008 and that was,</v>

400
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 5>that was picked up by the art of his film festivals shown here at the Egyptian</v>

401
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:14.941
<v Speaker 5>theater.</v>

402
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 5>That had a huge response.</v>

403
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 5>Even larger in a certain sense because it was the first time it had been</v>

404
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 5>publicly displayed,</v>

405
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 5>this whole phenomenon and then that carried over into the zeitgeists movement,</v>

406
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:25.030
<v Speaker 5>which was basically the,</v>

407
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 5>the thought experiment I had is like,</v>

408
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:26.941
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

409
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:27.751
<v Speaker 5>we have these film series.</v>

410
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 5>He had plenty of people like Michael Moore and making films.</v>

411
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Do they really support change or are they really doing anything to actually</v>

412
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 5>initiate a community effort to get something going?</v>

413
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 5>And at that point in time,</v>

414
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea what that would actually be.</v>

415
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.311
<v Speaker 5>It was I did,</v>

416
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:40.540
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

417
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.071
<v Speaker 5>I figured,</v>

418
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Speaker 5>well it says in the movie on if he remembers,</v>

419
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.381
<v Speaker 5>I coasted end up,</v>

420
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 5>it says join the movement,</v>

421
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 5>start the largest critical mass the world's ever seen to try and get some change</v>

422
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 5>going and it seemed to take root.</v>

423
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 5>And then from there it's been this kind of bubbling,</v>

424
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 5>changing and morphine kind of phenomenon that's global.</v>

425
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Now the zeitgeists movement,</v>

426
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:58.534
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

427
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 5>which is a shared community.</v>

428
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 5>I want to make people understand it isn't like a movement than any the world's</v>

429
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:03.631
<v Speaker 5>ever seen.</v>

430
00:12:03.631 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 5>This is just the people that the group of people would have a similar value set.</v>

431
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way I describe it.</v>

432
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.800
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate anti institution.</v>

433
00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:11.570
<v Speaker 5>So I often don't even reference the movement.</v>

434
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 5>I referenced the ideas behind it.</v>

435
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So you make this documentary,</v>

436
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it gets out and then all the sudden you realize that there's this crazy movement</v>

437
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.111
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>

438
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>And how do you attempt to organize it?</v>

439
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:23.610
<v Speaker 2>How do you attempt,</v>

440
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 2>do you not do just get out of its way and let it organize itself?</v>

441
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of an occupy Wall Street types of it.</v>

442
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.510
<v Speaker 5>Combination of the two.</v>

443
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.870
<v Speaker 5>We started off at a self organizing capacity but volunteers from around the</v>

444
00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:33.500
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

445
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.190
<v Speaker 5>it was beautiful actually just getting all this communication from different</v>

446
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:37.851
<v Speaker 5>demographics.</v>

447
00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:38.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean the whole is like our spectrum.</v>

448
00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:39.890
<v Speaker 5>The audience if you will,</v>

449
00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:42.380
<v Speaker 5>for not just the fillings with for the movement that it paid attention to these</v>

450
00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 5>ideas is totally vast.</v>

451
00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:44.744
<v Speaker 5>Yet people that are,</v>

452
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.140
<v Speaker 5>I've met kids that are like 10 years old with a little zeitgeists move a tee</v>

453
00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:50.840
<v Speaker 5>shirt on up to 80 year old men that you know,</v>

454
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.970
<v Speaker 5>they're looking for something different so it's amazing.</v>

455
00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:54.590
<v Speaker 5>And the ethnicity differences are massive.</v>

456
00:12:54.591 --> 00:12:56.510
<v Speaker 5>Want to be in Israel next month giving a lecture.</v>

457
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.130
<v Speaker 5>It's truly unique.</v>

458
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.630
<v Speaker 5>So it self organized.</v>

459
00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:02.540
<v Speaker 5>As it began we started to pinpoint different coordination positions.</v>

460
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:03.374
<v Speaker 5>People in charge</v>

461
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.460
<v Speaker 2>places and give lectures as well.</v>

462
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

463
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.840
<v Speaker 2>And what is like,</v>

464
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.320
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

465
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 2>the lecture essentially,</v>

466
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:08.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

467
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.890
<v Speaker 2>is it just you breaking down how this got started or is it you talk about yeah,</v>

468
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.830
<v Speaker 5>your perspective while they usually it's lectures broken into three released now</v>

469
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.120
<v Speaker 5>lecture,</v>

470
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.990
<v Speaker 5>spoken to three typical lectures broken into the first part being what defines</v>

471
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:23.220
<v Speaker 5>awareness and logic.</v>

472
00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:24.990
<v Speaker 5>And reason how we think about information.</v>

473
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 5>We're dismissing the Messenger.</v>

474
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.840
<v Speaker 5>Gotta look at it logically.</v>

475
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:28.091
<v Speaker 5>X,</v>

476
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:28.251
<v Speaker 5>Y,</v>

477
00:13:28.251 --> 00:13:28.801
<v Speaker 5>and Z's.</v>

478
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Forget,</v>

479
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.630
<v Speaker 5>forget the subjects.</v>

480
00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:33.900
<v Speaker 5>It's all about the train of thought that the process of thought is,</v>

481
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 5>is irrespective of personality.</v>

482
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 5>There's a huge conflict in society between logic and psychology and they're</v>

483
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:39.961
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

484
00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:42.210
<v Speaker 5>very different and I can expand on that as we go.</v>

485
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.330
<v Speaker 5>Second Section is the criticism of the current socioeconomic platform,</v>

486
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.700
<v Speaker 5>which I consider to be one massive corruption.</v>

487
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.840
<v Speaker 5>We talk about corruption.</v>

488
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:49.890
<v Speaker 5>You'll a hard drive corrupts.</v>

489
00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:51.390
<v Speaker 5>It's messed up or criminal,</v>

490
00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:52.650
<v Speaker 5>political and Rob's a convenience store.</v>

491
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 5>It's a corruption of the system,</v>

492
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 5>the socioeconomic system,</v>

493
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.044
<v Speaker 5>the legal system.</v>

494
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:56.671
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>

495
00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:58.440
<v Speaker 5>the entire socioeconomic system,</v>

496
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 5>namely economic,</v>

497
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.830
<v Speaker 5>not only politics,</v>

498
00:14:01.831 --> 00:14:03.060
<v Speaker 5>politics is an outgrowth,</v>

499
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.290
<v Speaker 5>but I won't jump on that.</v>

500
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.290
<v Speaker 5>One is a is one massive corruption of what it means to live on this planet,</v>

501
00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:12.180
<v Speaker 5>what it means to perfect good public health.</v>

502
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.030
<v Speaker 5>So there's that section he had stay in Ed.</v>

503
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.730
<v Speaker 5>That's massive and it must the criticisms and presentations I do.</v>

504
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.550
<v Speaker 5>Then there's the solution which support the train of thought,</v>

505
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 5>which has many different names as far as a new social system,</v>

506
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.960
<v Speaker 5>which I don't even really address any more.</v>

507
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.730
<v Speaker 5>I'd just like to go for the train of thought.</v>

508
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.100
<v Speaker 5>And what it comes down to is you have to have a system,</v>

509
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.680
<v Speaker 5>a system that's based on planetary resource management,</v>

510
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.880
<v Speaker 5>very fundamental stuff.</v>

511
00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:33.510
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

512
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.390
<v Speaker 5>a system that's not based on growth and all the strange,</v>

513
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:37.440
<v Speaker 5>infinite growth paradigm stuff.</v>

514
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure my resource manager,</v>

515
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 2>whole community,</v>

516
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>one giant community gets together and says,</v>

517
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.161
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

518
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:44.430
<v Speaker 2>what do we need and how do we keep everybody happy</v>

519
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.590
<v Speaker 5>globally,</v>

520
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.130
<v Speaker 5>globally?</v>

521
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.890
<v Speaker 5>And you think about it in the broadest symbiotic sense.</v>

522
00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:49.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

523
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 5>like one of the great psychological revelations,</v>

524
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 5>intellectual revelations that we've had as species is that is that we've been</v>

525
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 5>living in these divisive kind of tribalistic concepts and we assume normality</v>

526
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 5>with it because of how long they persisted.</v>

527
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 5>But we tend to find that what we find now as far as information is concerned,</v>

528
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 5>is that we live in a global system.</v>

529
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 5>We live in a symbiosis.</v>

530
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 5>There's stretches outward,</v>

531
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 5>honest to infinity.</v>

532
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:14.051
<v Speaker 5>So the very idea of separation because literally tangibly on applicable to the</v>

533
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 5>way we approach our life,</v>

534
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 5>where we approached knowledge,</v>

535
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 5>the way we approach approach society,</v>

536
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 5>the way we approach economics,</v>

537
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 5>which is the defining feature of our existence.</v>

538
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:23.661
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

539
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 5>how we get what we need,</v>

540
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 5>how we relate,</v>

541
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

542
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 5>how it,</v>

543
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 5>the renewable elements,</v>

544
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 5>the regeneration,</v>

545
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:29.331
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

546
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 5>the Omni regeneration or as a Buckminster fuller of everything.</v>

547
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 5>How do we respect that?</v>

548
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 5>And the ultimate realization is that we have to begin to unify all concepts.</v>

549
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 5>You see this and intellectual things.</v>

550
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 5>Consilience is a book by Edward O.</v>

551
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 5>Wilson.</v>

552
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 5>Early on in the 1980s he wrote about this concept of all the the disciplines</v>

553
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 5>starting to merge together.</v>

554
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 5>So you can't talk about chemistry without talking about biology or other way</v>

555
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:53.241
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

556
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 5>You can't talk about physics that are talking about mathematics.</v>

557
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 5>You can't separate anything anymore.</v>

558
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.090
<v Speaker 5>And that's a unique phenomenon that's occurring and you can stretch that train</v>

559
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 5>of thought backwards and forwards in my approach as far as simplicity,</v>

560
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 5>the economic system has to be unified.</v>

561
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 5>It has to have a very simple respect of what actually supports us.</v>

562
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I can ramble that.</v>

563
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>How did that transition take place?</v>

564
00:16:14.371 --> 00:16:14.561
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>

565
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:19.000
<v Speaker 2>even if you were to engineer the perfect Utopian mathematic formula for keeping</v>

566
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:20.320
<v Speaker 2>everybody no such thing,</v>

567
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:21.910
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with the money that you have now?</v>

568
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Does it just dissolved?</v>

569
00:16:23.231 --> 00:16:24.250
<v Speaker 2>We start from scratch,</v>

570
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

571
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:24.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:25.271
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>

573
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:26.470
<v Speaker 2>How does it transition from,</v>

574
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.470
<v Speaker 2>from one monetary system that makes no sense.</v>

575
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Where there's massive amounts of corruption and people with huge amounts of</v>

576
00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:34.330
<v Speaker 2>resources that they've probably gotten by.</v>

577
00:16:34.331 --> 00:16:36.070
<v Speaker 2>What would be considered immoral,</v>

578
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Speaker 2>although legal ways.</v>

579
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.793
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

580
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with their money?</v>

581
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

582
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:42.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a few few answers to that one.</v>

583
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

584
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of the word that Utopian though.</v>

585
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

586
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that in a sense of a fantasy that's impossible of being achieved.</v>

587
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

588
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it is an ideal like a boulder,</v>

589
00:16:52.391 --> 00:16:53.021
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

590
00:16:53.021 --> 00:16:54.730
<v Speaker 2>As far as what friend of mine said to me once,</v>

591
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a working utopia and I believe it is,</v>

592
00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:57.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

593
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean it in a sense of impossible.</v>

594
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

595
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You put utopia is a touchy word.</v>

596
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I like the word sometimes it's just missed is finite</v>

597
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 5>only the best that we know up until now and the great flaws that we're not</v>

598
00:17:10.411 --> 00:17:13.410
<v Speaker 5>actually doing anything based on the knowledge we have today.</v>

599
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:14.250
<v Speaker 5>But to answer your question,</v>

600
00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:15.090
<v Speaker 5>how do we do that?</v>

601
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

602
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 5>how do we transition?</v>

603
00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:17.460
<v Speaker 5>The system is failing.</v>

604
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.110
<v Speaker 5>You have an unemployment crisis,</v>

605
00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:21.300
<v Speaker 5>we have a debt crisis and we have a,</v>

606
00:17:21.301 --> 00:17:22.134
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

607
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.830
<v Speaker 5>and we have a energy crisis that's looming.</v>

608
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Three of the nails in the coffin as far as I'm concerned,</v>

609
00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 5>that interweave in certain ways.</v>

610
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>We also have another crisis.</v>

611
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And that crisis is the way people raise children.</v>

612
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>We have the crisis of,</v>

613
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.890
<v Speaker 2>too many people that don't give a fuck about their kids and they're raising</v>

615
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>these little problems,</v>

616
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 2>these people that are,</v>

617
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:43.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 2>and the crisis of consciousness means for sure.</v>

619
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And that absolutely transmits from parent to children.</v>

620
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

621
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.191
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

622
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>when they're not paying attention to the kids or where they're bad parenting or</v>

623
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.061
<v Speaker 1>whatever they have.</v>

625
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:54.811
<v Speaker 1>Well that brings up the,</v>

626
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 1>he gets the same sort of,</v>

627
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like how do we change?</v>

628
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:57.954
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

629
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>How do we change society at the Cork is really,</v>

630
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:01.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to get to them too.</v>

631
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a big percentage of people that are impoverished and uneducated and strip</v>

632
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>

633
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It's great for a lot of things.</v>

634
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It's great for porn too.</v>

635
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Just we want a lot of chaos,</v>

638
00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:11.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 1>and you want a lot of messy things.</v>

640
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.674
<v Speaker 1>Great for fighting too.</v>

641
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

642
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's,</v>

643
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem,</v>

644
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:18.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

645
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:18.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

646
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:18.861
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

647
00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.820
<v Speaker 5>Hence the nature of what the zeitgeists wound that really defines itself as me.</v>

649
00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:23.680
<v Speaker 5>You can talk about these solution oriented things,</v>

650
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.000
<v Speaker 5>but really it's the,</v>

651
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.250
<v Speaker 5>it's the evolution of human awareness.</v>

652
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.980
<v Speaker 5>The real crisis is the crisis of ignorance.</v>

653
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.630
<v Speaker 5>There's no energy crisis.</v>

654
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.210
<v Speaker 5>It's really just a crisis of misunderstanding what we're doing</v>

655
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that people have become addicted to the money that's going around</v>

656
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.301
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

657
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:39.511
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

658
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the people that are taking money from corporations,</v>

659
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

660
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it stopped becoming a matter of whether or not it's a good thing.</v>

661
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

662
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it's precedented.</v>

663
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:48.301
<v Speaker 1>There's a precedent.</v>

664
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's already in place.</v>

665
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.041
<v Speaker 1>They're making the money.</v>

666
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>They're going to continue to make the money and then want to make the money.</v>

667
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And so anything where you say,</v>

668
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:53.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

669
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:54.361
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

670
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that what we're doing is really fair.</v>

671
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

672
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:58.530
<v Speaker 1>we're being unfairly influenced by corporations.</v>

673
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

674
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.233
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

675
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 1>we're making this fucking money.</v>

676
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 1>We've been making this money,</v>

677
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to make this money.</v>

678
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't just stop,</v>

679
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

681
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.250
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

682
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

683
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 5>That's why the failure is so important,</v>

684
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:09.901
<v Speaker 5>if you will.</v>

685
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:12.130
<v Speaker 5>The failure that's an on hand is not going to,</v>

686
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 5>is not going to be altered by any new legislations or any fail safes the</v>

687
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 5>establishment might have.</v>

688
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 5>There's no way this system can persist for a number of different reasons I could</v>

689
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:24.301
<v Speaker 5>throw out there,</v>

690
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:24.791
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

691
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:25.800
<v Speaker 5>the of occupy movement,</v>

692
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:26.041
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

693
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Everyone says maybe that at this point in time,</v>

694
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 5>the division of,</v>

695
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 5>of rich versus poor is more than it ever was.</v>

696
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:32.401
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>

697
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.234
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

698
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.721
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

699
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 5>It's always been structurally classed.</v>

700
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 5>There's a structural classes and built into this system occupies only been the</v>

701
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 5>first to really acknowledged that on the global scale of a,</v>

702
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:43.991
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

703
00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:44.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

704
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 5>an issue that's been there from the very beginning because every element of this</v>

705
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 5>system supports that annex getting worse.</v>

706
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.370
<v Speaker 5>We live in a plutonomy now there's more money moving amongst the upper five</v>

707
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 5>percentile influencing GDP.</v>

708
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 5>So much money that it makes the lower percentiles movements and money</v>

709
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 5>irrelevant.</v>

710
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 5>So on it from a firmly economic standpoint,</v>

711
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 5>the lower classes are literally irrelevant to the function of the economy.</v>

712
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 5>Therefore to the,</v>

713
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 5>to the powers that be,</v>

714
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.021
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

715
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 5>to the corporate establishment and to the taxation fueling and big business that</v>

716
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:15.324
<v Speaker 5>fuels all government.</v>

717
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And this is all because the system has been manipulated.</v>

718
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

719
00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:18.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

720
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.500
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

721
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.480
<v Speaker 5>is because the system is intrinsically flawed base based on the need for</v>

722
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:26.000
<v Speaker 5>differential advantage and an old form of tribalism,</v>

723
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.700
<v Speaker 5>psychological tribalism that you have to gain advantage over.</v>

724
00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:32.060
<v Speaker 5>Others is socially Darwinistic view and what's unique.</v>

725
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.420
<v Speaker 5>Even though I hold that to be self evident and true to the human condition,</v>

726
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.990
<v Speaker 5>if we're,</v>

727
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.290
<v Speaker 5>if we were both existing and extreme scarcity and we had nothing to eat,</v>

728
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 5>we end up finding each other most likely to survive.</v>

729
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:43.250
<v Speaker 5>That's a natural human instinct.</v>

730
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.410
<v Speaker 5>What's happened now though is that the,</v>

731
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm jumping ahead here but following me is that the entire infrastructure of</v>

732
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:50.180
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

733
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 5>the human population is so large,</v>

734
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 5>their industry has become so big.</v>

735
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.580
<v Speaker 5>We have the Fukushima meltdown,</v>

736
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 5>we have the nuclear weapons,</v>

737
00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 5>we have nano weapons that are on the horizon.</v>

738
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 5>What we have now is we can't have the risk of this type of mentality being the</v>

739
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.050
<v Speaker 5>forefront of our psychology.</v>

740
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 5>We can't have the self betterment of the individual to be the forefront of us</v>

741
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 5>because it goes against our longterm evolutionary fitness,</v>

742
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 5>which means the entire species at risk.</v>

743
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 5>So to put it in a sentence,</v>

744
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 5>the self interest that tends to dominate now that's that really is the</v>

745
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 5>psychological fuel of all the motivations that you see.</v>

746
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 5>The greed,</v>

747
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:25.564
<v Speaker 5>if fuel's degrees,</v>

748
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.690
<v Speaker 5>just an extension of the,</v>

749
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 5>the basic motivation is really no such thing as greed.</v>

750
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 5>It's just they're in the system.</v>

751
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:35.731
<v Speaker 5>All of that that you see is going to fuck us all up until we begin to realize</v>

752
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.170
<v Speaker 5>that we can't operate this way cause it's going to destroy us.</v>

753
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.273
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>

754
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 5>We nuclear war was the best example.</v>

755
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:41.621
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

756
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:43.400
<v Speaker 5>you don't need passports to a CEO.</v>

757
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:43.941
<v Speaker 5>The fallout,</v>

758
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:44.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

759
00:21:44.061 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 5>nuclear winter would have taken over the entire planet.</v>

760
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:47.820
<v Speaker 5>If the U S and uh,</v>

761
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 5>Russia went to nuclear war,</v>

762
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 5>even a minor war,</v>

763
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.520
<v Speaker 5>it would have destroyed almost the entire human species.</v>

764
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 5>And a few scientists realize that said,</v>

765
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

766
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.010
<v Speaker 5>This isn't really a partisan or a country or nationalist issue anymore.</v>

767
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 5>This is a life issue.</v>

768
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 5>So the greater our technology,</v>

769
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 5>the greater our ability,</v>

770
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 5>the greater vulnerability we have.</v>

771
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:09.901
<v Speaker 5>And the more clear it becomes how we have to unify and make our self interest</v>

772
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 5>become social interest if we intend to survive as a species.</v>

773
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 5>And this is the great paradigm shift of all human thought.</v>

774
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 5>So what do you do with all the weapons?</v>

775
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.393
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

776
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.211
<v Speaker 5>you get rid of them,</v>

777
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 5>dismantle them and hope you can regurgitate them into something defective.</v>

778
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if we were to take over the Pentagon and use their equipment for</v>

779
00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 5>monitoring the earth's resources.</v>

780
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 5>Use the amazing surveillance equipment to actually have a productive use.</v>

781
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:34.570
<v Speaker 5>It would be incredible.</v>

782
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I think everything you say is brilliant and I agree with it 100% but when I</v>

783
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.600
<v Speaker 2>think about it being implemented in today's society,</v>

784
00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I think of the human beings that exist right now and how they've been running</v>

785
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 2>their lives based on greed,</v>

786
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.860
<v Speaker 2>real greed based on real ignorance,</v>

787
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 2>based on violence.</v>

788
00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're going to get these people and everybody is going to go hold hands</v>

789
00:22:58.441 --> 00:23:00.000
<v Speaker 2>and sing Kumbaya together.</v>

790
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:00.751
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

791
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there has to be something,</v>

792
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.371
<v Speaker 2>you know there,</v>

793
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:06.060
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of event that unites people.</v>

794
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.120
<v Speaker 5>There's not going to be a stopping of the separation of rich and poor.</v>

795
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.790
<v Speaker 5>The rich are only going to get richer and smaller and smaller.</v>

796
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:12.031
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>

797
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 5>if you want to see anger,</v>

798
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.093
<v Speaker 5>just wait.</v>

799
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.971
<v Speaker 5>Just wait.</v>

800
00:23:14.971 --> 00:23:15.211
<v Speaker 5>Where are we?</v>

801
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Haven't even touched the anger stage as it were.</v>

802
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.870
<v Speaker 5>When you say that is what's going to start the initial transition into something</v>

803
00:23:21.871 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 5>new and the point of the movement really is not to try to initiate some step by</v>

804
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:29.490
<v Speaker 5>step logical transition to assume human beings are rational and they're just</v>

805
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:29.761
<v Speaker 5>going to say,</v>

806
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:29.911
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

807
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:30.511
<v Speaker 5>that sounds better.</v>

808
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:33.480
<v Speaker 5>That sounds more efficient now that that's not the way the human being works at</v>

809
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:33.751
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

810
00:23:33.751 --> 00:23:34.620
<v Speaker 5>at least at this stage.</v>

811
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.100
<v Speaker 5>So the failure will happen is like I said,</v>

812
00:23:37.101 --> 00:23:38.910
<v Speaker 5>movements on the sidelines as far as I'm concerned,</v>

813
00:23:38.911 --> 00:23:43.020
<v Speaker 5>trying to spread information about what a new social system may be exposing the</v>

814
00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 5>roots of this system and as this tipping point occurs,</v>

815
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 5>those that are on the outs will slowly become on the end and you'll have a very</v>

816
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 5>powerful large,</v>

817
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 5>complicated revolution that will happen one way or another.</v>

818
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 5>I had this and it's an inevitability to me,</v>

819
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 5>so all the rich 1.0% doesn't matter.</v>

820
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 5>Many billions of dollars they have the police are not going to protect them.</v>

821
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a very unique unpredictable shift in the human social</v>

822
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:09.390
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

823
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking movie,</v>

824
00:24:10.441 --> 00:24:11.130
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

825
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.640
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

826
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.421
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it an a movie?</v>

827
00:24:12.421 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean really a great time in the movie of its time when things get really</v>

828
00:24:15.961 --> 00:24:16.794
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>

829
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I've said about the occupy movement that to me,</v>

830
00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:20.220
<v Speaker 2>they're like white blood cells.</v>

831
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't know exactly why they're there,</v>

832
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:24.730
<v Speaker 2>but they know that there's an issue and they've the immune system,</v>

833
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a beer,</v>

834
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a sickness here.</v>

835
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Social Disorder.</v>

836
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a social immune system response.</v>

837
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.780
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

838
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just clogged up all the areas where there's corruption.</v>

839
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

840
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.641
<v Speaker 5>it's fascinating.</v>

841
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 5>It was a beautiful action.</v>

842
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:36.201
<v Speaker 5>Too Bad,</v>

843
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 5>the majority of the occupy movement hasn't been able to really put a train of</v>

844
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 5>thought forward that others can grasp.</v>

845
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 5>They have all this media,</v>

846
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:43.401
<v Speaker 5>all this press.</v>

847
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 5>I tried to,</v>

848
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've seen anything that I've tried to do with them.</v>

849
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 5>I've done,</v>

850
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I've done some talks in La in New York and just really trying to get some seeds</v>

851
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 5>planted as far as what a new social structure may be.</v>

852
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Cause he can complain all day until you put down to some fundamental logical</v>

853
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 5>elements that people can grab,</v>

854
00:24:56.451 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 5>expand and get into the public consciousness into the Zeitgeists we're doomed</v>

855
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:02.100
<v Speaker 5>until that happens.</v>

856
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.090
<v Speaker 5>This is going to be one iteration of,</v>

857
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.953
<v Speaker 5>of rogue.</v>

858
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.213
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

859
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the idea would be amazing to have uh,</v>

860
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 2>an entire culture filled with cool people and everybody works together.</v>

861
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

862
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.813
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

863
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.683
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>

864
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 2>could that work?</v>

865
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

866
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And if it was possible when anybody ever get anything done,</v>

867
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 2>would there be any more competition?</v>

868
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Would they be any more creativity with everybody just be</v>

869
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 2>banging each other and giving each other hugs.</v>

870
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 5>The Fun thing about modern,</v>

871
00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:35.830
<v Speaker 5>a sociological research is that a great number of studies have been done in</v>

872
00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:36.590
<v Speaker 5>those issues.</v>

873
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

874
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Incentive is a,</v>

875
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:41.920
<v Speaker 5>has been a large forest of the market system to assume if we're doing mechanical</v>

876
00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:45.040
<v Speaker 5>stuff yet I'm going to be on a conveyor line which can easily be automated now.</v>

877
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:45.620
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

878
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 5>be on a subway line.</v>

879
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 5>It just blows my mind.</v>

880
00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:50.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm walking into like a subway restaurant and there's this conveyor belt of</v>

881
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 5>people that you could automate in five seconds if you want to wasting their</v>

882
00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:54.731
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>

883
00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:54.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

884
00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:56.060
<v Speaker 5>you have to pay people for that.</v>

885
00:25:56.061 --> 00:25:57.310
<v Speaker 5>But when it comes to creativity,</v>

886
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 5>very few are actually motivated by money and money actually inhibits.</v>

887
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.220
<v Speaker 5>There's longer studies that are done by man named Daniel Pink called drive.</v>

888
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:04.810
<v Speaker 5>I recommend that book to anyone that's interested.</v>

889
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.631
<v Speaker 2>I would think that,</v>

890
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:05.931
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

891
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 2>if you were just concentrating on money and you would,</v>

892
00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 2>that you would lose part of your mental resources that you could have</v>

893
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on creativity.</v>

894
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.660
<v Speaker 5>So deep in inhibition,</v>

895
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.800
<v Speaker 5>everything I've ever done creatively have never money's a pollutant to me.</v>

896
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

897
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.250
<v Speaker 5>for anything that I've done pollutant,</v>

898
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 5>it hinders my creative response.</v>

899
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

900
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.980
<v Speaker 2>A fucker.</v>

901
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.650
<v Speaker 2>You a hundred percent fucking love money.</v>

902
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I love buying cool shit.</v>

903
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I like going to movies.</v>

904
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I like going to dinner and I don't have to worry how much it costs.</v>

905
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.631
<v Speaker 2>You hate money,</v>

906
00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:34.170
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

907
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:34.681
<v Speaker 2>I hate money,</v>

908
00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:35.101
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

909
00:26:35.101 --> 00:26:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I hate not to do limitless resources.</v>

910
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

911
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.110
<v Speaker 2>If I just didn't have,</v>

912
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

913
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.670
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with it.</v>

914
00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I hate dealing with bills.</v>

915
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 2>You hate it.</v>

916
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

917
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.290
<v Speaker 6>hate having money.</v>

918
00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:46.420
<v Speaker 6>I hate getting motherfucker.</v>

919
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 6>I hate having to deal with that part.</v>

920
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 6>I just like waking up doing what I wanted to do.</v>

921
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:51.670
<v Speaker 6>Creativity like,</v>

922
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:51.910
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

923
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 6>like not having to worry about that at all would be amazing</v>

924
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.430
<v Speaker 1>because they'll just go somewhere and give them your pictures and they give you</v>

925
00:26:57.431 --> 00:26:58.120
<v Speaker 1>some meat.</v>

926
00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.511
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

927
00:26:58.511 --> 00:26:59.201
<v Speaker 6>I mean again,</v>

928
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:02.740
<v Speaker 6>like of course that you have to get paid he to live,</v>

929
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.110
<v Speaker 6>but if that I could take that whole part out,</v>

930
00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.980
<v Speaker 6>that'd be amazing.</v>

931
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:06.550
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

932
00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:06.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

933
00:27:06.881 --> 00:27:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's the system that we're,</v>

934
00:27:08.081 --> 00:27:08.471
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

935
00:27:08.471 --> 00:27:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely not the best we can do.</v>

936
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.500
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

937
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:11.651
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

938
00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:13.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no way this is the best we can do,</v>

939
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.860
<v Speaker 1>especially the stock market.</v>

940
00:27:14.861 --> 00:27:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

941
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck if you understand it or not.</v>

942
00:27:16.931 --> 00:27:17.471
<v Speaker 1>I watch it.</v>

943
00:27:17.471 --> 00:27:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I watch those numbers scroll through the bottom of screen and there's</v>

944
00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.820
<v Speaker 1>some fucking dude with his,</v>

945
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.500
<v Speaker 1>his classical attire has traditional attire that he's wearing with his tie and</v>

946
00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 1>his his and he's moving around and pointing totally.</v>

947
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.360
<v Speaker 1>These different stocks are going up and down and you know,</v>

948
00:27:31.361 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on confidence though.</v>

949
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.000
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a shitbag system have you put together?</v>

950
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.030
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a Goofy fucking number game?</v>

951
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.050
<v Speaker 1>What's all going up and down and shorts and derivatives?</v>

952
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>You tell me what the fuck did derivative market is again,</v>

953
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.730
<v Speaker 1>why is it a hundred times bigger than the real market?</v>

954
00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:49.470
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

955
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.561
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

956
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 5>as much as I hate to admit it,</v>

957
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:53.960
<v Speaker 5>I was a private equity trader for about six years after I left was like,</v>

958
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.211
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

959
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 5>it was a personal choice to get out of the establishment.</v>

960
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

961
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 5>the only occupation in existence we don't have a boss or a client or reliant on</v>

962
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 5>an audience is in the equity trading.</v>

963
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.140
<v Speaker 5>So were you,</v>

964
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:04.441
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

965
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 5>is it like being an educated guesser?</v>

966
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.380
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it's like?</v>

967
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.640
<v Speaker 5>There's a huge strategy that's called technical analysis that people use.</v>

968
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 5>It's now it's automated behind the scenes by groups like Goldman Sachs that are</v>

969
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.351
<v Speaker 5>raping.</v>

970
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's slowly but surely.</v>

971
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

972
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 5>there's it from Ted.</v>

973
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 5>I had a lot of respect for the traders independently because of their mindset.</v>

974
00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 5>It's a great discipline.</v>

975
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like a sport you really have to know you're doing.</v>

976
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:26.641
<v Speaker 5>You can't just wing it,</v>

977
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:27.391
<v Speaker 5>it's not gambling.</v>

978
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 5>And then he kind of sense like that.</v>

979
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.750
<v Speaker 5>But as an institution,</v>

980
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 5>those stock market and the whole concept of these representations of equity and</v>

981
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 5>finance and how and how much influence it has in society,</v>

982
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:41.160
<v Speaker 5>and of course the Dalit driven is blow out and everything else that we've seen,</v>

983
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 5>it's the most cancerous thing on the face of the earth.</v>

984
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:44.941
<v Speaker 5>It stock market.</v>

985
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:45.774
<v Speaker 5>It's just unbelievable.</v>

986
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.280
<v Speaker 5>That's why it even exists at all.</v>

987
00:28:47.281 --> 00:28:48.114
<v Speaker 5>I have no clue.</v>

988
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate manifestation of the worst concept of having no social</v>

989
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:56.730
<v Speaker 5>contribution and invariably making more money than any other sector of the</v>

990
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:57.331
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>

991
00:28:57.331 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 5>Even though you create nothing,</v>

992
00:28:58.501 --> 00:28:59.334
<v Speaker 5>you'd do nothing.</v>

993
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 5>And it's just like Wall Street and Michael Douglas.</v>

994
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

995
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

996
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like I create nothing I own.</v>

997
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

998
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing that it's been able to get to the point where it is now.</v>

999
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.890
<v Speaker 5>It's just what a what an out of control ride and you guys,</v>

1000
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 5>they may like $40 million a year doing nothing.</v>

1001
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

1002
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.591
<v Speaker 5>And you say to yourself,</v>

1003
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:16.681
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1004
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:17.461
<v Speaker 5>here's the market system.</v>

1005
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 5>This is the capitalist concept,</v>

1006
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1007
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.673
<v Speaker 5>Oh everyone.</v>

1008
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.430
<v Speaker 5>If you do the most contribution,</v>

1009
00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 5>you supposed to get the most reward.</v>

1010
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:23.890
<v Speaker 5>That's the underlying tone.</v>

1011
00:29:23.891 --> 00:29:27.220
<v Speaker 5>So if you work really hard and didn't really want to and make that invention,</v>

1012
00:29:27.221 --> 00:29:28.740
<v Speaker 5>then you can contribute to society.</v>

1013
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 5>Now it's you better go.</v>

1014
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 5>You're only off of yourself.</v>

1015
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Fuck everybody else.</v>

1016
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.920
<v Speaker 5>That's what's rewarded in the system across the board and the market system is</v>

1017
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:41.250
<v Speaker 5>just the highest level of that psychological manifestation.</v>

1018
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Did it grow</v>

1019
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>too fast for our little monkey minds?</v>

1020
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

1021
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Did Technology and the concept of being able to control money and all the</v>

1022
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 1>different things that we have to deal with is variables didn't exist when our</v>

1023
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>minds are were created.</v>

1024
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Our DNA is essentially the same as it was 10,000 years ago.</v>

1025
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.681
<v Speaker 1>It's our DNA.</v>

1026
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It's really essentially set up for the natural world and then all of a sudden</v>

1027
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 1>we've shoved it into this weird new dimension where we're dealing with an</v>

1028
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of variables.</v>

1029
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with all kinds of craziness.</v>

1030
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:10.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1031
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:11.081
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1032
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:16.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the mind is set up to deal with the world that we've created,</v>

1033
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's like a kid at the helm of a car.</v>

1034
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 1>It does not drive and he stopped on the fucking gas,</v>

1035
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's too small to look over the over the dashboard so it is even know where</v>

1036
00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he's going.</v>

1037
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to figure this thing out as he goes along.</v>

1038
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden this little kid has a car,</v>

1039
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.771
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1040
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it's like with us.</v>

1041
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Like we're like these dumb fucking monkeys and we're,</v>

1042
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:42.061
<v Speaker 1>we're still evolving out of that dumb monkey primal soup and popping out where</v>

1043
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:42.701
<v Speaker 1>we're at.</v>

1044
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 1>This monkey that's aware of itself.</v>

1045
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 1>And then in the process of becoming aware of itself,</v>

1046
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>barely getting our shit together,</v>

1047
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 1>we've created everything.</v>

1048
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:55.261
<v Speaker 1>We've created nuclear fucking bombs and cell phones and video that you can get a</v>

1049
00:30:55.871 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 1>little screening your pocket and the ability to do things that we would have</v>

1050
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>never thought possible.</v>

1051
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Just 50607080100 years ago.</v>

1052
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1053
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like no one could have managed this.</v>

1054
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it blew up sure.</v>

1055
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Faster than our reasoning.</v>

1056
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 5>Evolution is always natural one way or another.</v>

1057
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Whether we destroy ourselves well then I guess the human species was</v>

1058
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.500
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary culdesac it's one way or another.</v>

1059
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 5>Everything is always right.</v>

1060
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:21.851
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1061
00:31:21.851 --> 00:31:22.930
<v Speaker 5>There's no wrongs here,</v>

1062
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 5>but you know the,</v>

1063
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:27.460
<v Speaker 5>the disorder that's in place in society is what concerns me,</v>

1064
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 5>which is what you alluded to at the beginning.</v>

1065
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 5>You have this huge disorder based on the system that's basically a self</v>

1066
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.121
<v Speaker 5>destructive system.</v>

1067
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:34.871
<v Speaker 5>It's not respected.</v>

1068
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Any general variables of resource management,</v>

1069
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:37.564
<v Speaker 5>it's not respecting,</v>

1070
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.723
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1071
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 5>I saw a recent status at,</v>

1072
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:40.451
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1073
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:41.910
<v Speaker 5>China has less uh,</v>

1074
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 5>unemployment than America because they're lax EPA,</v>

1075
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 5>if you were wherever they have in China,</v>

1076
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:47.740
<v Speaker 5>the lax environmental issues,</v>

1077
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 5>like we should be more like China and reduce our environmental things and they</v>

1078
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 5>have like huge smog thing and it's just disgusting destroying ourselves.</v>

1079
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 5>One town where they say it's like smoking two packs of cigarettes a day,</v>

1080
00:31:57.701 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 5>just living there.</v>

1081
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 5>The skies were like dark gray.</v>

1082
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.073
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

1083
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 5>it's a disorder that we don't even see it and we just keep killing ourselves.</v>

1084
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's</v>

1085
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.190
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1086
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Is it because we still recognize ourselves as individuals and we still haven't</v>

1087
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:17.250
<v Speaker 1>realized that we are a part of a giant super organism that is the human race.</v>

1088
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So because people are acting as individuals and then they could do so as a</v>

1089
00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:22.920
<v Speaker 1>corporation and do so without guilt.</v>

1090
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.190
<v Speaker 1>They act as individuals all going towards one goal,</v>

1091
00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but under the guise that the company's doing it in the best interest of business</v>

1092
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.670
<v Speaker 1>and then they're able to get away with a lot of shit that you just can't get</v>

1093
00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:33.351
<v Speaker 1>away with in a,</v>

1094
00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:34.620
<v Speaker 1>in a one on one basis</v>

1095
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking of human beings as a whole.</v>

1096
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Putting that at the front</v>

1097
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.843
<v Speaker 2>of your ethic,</v>

1098
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that's like not even a consideration.</v>

1099
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like what can we get away with?</v>

1100
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:44.890
<v Speaker 2>What's legal?</v>

1101
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1103
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's not our fault if it's legal,</v>

1104
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.041
<v Speaker 5>go back.</v>

1105
00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 5>I go back to my early life.</v>

1106
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.250
<v Speaker 5>I had a normal upbringing,</v>

1107
00:32:51.251 --> 00:32:51.760
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1108
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.500
<v Speaker 5>I did all sorts of shit out of college that was highly illegal reselling things.</v>

1109
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:58.030
<v Speaker 5>Just it was whatever you can do to make money,</v>

1110
00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.900
<v Speaker 5>it didn't matter.</v>

1111
00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.920
<v Speaker 5>And everyone did too.</v>

1112
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.920
<v Speaker 5>It was whatever you needed to do to get money.</v>

1113
00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:05.650
<v Speaker 5>And what's happened now with the value system disorder is that since that's the</v>

1114
00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:06.400
<v Speaker 5>pursuit,</v>

1115
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.020
<v Speaker 5>that's the divine drive of the system.</v>

1116
00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:12.100
<v Speaker 5>That's what status is defined by its what your success is defined by that.</v>

1117
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Everyone can blindly look the other way with how much destruction is occurring</v>

1118
00:33:15.191 --> 00:33:15.581
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>

1119
00:33:15.581 --> 00:33:18.340
<v Speaker 5>They can look the other way with the wars and the cancers and,</v>

1120
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.480
<v Speaker 5>and the just every natural phenomenon that we've come to to disintegrate the,</v>

1121
00:33:22.481 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 5>all the trash that's surrounding the planet right now.</v>

1122
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1123
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.510
<v Speaker 2>like in the war too,</v>

1124
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.040
<v Speaker 2>the way people react,</v>

1125
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.180
<v Speaker 2>if you know that someone in their family has been molesting someone,</v>

1126
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.320
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they don't want to know the Lord looking away.</v>

1127
00:33:37.321 --> 00:33:38.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to think about it.</v>

1128
00:33:38.881 --> 00:33:40.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to do it that way.</v>

1129
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.670
<v Speaker 2>If there was right next door,</v>

1130
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:43.200
<v Speaker 2>we'd be thinking about it every fucking day.</v>

1131
00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:46.660
<v Speaker 2>The fact that people can just commonly accept the fact that there's no for,</v>

1132
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.380
<v Speaker 2>for no reason whatsoever that you could ever argue we're,</v>

1133
00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:54.381
<v Speaker 2>we have thousands of dudes with guns in some other part of the world and it</v>

1134
00:33:55.051 --> 00:33:55.591
<v Speaker 2>seems normal,</v>

1135
00:33:55.591 --> 00:33:55.971
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

1136
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:58.830
<v Speaker 2>And it seems normal because it's a part of life and people are born into this</v>

1137
00:33:58.831 --> 00:33:59.311
<v Speaker 2>normality.</v>

1138
00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:00.031
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any better.</v>

1139
00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:00.864
<v Speaker 2>So exactly.</v>

1140
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.460
<v Speaker 2>So it is what it is because we feel like the system must be smarter than us.</v>

1141
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:05.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1142
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:06.331
<v Speaker 2>it's big,</v>

1143
00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:06.751
<v Speaker 2>it's huge,</v>

1144
00:34:06.751 --> 00:34:07.584
<v Speaker 2>it's gigantic,</v>

1145
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:07.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

1147
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's a group of Goddamn individuals with their own personal interest at hand</v>

1148
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and their personal interests will extend to killing people and profiting off of</v>

1149
00:34:15.961 --> 00:34:17.310
<v Speaker 2>it if they can get away with it.</v>

1150
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.220
<v Speaker 5>My favorite example of that concept was remember the movie network,</v>

1151
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.440
<v Speaker 5>which I have little skit mad as hell number when they got frustrated the very</v>

1152
00:34:25.441 --> 00:34:28.440
<v Speaker 5>end because they were losing money with the character and they sit around and</v>

1153
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:29.220
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

1154
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.060
<v Speaker 5>well we could kill him.</v>

1155
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.030
<v Speaker 5>And he you think is the audience member that they're just joking.</v>

1156
00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:34.170
<v Speaker 5>You think someone that runs on the go,</v>

1157
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.651
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1158
00:34:34.651 --> 00:34:35.484
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1159
00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.300
<v Speaker 5>but then they're like,</v>

1160
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:36.541
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1161
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:37.051
<v Speaker 5>if we do it,</v>

1162
00:34:37.051 --> 00:34:38.070
<v Speaker 5>we have to be very careful.</v>

1163
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.320
<v Speaker 5>Then the film ends right there.</v>

1164
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.910
<v Speaker 5>So you think about that logic,</v>

1165
00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Speaker 5>a human life becomes quite secondary to the most,</v>

1166
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.371
<v Speaker 5>the motivations,</v>

1167
00:34:44.371 --> 00:34:47.490
<v Speaker 5>especially the higher you go up in this sort of corporate neuroses.</v>

1168
00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1169
00:34:48.281 --> 00:34:48.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
00:34:48.611 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 2>it's why I've argued before with people about,</v>

1171
00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:51.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.881
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1173
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.430
<v Speaker 2>this September 11th especially that the,</v>

1174
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've heard more conversations about,</v>

1175
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.260
<v Speaker 2>what people think happened September 11th and I believe this and I believe that.</v>

1177
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And from,</v>

1178
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.410
<v Speaker 2>from the very moment I've said,</v>

1179
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe that they'd be willing.</v>

1180
00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that people did orchestrate any sort of attacks on America.</v>

1181
00:35:10.841 --> 00:35:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they let,</v>

1182
00:35:11.681 --> 00:35:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything,</v>

1183
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.760
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying is that we know that they went to war and they said that</v>

1184
00:35:17.891 --> 00:35:20.020
<v Speaker 2>there was weapons of mass destruction when there weren't.</v>

1185
00:35:20.021 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 2>So they're willing to kill some people that they don't know.</v>

1186
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>

1187
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.920
<v Speaker 2>They know that the very least they're willing to kill some people that they</v>

1188
00:35:26.921 --> 00:35:29.050
<v Speaker 2>don't know in order to push their own agenda.</v>

1189
00:35:29.051 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 2>We know that</v>

1190
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.230
<v Speaker 5>just like when they opened Wall Street,</v>

1191
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.950
<v Speaker 5>the toxic air and the thousands that have gotten sick since then,</v>

1192
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>my take on it is they don't know you either,</v>

1193
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>so you</v>

1194
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 1>don't think they would kill you.</v>

1195
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1196
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You really think that the p anybody that would orchestrate death for profit,</v>

1197
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't think they would kill you.</v>

1198
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:48.170
<v Speaker 1>You really think that they would because you're a US citizen.</v>

1199
00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Just the nature of the,</v>

1200
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.400
<v Speaker 1>of the team,</v>

1201
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the entire and the entire military,</v>

1202
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>industrial establishment.</v>

1203
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a killing machines.</v>

1204
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 1>wink.</v>

1206
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't use that in domestic purposes and not to mention there's so many</v>

1207
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:57.931
<v Speaker 1>examples of that,</v>

1208
00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>their history that people would blindly look at where the quorum,</v>

1209
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just so sad.</v>

1210
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's offensive when someone says that you're unpatriotic when you see</v>

1211
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 1>that and when you see that and you point that out,</v>

1212
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:05.821
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1213
00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know that is patriotic.</v>

1214
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.400
<v Speaker 1>That is very patriotic because that's not what we're supposed to be about.</v>

1215
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That's not what this country was supposed to be founded for this,</v>

1216
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 1>this country was supposed to be the best alternative.</v>

1217
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 1>This country was supposed to be the people that got it together.</v>

1218
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:18.901
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1219
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:19.131
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1220
00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 1>we have to fucking rules,</v>

1221
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:20.611
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1222
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:21.091
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rule.</v>

1223
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 1>We separate this from that.</v>

1224
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:22.861
<v Speaker 1>We do this,</v>

1225
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

1226
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 1>We don't let anybody do this.</v>

1227
00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:24.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1228
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 1>don't give up your liberties.</v>

1229
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to have essential liberties.</v>

1230
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to have guns.</v>

1231
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.501
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1232
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You gotta protect yourself from enemies,</v>

1233
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 1>foreign and domestic.</v>

1234
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1235
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it was all set up.</v>

1236
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It was all set up.</v>

1237
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1238
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.890
<v Speaker 1>They knew.</v>

1239
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 1>We could argue a little nuances of the founders,</v>

1240
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but I understand your point.</v>

1241
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:39.721
<v Speaker 1>That was one thing.</v>

1242
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:39.961
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

1243
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 1>did you hear this fucking dummy Newt Gingrich?</v>

1244
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 1>This would be king fat headed clown.</v>

1245
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 1>This guy actually said that he believed that the founding fathers would be much</v>

1246
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive in the way they would prosecute people for marijuana and that</v>

1247
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:55.000
<v Speaker 1>they would do it probably more violent.</v>

1248
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 1>They were growing it themselves.</v>

1249
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.020
<v Speaker 1>When they growing it themselves.</v>

1250
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:03.021
<v Speaker 1>It's says in George Washington's fucking diaries that he was separating the mail</v>

1251
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:04.980
<v Speaker 1>from the female plant.</v>

1252
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear that he says he was separating the mail from the female plant</v>

1253
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 1>for people don't know when you're growing marijuana,</v>

1254
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you've got to separate the mail from the female plant so that the female grows</v>

1255
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 1>the buds and that that becomes psychedelic.</v>

1256
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 1>That's how you make it.</v>

1257
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 1>So you'd get high from it.</v>

1258
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1259
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 1>So George Washington is essentially saying he likes to get high,</v>

1260
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1261
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1262
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:24.481
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

1263
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:25.171
<v Speaker 1>a little too late.</v>

1264
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So he's a fucking stoner.</v>

1265
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>He separated them too late.</v>

1266
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1267
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 1>what did you have to do back then?</v>

1268
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1269
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:33.840
<v Speaker 1>how many different things that you have going on with George Washington was a</v>

1270
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 1>fucking stoner dude?</v>

1271
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Almost a hundred percent God bless for sure.</v>

1272
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:38.814
<v Speaker 1>They grew it.</v>

1273
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.631
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1274
00:37:39.631 --> 00:37:40.970
<v Speaker 1>they grew hemp and they,</v>

1275
00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:41.281
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1276
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:41.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:44.340
<v Speaker 1>they grew hamping cause they used it for a lot of things outside of the</v>

1278

<v Speaker 1>psychoactive effects.</v>

1279

00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Like Leonardo Dicaprio in titanic.</v>

1355
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.420
<v Speaker 1>He's at the front of the Jesus ship with his arms up in the air.</v>

1356
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>

1360
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Sue Super Jesus.</v>

1361
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 1>He's pushing it hard,</v>

1362
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but an amazing group of humans we have trying to be at the helm.</v>

1363
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Michele Bachmann and a gay husband to this.</v>

1364
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:14.291
<v Speaker 1>If it's really good.</v>

1365
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a Goddamn Coen brothers movie.</v>

1366
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 1>We're living in a Coen brothers movie and a real good one.</v>

1367
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 5>No satirical one at that.</v>

1368
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:20.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a big football game and it's sad to me to see how you can't watch the news</v>

1370
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 5>at that than covering this as though it's relevant or important to anything.</v>

1371
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 5>There's no any decision processes that these people will have the power to take</v>

1372
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:36.271
<v Speaker 5>hold of will actually accomplish anything when it's obvious from our last great</v>

1373
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Speaker 5>hope Obama,</v>

1374
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 5>that big business isn't going anywhere.</v>

1375
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.031
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1376
00:39:42.031 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1377
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter who's in Pa,</v>

1378
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.500
<v Speaker 5>even Ron Paul,</v>

1379
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 5>if he was magically to be swept in with bulletproof vest on and everything else,</v>

1380
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 5>you'll see some dramatic shifts in his policy the moment he comes in because he</v>

1381
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

1382
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 5>he knows what's actually possible in that environment before the shitstorm hits</v>

1383
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 5>them from all sides,</v>

1384
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.520
<v Speaker 5>all the examples of what they did to Ralph Nader.</v>

1385
00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:04.920
<v Speaker 5>You know with the prostitution thing on it.</v>

1386
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 5>Remember that the car company,</v>

1387
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 5>there was a basically a car company set up Ralph Nader and in a hotel room with</v>

1388
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 5>a prostitute and then documented it cause he was doing all this publicity</v>

1389
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 5>against this car company.</v>

1390
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.920
<v Speaker 5>How unsafe they're there.</v>

1391
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.250
<v Speaker 5>They're cutting costs on their car production.</v>

1392
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 5>He found out very discreetly how bad it was.</v>

1393
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:26.200
<v Speaker 5>People were dying and they'd try to set them up and to make them look bad with</v>

1394
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:28.000
<v Speaker 5>this prostitute was incredible.</v>

1395
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.250
<v Speaker 5>That's just the tip of the iceberg of all sorts of games that are played.</v>

1396
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:32.950
<v Speaker 5>You can go straight down the whole political spectrum and looked at all the</v>

1397
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 5>things that seem random,</v>

1398
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 5>the wind ski and all these things.</v>

1399
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.491
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

1400
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 5>there's a subtle orchestration happening to that.</v>

1401
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Not to be conspiratorially oriented,</v>

1402
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:41.590
<v Speaker 5>but that's just the way it is.</v>

1403
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 5>You don't mess around.</v>

1404
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a mafia system.</v>

1405
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 5>I want to know where to get casting for that cause I would love to be a part of</v>

1406
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:48.790
<v Speaker 5>the next one.</v>

1407
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1408
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 5>like I'm found in Obama's locker room</v>

1409
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:53.980
<v Speaker 5>and I can't walk and</v>

1410
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 1>well they must hire it through craigslist.</v>

1411
00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean at this point in time they can easily pay someone to just fuck up your</v>

1412
00:41:02.101 --> 00:41:02.810
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1413
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1414
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:07.380
<v Speaker 1>pay someone like this is your job be $250,000 your job is to seduce that guy and</v>

1415
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.700
<v Speaker 1>go and get it into his life.</v>

1416
00:41:08.701 --> 00:41:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another.</v>

1417
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.070
<v Speaker 1>They're called PR agencies.</v>

1418
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they do?</v>

1419
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1420
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.701
<v Speaker 5>can go both sides.</v>

1421
00:41:13.701 --> 00:41:16.440
<v Speaker 5>They can be positive towards you or they can be hired to be completely black</v>

1422
00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:16.641
<v Speaker 5>lifts.</v>

1423
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:17.690
<v Speaker 5>Do gonna make you look like shit.</v>

1424
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.770
<v Speaker 5>I know that from my own experience of the weird things that have happened to me,</v>

1425
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.440
<v Speaker 5>which I wonder where the roots of some of these things are.</v>

1426
00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:27.090
<v Speaker 5>There's people that blog and anti psychiatry,</v>

1427
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Peter Joseph matters every single day and follow everything I did like how do</v>

1428
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 5>they possibly have time do that</v>

1429
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.710
<v Speaker 6>and it makes me think they're being paid to do it.</v>

1430
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I just know of some companies that were listed to me that do the exact</v>

1431
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 6>same thing to other people and you don't see them on the forefront.</v>

1432
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 6>There are these PR firms that you can use to,</v>

1433
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 6>you've probably seen the ones that you can go and use to get bad things removed</v>

1434
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 6>from your name on the Internet.</v>

1435
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.790
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that on the radio or something like that.</v>

1436
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.251
<v Speaker 6>So there's,</v>

1437
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:56.850
<v Speaker 6>there's ones that worked the other direction.</v>

1438
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 6>The more of a black op kind of way.</v>

1439
00:41:59.580 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1440
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 6>and they're paid to do so.</v>

1441
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:01.311
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1442
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 6>That's really an important stars right now.</v>

1443
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 6>Really go after porn stars.</v>

1444
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.023
<v Speaker 6>There was a,</v>

1445
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 6>this one person broke into a word.</v>

1446
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 6>They get tested once a month.</v>

1447
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 6>I think I might've talked about this before in broken and still all the records</v>

1448
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 6>from all the porn stars and then put them online and then that shit got taken</v>

1449
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 6>down eventually and it found out it was just this male porn started.</v>

1450
00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:26.951
<v Speaker 6>I did it and then now there's like groups of people that use all those things</v>

1451
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 6>that were put online and attack every single porn start online by putting their</v>

1452
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 6>information everywhere.</v>

1453
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck is with people.</v>

1454
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.620
<v Speaker 6>Why would they want to do that?</v>

1455
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:37.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1456
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.130
<v Speaker 6>A few different motivations there.</v>

1457
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.760
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1458
00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.420
<v Speaker 7>just so it's a weird thing man to we're thing that you know,</v>

1459
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.840
<v Speaker 7>people want to hurt other people that badly self appointed guardians of the</v>

1460
00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:51.300
<v Speaker 7>status quo that could be labeled a lot.</v>

1461
00:42:51.301 --> 00:42:52.860
<v Speaker 7>I picked up a man named jock fresco.</v>

1462
00:42:52.861 --> 00:42:53.820
<v Speaker 7>These people that they have,</v>

1463
00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:54.600
<v Speaker 7>they're not,</v>

1464
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.420
<v Speaker 7>the only thing they have is their identity preservation.</v>

1465
00:42:57.421 --> 00:43:01.080
<v Speaker 7>They will fight tooth and nail to make sure whatever they believe is held true.</v>

1466
00:43:01.081 --> 00:43:02.640
<v Speaker 7>Whether it's political or religious.</v>

1467
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:03.571
<v Speaker 7>I mean I could,</v>

1468
00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:06.600
<v Speaker 7>I can't count how many death threats I got since the first film came out.</v>

1469
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:06.781
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1470
00:43:06.781 --> 00:43:08.580
<v Speaker 7>you're quite just questioning the status quo.</v>

1471
00:43:08.581 --> 00:43:10.080
<v Speaker 7>All they're doing is fucking on camera.</v>

1472
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.190
<v Speaker 7>Why would somebody want to jet harm?</v>

1473
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:12.631
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1474
00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:13.021
<v Speaker 7>because if,</v>

1475
00:43:13.021 --> 00:43:17.190
<v Speaker 7>say some deeply religious individuals sees a porno or catches this sun with it</v>

1476
00:43:17.191 --> 00:43:18.150
<v Speaker 7>or something like that,</v>

1477
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.700
<v Speaker 7>they feel a huge threat there for whatever purpose.</v>

1478
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 7>You'd be surprised what motivations people,</v>

1479
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.240
<v Speaker 7>that's the root cause.</v>

1480
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:24.720
<v Speaker 7>The root,</v>

1481
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.110
<v Speaker 7>the root issue is how fucking dumb people are and what a giant percentage of</v>

1482
00:43:28.111 --> 00:43:30.270
<v Speaker 7>them are just so off the tracks and in the woods,</v>

1483
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.600
<v Speaker 7>misinformed a condition.</v>

1484
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 7>How do you turn those folks around?</v>

1485
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.670
<v Speaker 7>Cause I think you can't really have this next level society until you get those</v>

1486
00:43:38.671 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 7>folks to uh,</v>

1487
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.040
<v Speaker 7>on track.</v>

1488
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.890
<v Speaker 7>Look if that's one of the things about living in a nice neighborhood.</v>

1489
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.390
<v Speaker 7>If you live in a nice neighborhood,</v>

1490
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:45.721
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1491
00:43:45.721 --> 00:43:48.060
<v Speaker 7>there's generally a lot less financial strife.</v>

1492
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.950
<v Speaker 7>So people are a little bit more calm.</v>

1493
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.281
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1494
00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:52.530
<v Speaker 7>it's one of the things that people don't like about living in neighborhoods</v>

1495
00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:53.364
<v Speaker 7>where people are poor.</v>

1496
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.240
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1497
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.790
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of tension and sometimes shit goes down.</v>

1498
00:43:56.791 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

1499
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:57.750
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1500
00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.960
<v Speaker 7>you got to get everybody to the level of no tension,</v>

1501
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1502
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.340
<v Speaker 7>in order to have a,</v>

1503
00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:04.620
<v Speaker 7>a beautiful society.</v>

1504
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:05.940
<v Speaker 7>How the hell do you do that?</v>

1505
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.380
<v Speaker 7>As you pointed out earlier,</v>

1506
00:44:07.381 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 7>you start with the kids,</v>

1507
00:44:08.401 --> 00:44:08.791
<v Speaker 7>you make,</v>

1508
00:44:08.791 --> 00:44:09.000
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1509
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.510
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

1510
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.250
<v Speaker 7>there's a deeply religious,</v>

1511
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1512
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.030
<v Speaker 6>anti structure thing going on in the world where everyone thinks they can just</v>

1513
00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:16.960
<v Speaker 6>keep having kids.</v>

1514
00:44:16.961 --> 00:44:18.760
<v Speaker 6>And it doesn't matter what the resources of the planet,</v>

1515
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1516
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:19.950
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1517
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:20.770
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter that no.</v>

1518
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 6>Dot.</v>

1519
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 6>Don't you dare tell them how to raise their kids,</v>

1520
00:44:22.871 --> 00:44:24.100
<v Speaker 6>forget any kind of instruction.</v>

1521
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:24.390
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1522
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 6>that he kids,</v>

1523
00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.070
<v Speaker 6>people have natural pre-programming.</v>

1524
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty obvious what the men did.</v>

1525
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:31.060
<v Speaker 6>You Watch that guy's moving forward a whole,</v>

1526
00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.240
<v Speaker 6>and that's the very beginning.</v>

1527
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 5>I was like us moving forward on the development of kids now it little small</v>

1528
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 5>nuances can mess them up for the rest of their lives.</v>

1529
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.730
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's goes to drug addiction,</v>

1530
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 5>whether it goes to mental disorders or even physical disorders and no attention</v>

1531
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:43.141
<v Speaker 5>has been put on there.</v>

1532
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 5>If there's anything that I would like to see put in the public educational</v>

1533
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.181
<v Speaker 5>fountain,</v>

1534
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 5>it would be how to really think about your kids,</v>

1535
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 5>how important it is,</v>

1536
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 5>how the earliest things that happened to them all fucked them up the rest of</v>

1537
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:55.291
<v Speaker 5>their lives.</v>

1538
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 5>If they're not carefully,</v>

1539
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 5>carefully collard or carefully orchestrated Lawan vulnerability.</v>

1540
00:45:00.301 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about like holding kids down and making them do things in a</v>

1541
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:03.684
<v Speaker 5>structured way.</v>

1542
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 5>It's allowing the vulnerability of this natural organism to come to fruition.</v>

1543
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:07.651
<v Speaker 5>A Horse,</v>

1544
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:08.101
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1545
00:45:08.101 --> 00:45:10.640
<v Speaker 5>falls right out of the horse that Boren faltered.</v>

1546
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 5>They can walk boom,</v>

1547
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 5>humans because of evolution,</v>

1548
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.910
<v Speaker 5>they come out way too early.</v>

1549
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 5>So the susceptibility of the,</v>

1550
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:16.800
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>

1551
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 5>the infant is so massive and so misunderstood.</v>

1552
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Up until now that people have done things to their kids that have really fucked</v>

1553
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.700
<v Speaker 5>them up for their whole lives at the infancy stage because of how much</v>

1554
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 5>developmental requirements are actually,</v>

1555
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:28.711
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1556
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 5>the protections are gone.</v>

1557
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.430
<v Speaker 5>So it's a huge topic and there's a lot of people I could list,</v>

1558
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:33.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1559
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 5>that can,</v>

1560
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 5>that can describe those issues in tax.</v>

1561
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:36.841
<v Speaker 5>The got him gathered.</v>

1562
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 5>Mateo has a really good one.</v>

1563
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.700
<v Speaker 2>So what is the best case scenario?</v>

1564
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:43.540
<v Speaker 2>It was the best case scenario that the [inaudible] movement takes place after</v>

1565
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:48.541
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a collapse and we develop a new society that's based on using of</v>

1566
00:45:48.971 --> 00:45:52.300
<v Speaker 2>natural resources universally and across the board,</v>

1567
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:54.950
<v Speaker 2>and there's no hierarchy of citizenship and,</v>

1568
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.430
<v Speaker 2>and then the people are on the outside.</v>

1569
00:45:57.431 --> 00:45:57.851
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>

1570
00:45:57.851 --> 00:45:58.720
<v Speaker 2>We fight them off.</v>

1571
00:45:59.340 --> 00:45:59.581
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1572
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 5>you would want to hope it's hard to put join.</v>

1573
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:06.480
<v Speaker 5>You'd want to hope that whatever the cataclysmic may manifest itself to be,</v>

1574
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 5>that's pending,</v>

1575
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 5>that those on the sidelines,</v>

1576
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 5>that barbarians at the gate as they might have been,</v>

1577
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 5>would eventually turn it around to see the folly of their ways as well.</v>

1578
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:15.511
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1579
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to predict.</v>

1580
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like I smooth.</v>

1581
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.170
<v Speaker 5>It was really a movement of logic and reason.</v>

1582
00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:19.381
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1583
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:19.591
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1584
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:19.810
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

1585
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.011
<v Speaker 5>we have,</v>

1586
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:21.450
<v Speaker 5>we have technological automation.</v>

1587
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.410
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1588
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.810
<v Speaker 5>People are being replaced by automation.</v>

1589
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.121
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1590
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 5>the great driver of unemployment now is automation.</v>

1591
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.203
<v Speaker 5>They won't admit it.</v>

1592
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 5>Most economists will not,</v>

1593
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 5>a few are coming out now in the medium that you can go back to the Roosevelt</v>

1594
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:31.561
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>

1595
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 5>They actually wanted to have a stop on technological invention during the</v>

1596
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 5>industrial revolution because of how fast people were being replaced by</v>

1597
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:40.314
<v Speaker 5>machines.</v>

1598
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.100
<v Speaker 5>And that is the core driver of all unemployment you see in the world today</v>

1599
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

1600
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:46.111
<v Speaker 5>So what does that mean?</v>

1601
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 5>What is the logic say?</v>

1602
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:48.540
<v Speaker 5>Well we can produce more with less.</v>

1603
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 5>We don't need people to slave over some shitty factory job anymore.</v>

1604
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.030
<v Speaker 5>We automated no vacations,</v>

1605
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 5>higher,</v>

1606
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 5>much higher degree of accuracy.</v>

1607
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Machines can do things.</v>

1608
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.480
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of a modular machines now that can do things like scientific</v>

1609
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:01.290
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

1610
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 5>extremely specific things,</v>

1611
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.320
<v Speaker 5>thinking machines,</v>

1612
00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:07.740
<v Speaker 5>people like Ray Kurzweil and all this massive evolution I could ramble on for a</v>

1613
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

1614
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean for Human Labor?</v>

1615
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.290
<v Speaker 5>Do we keep human labor as a requirement to live your right to life is to get</v>

1616
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 5>income or do you create a new system that says,</v>

1617
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1618
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 5>let's go full forward with machine automation,</v>

1619
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 5>all sectors possible and fill in the gaps with whomever is willing to do so.</v>

1620
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.940
<v Speaker 5>And I think the abundance produced when enable US society to exist without</v>

1621
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 5>people needing money every minute of the day.</v>

1622
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 5>What happens</v>

1623
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 7>to all those people that were working on those assembly jobs?</v>

1624
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.780
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1625
00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 7>they at this stage they wouldn't know what the fuck to do,</v>

1626
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1627
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 7>But if you evolve it out,</v>

1628
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 7>if you really think about this for long periods of time,</v>

1629
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 7>you get the problem we're going to have to face eventually.</v>

1630
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 7>Well face it now tell until later,</v>

1631
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:45.490
<v Speaker 7>until you see someone in power say,</v>

1632
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:45.791
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1633
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 7>we're going to start to automate and basically do a form of socialization if you</v>

1634
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:49.901
<v Speaker 7>will,</v>

1635
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:53.910
<v Speaker 7>giving people free food free energy in order to supplement them for their law,</v>

1636
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 7>their lack of purchasing power,</v>

1637
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 7>which is what's happening and tell someone starts to do that in government or</v>

1638
00:47:58.301 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 7>having the workday.</v>

1639
00:47:59.650 --> 00:47:59.831
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1640
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 7>if Obama was smart and good Bunch of Roosevelt administration,</v>

1641
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.340
<v Speaker 7>they would have put in uh,</v>

1642
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.610
<v Speaker 7>a mandate or whatever you'd want to call it,</v>

1643
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:10.450
<v Speaker 7>where the corporations received some type of subsidy where they would have the</v>

1644
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 7>work day and they would hire twice the amount of people for that corporation,</v>

1645
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 7>giving them the sustenance income.</v>

1646
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 7>The that would be,</v>

1647
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 7>that would be applicable would be probably a little bit reduced.</v>

1648
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 7>But what else do you do?</v>

1649
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.750
<v Speaker 7>They're not going to do that because the core motivations,</v>

1650
00:48:21.751 --> 00:48:22.584
<v Speaker 7>so against it,</v>

1651
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 7>corporations responsibilities to the shareholders.</v>

1652
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 7>Shareholders don't want to see anything like that.</v>

1653
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 7>What happens when someone lays a whole bunch of employees and stock market and</v>

1654
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:29.854
<v Speaker 7>the stock goes up?</v>

1655
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 7>Remember it's just sick.</v>

1656
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:32.321
<v Speaker 7>The whole things backwards.</v>

1657
00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 7>So back to my point and tell automation,</v>

1658
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.553
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1659
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 7>no one's going to stop automation cause it's a profit driven thing.</v>

1660
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 7>It costs less money to automate than it does to use people.</v>

1661
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.080
<v Speaker 7>And that's what you call the contradiction of capitalism.</v>

1662
00:48:44.081 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 7>And the words of Karl Marx,</v>

1663
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:46.114
<v Speaker 7>believe it or not,</v>

1664
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 7>he recognizes this logo and all you have is this thing collaging together.</v>

1665
00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:51.940
<v Speaker 7>That is unreconcilable.</v>

1666
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 7>And tell a new social system system is put in place,</v>

1667
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 7>what do you think is going to happen with the current system?</v>

1668
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 7>How much time do you think we have before?</v>

1669
00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:00.340
<v Speaker 7>It's just chaos in the streets and I mean,</v>

1670
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 7>it's already chaos and most of the world in pockets,</v>

1671
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:03.364
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

1672
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 7>I think 2012 was in,</v>

1673
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:05.560
<v Speaker 7>it'd be prophecy side,</v>

1674
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.170
<v Speaker 7>I think 2012 and be a very interesting year.</v>

1675
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.290
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing that things have accelerated this far,</v>

1676
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 7>this close to 2012 when you look at it from a,</v>

1677
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.430
<v Speaker 7>the standpoint,</v>

1678
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 7>sure,</v>

1679
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.010
<v Speaker 7>everybody thinks well,</v>

1680
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 7>it's like the boy who cried wolf.</v>

1681
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 7>It's like at a certain point in time like y two K and this and that and you know</v>

1682
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:23.860
<v Speaker 7>the fucking Pleiades and where's Nibiru?</v>

1683
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:25.360
<v Speaker 7>And at a certain point in time like,</v>

1684
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.571
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>

1685
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:25.841
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

1686
00:49:25.841 --> 00:49:27.140
<v Speaker 7>well you're fucking apocalypse talk,</v>

1687
00:49:27.141 --> 00:49:27.974
<v Speaker 7>stop it.</v>

1688
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 7>But then as you get closer and closer to 2012 you're like,</v>

1689
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:32.104
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

1690
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:32.381
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1691
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:33.950
<v Speaker 7>maybe the Mayans were on assumption.</v>

1692
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:34.220
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1693
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.051
<v Speaker 7>I doubt that.</v>

1694
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:35.570
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>

1695
00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:35.740
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>

1696
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.550
<v Speaker 7>what does scare me is the self feeling shit.</v>

1697
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 7>And then people are gonna be jumping out of windows and shooting things up and</v>

1698
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:45.280
<v Speaker 7>all the ones that have convinced themselves if some diluted idea,</v>

1699
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 7>that's going to be very interesting.</v>

1700
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1701
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.010
<v Speaker 7>the other,</v>

1702
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:48.380
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1703
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 7>the other thing is like no one is saying it's going to be the end of the world.</v>

1704
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 7>It's just the end of this calendar could be a new era.</v>

1705
00:49:54.461 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 7>That's awesome.</v>

1706
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.410
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1707
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 7>it very easily could it,</v>

1708
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 7>my personal analysis,</v>

1709
00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 7>the end of the Mayan calendar is the end of the age of Pisces.</v>

1710
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.223
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

1711
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 7>That's the great year.</v>

1712
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 7>Starts again with the age of Aquarius is too hard to predict.</v>

1713
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 7>You have like a 1500 to 3000 year buffer.</v>

1714
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:12.220
<v Speaker 7>It's 2020 6,000 year cycle in the procession of the equinoxes.</v>

1715
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 7>And that's what I think it is.</v>

1716
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.040
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1717
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.491
<v Speaker 7>but whatever,</v>

1718
00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:16.680
<v Speaker 7>I don't pay attention to those things,</v>

1719
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.593
<v Speaker 7>but as far as,</v>

1720
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 7>I don't pay attention to it,</v>

1721
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 7>but I do pay attention to the fact that so many people pay attention to it.</v>

1722
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:23.561
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1723
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:24.010
<v Speaker 7>of course,</v>

1724
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.240
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1725
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.050
<v Speaker 7>I'm fascinated by astrology.</v>

1726
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if I,</v>

1727
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.441
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

1728
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 7>I'm a believer in it 100% but I think it's amazing that they can,</v>

1729
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1730
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 7>halfway nailed down personalities and different traits when they're really good</v>

1731
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:36.141
<v Speaker 7>at it.</v>

1732
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:37.310
<v Speaker 7>And we could argue on that one.</v>

1733
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 7>The power of suggestion is a,</v>

1734
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:41.450
<v Speaker 7>is quite phenomenal in the world today.</v>

1735
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:42.081
<v Speaker 7>You'd be amazed.</v>

1736
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:44.500
<v Speaker 7>And then as far as like structuring questions as far as structuring,</v>

1737
00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 7>leading people into,</v>

1738
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:46.251
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1739
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:46.911
<v Speaker 7>I've seen that.</v>

1740
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 7>I've seen like psychic stuff,</v>

1741
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 7>people do shit like that,</v>

1742
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not even talking about that.</v>

1743
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 7>I'm talking about like somebody giving you a date and some of those real</v>

1744
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:56.130
<v Speaker 7>astrologists they want to know like what time you were born.</v>

1745
00:50:56.131 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 7>And I don't know if it's real,</v>

1746
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.800
<v Speaker 7>but it's amazing that it's been around so long it,</v>

1747
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.160
<v Speaker 7>I do not know if it's real,</v>

1748
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 7>but it's amazing that at one point in time someone actually dedicated enough</v>

1749
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:09.911
<v Speaker 7>time to writing down some sort of a system to figure out which different things</v>

1750
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:12.930
<v Speaker 7>that are in line when you're born in the [inaudible].</v>

1751
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of amazing really.</v>

1752
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 7>I think it's beautiful.</v>

1753
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:16.910
<v Speaker 7>Beautiful from the standpoint,</v>

1754
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 7>a cultural standpoint to find your place in the universe.</v>

1755
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:19.791
<v Speaker 7>Think other people are doing,</v>

1756
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 7>they're looking at the sky,</v>

1757
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 7>it looks flat and two d they think about associations.</v>

1758
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 7>They want to feel like they're connected to it.</v>

1759
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 7>The whole definition of God,</v>

1760
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 7>and if you go back to my first film,</v>

1761
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.360
<v Speaker 7>most natural phenomenon,</v>

1762
00:51:29.361 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 7>stellar cults originated,</v>

1763
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.230
<v Speaker 7>merged into the Islam.</v>

1764
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.110
<v Speaker 7>Judeo Christian Islamic religion by symbolism just became his historize</v>

1765
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.993
<v Speaker 7>basically.</v>

1766
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:39.980
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

1767
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 7>the beauty of it is that people are trying to relate to something.</v>

1768
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.823
<v Speaker 7>That's what I see.</v>

1769
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.300
<v Speaker 7>But they still thought the sky was flat,</v>

1770
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:44.851
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1771
00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:46.340
<v Speaker 7>So the constellations don't even exist.</v>

1772
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 7>They don't actually know actually there.</v>

1773
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 7>They just looked that way.</v>

1774
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1775
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:50.601
<v Speaker 7>they thought,</v>

1776
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 7>who was,</v>

1777
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 7>they thought this guy was flat.</v>

1778
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.941
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1779
00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 7>if you look at the sky,</v>

1780
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 7>it looks perfectly flat and the constellations and the depictions are actually</v>

1781
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:57.320
<v Speaker 7>flat.</v>

1782
00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.153
<v Speaker 7>That's how they're important.</v>

1783
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.940
<v Speaker 7>That's why they have a little animal things and things like that.</v>

1784
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.300
<v Speaker 7>And the Sun rising.</v>

1785
00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 7>Let's say there's summer solstice,</v>

1786
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 7>I believe that's the birth note or most the spring equinox,</v>

1787
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:06.344
<v Speaker 7>you can't remember.</v>

1788
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.500
<v Speaker 7>It's a completely to Di Prima Fascia is surface flatland view and it doesn't</v>

1789
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 7>hold any actual validity because they had no idea that it was actually the</v>

1790
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:16.300
<v Speaker 7>depth.</v>

1791
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 7>You know the depth of the stars and their,</v>

1792
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 7>their radiants is so far away,</v>

1793
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 7>they're burning out there changing.</v>

1794
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:21.050
<v Speaker 7>There's morphine,</v>

1795
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:21.883
<v Speaker 7>there's expansion.</v>

1796
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

1797
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 7>so they just looked at it as like almost like a picture of flat two dimensional</v>

1798
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 7>picture stance is going to fall down.</v>

1799
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing that they did that for so long though.</v>

1800
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:34.010
<v Speaker 7>They really studied the constellations.</v>

1801
00:52:34.011 --> 00:52:35.570
<v Speaker 7>I guess that's a beautiful art form.</v>

1802
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 7>It's a beautiful concept</v>

1803
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:40.503
<v Speaker 6>that's outside.</v>

1804
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:41.670
<v Speaker 6>Where's that outside?</v>

1805
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 6>Who?</v>

1806
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:42.380
<v Speaker 6>Who,</v>

1807
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.710
<v Speaker 6>who's the mother beating?</v>

1808
00:52:43.711 --> 00:52:44.544
<v Speaker 6>Nice kid.</v>

1809
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.413
<v Speaker 6>Her Kid.</v>

1810
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.580
<v Speaker 6>Lovely Pasadena culture.</v>

1811
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 6>Well this is the only thing that's the worst you have to worry about Pasadena.</v>

1812
00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.330
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1813
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:52.163
<v Speaker 6>this is not like,</v>

1814
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.390
<v Speaker 6>you know what's funny is jungles of Africa.</v>

1815
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.480
<v Speaker 6>I know this girl that I was a stripper a long time ago and she found out about</v>

1816
00:52:59.731 --> 00:53:02.130
<v Speaker 6>you from the green room of a strip club.</v>

1817
00:53:02.131 --> 00:53:04.770
<v Speaker 6>There was a hairdryer hair designer that was,</v>

1818
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.080
<v Speaker 6>he was a gay guy that was in love with your shit.</v>

1819
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:11.010
<v Speaker 6>And so he used to tag you throughout San Francisco and in this green room of a</v>

1820
00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 6>strip club,</v>

1821
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:12.191
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

1822
00:53:12.191 --> 00:53:13.250
<v Speaker 6>your tag is all over.</v>

1823
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.000
<v Speaker 6>He just tagged the fuck out of this green room.</v>

1824
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.600
<v Speaker 6>That's how she found out about it.</v>

1825
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:21.570
<v Speaker 6>And then she got so moved by your movie that she started posting flyers around</v>

1826
00:53:21.571 --> 00:53:22.500
<v Speaker 6>San Francisco,</v>

1827
00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:22.951
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1828
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 6>to promote your movie because she was so moved by her.</v>

1829
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 6>That</v>

1830
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.710
<v Speaker 5>was what it was so phenomenal on the,</v>

1831
00:53:27.711 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1832
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:28.703
<v Speaker 5>the original owner.</v>

1833
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 5>It still persists to this day on its own.</v>

1834
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 5>I did know publicity for any of these things.</v>

1835
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 5>It's always been self driven.</v>

1836
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:34.501
<v Speaker 5>It somehow,</v>

1837
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 5>it seemed to tap into some element of people that they appreciate it and felt</v>

1838
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 5>the need to re communicate to other people,</v>

1839
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.110
<v Speaker 5>which is inadvertent to me.</v>

1840
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 5>I certainly didn't anticipate that,</v>

1841
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1842
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.211
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1843
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 5>it blown your mind.</v>

1844
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:46.501
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1845
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:46.980
<v Speaker 5>I get these,</v>

1846
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.930
<v Speaker 5>I get these marketing calls occasionally or emails from these marketing jackass</v>

1847
00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:51.151
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>

1848
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:51.984
<v Speaker 5>how did you do that?</v>

1849
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 5>What kind of,</v>

1850
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 5>what kind of algorithms are you using in your viral media?</v>

1851
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 5>Like it's just word of mouth,</v>

1852
00:53:56.761 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1853
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

1854
00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1855
00:53:59.040 --> 00:53:59.671
<v Speaker 5>Highly envy.</v>

1856
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 5>The film series is a highly envied by a lot of people.</v>

1857
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:02.490
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to,</v>

1858
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of films trying to duplicate the idea to duplicate the concept and</v>

1859
00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:08.860
<v Speaker 5>build kind of a farce community out of it.</v>

1860
00:54:08.861 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 5>And the same way that was natural to the movement.</v>

1861
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:11.551
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1862
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

1863
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.893
<v Speaker 5>what do you expect?</v>

1864
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

1865
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Everyone assumes dollar signs and there's a lot of people around.</v>

1866
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1867
00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:17.500
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1868
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Well there's um,</v>

1869
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:23.530
<v Speaker 1>there's always been someone at the helm of something at different points in</v>

1870
00:54:24.141 --> 00:54:24.501
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1871
00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:24.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1872
00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:25.550
<v Speaker 1>different cultures,</v>

1873
00:54:25.551 --> 00:54:26.361
<v Speaker 1>different religions,</v>

1874
00:54:26.361 --> 00:54:27.080
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1875
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1876
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.861
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1877
00:54:27.861 --> 00:54:30.860
<v Speaker 1>different kingdoms has always been someone with a new idea.</v>

1878
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think everybody's sort of recognizes that this thing is falling apart.</v>

1879
00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:36.910
<v Speaker 1>No one's buying anymore.</v>

1880
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:38.840
<v Speaker 1>And a new things going to come along,</v>

1881
00:54:38.841 --> 00:54:39.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1882
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And we've got to jump on it.</v>

1883
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.170
<v Speaker 1>We're going to jump on it because this is,</v>

1884
00:54:42.171 --> 00:54:43.670
<v Speaker 1>this really is the future because this,</v>

1885
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:45.710
<v Speaker 1>this dying animal that you see this,</v>

1886
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:49.190
<v Speaker 1>this fucking elephant and donkey system is stupid.</v>

1887
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:49.911
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

1888
00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And everybody recognizes it's destroying us.</v>

1889
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:52.791
<v Speaker 5>Just look around.</v>

1890
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:56.210
<v Speaker 5>It's destroying the fabric of almost everything that you see around you.</v>

1891
00:54:56.211 --> 00:54:58.340
<v Speaker 5>You have every life support systems in decline.</v>

1892
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.890
<v Speaker 5>Our psychology is really fucked up.</v>

1893
00:55:00.891 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 5>And if he's taken a look around what coach was doing today,</v>

1894
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean the public health issue is bad enough.</v>

1895
00:55:04.611 --> 00:55:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm just waiting for the tipping point where,</v>

1896
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:07.394
<v Speaker 5>where uh,</v>

1897
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.250
<v Speaker 5>the lifespan starts to tip cause I think it's just a matter of time.</v>

1898
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend that has a 10 year old and she has her 10 year is in school and</v>

1899
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:15.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1900
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:15.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1901
00:55:15.561 --> 00:55:19.850
<v Speaker 1>he's an active kid and the psychologist or psychiatrist,</v>

1902
00:55:19.851 --> 00:55:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be for school,</v>

1903
00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.870
<v Speaker 1>is trying to give the kid trucks and he says,</v>

1904
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.250
<v Speaker 1>well he's a good kid.</v>

1905
00:55:25.251 --> 00:55:25.880
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

1906
00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.510
<v Speaker 1>he's not a,</v>

1907
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:30.140
<v Speaker 1>he just gets bored in class and he acts up a little bit but he doesn't need to</v>

1908
00:55:30.141 --> 00:55:30.974
<v Speaker 1>be drugged.</v>

1909
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:31.551
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1910
00:55:31.551 --> 00:55:32.301
<v Speaker 1>you're so easy.</v>

1911
00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>You're so quick to drug them.</v>

1912
00:55:33.711 --> 00:55:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Like how many kids in his classes are,</v>

1913
00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:36.291
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1914
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:36.561
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1915
00:55:36.561 --> 00:55:37.430
<v Speaker 1>are on drugs.</v>

1916
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.061
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

1917
00:55:38.061 --> 00:55:41.960
<v Speaker 1>well I am not an liberty to give that it's confidential information,</v>

1918
00:55:41.961 --> 00:55:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but let me tell you it's somewhere near half.</v>

1919
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.280
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why the fuck he would say that.</v>

1920
00:55:46.281 --> 00:55:47.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not at liberty.</v>

1921
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:48.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1922
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.921
<v Speaker 1>and then she goes,</v>

1923
00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:49.371
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1924
00:55:49.371 --> 00:55:51.050
<v Speaker 1>a half,</v>

1925
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:51.200
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

1926
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you know you think half of the kids in school have a mental problem to the</v>

1927
00:55:55.461 --> 00:55:56.960
<v Speaker 1>point where they need drugs?</v>

1928
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1929
00:55:58.610 --> 00:55:59.750
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1930
00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.350
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing that there's someone out there that is a professional that's</v>

1931
00:56:03.351 --> 00:56:04.430
<v Speaker 1>able to do something like that.</v>

1932
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a woman telling me about her child.</v>

1933
00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I do not know for numbers were correct.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1935
00:56:09.471 --> 00:56:09.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean she,</v>

1936
00:56:09.861 --> 00:56:10.700
<v Speaker 1>she might've just,</v>

1937
00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't see she's adding marijuana on a dummy though.</v>

1938
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:14.960
<v Speaker 1>She's not a dummy,</v>

1941
00:56:15.681 --> 00:56:18.500
<v Speaker 1>she was telling me this and it made a whole lot of sense to me and I was like,</v>

1942
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:20.630
<v Speaker 1>that is amazing that they're just,</v>

1943
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 1>they're so willing to drug people and that's a of sickness.</v>

1944
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.510

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why you kids moving around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1952
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:33.281
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1953
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's getting all this input that blows and he knows he can get out of that</v>

1954
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:40.940
<v Speaker 1>class and play video games and have laughs with his friends and,</v>

00:56:40.941 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 1>and say hi to girls.</v>

1956
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And that would be awesome,</v>

1957
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but right now this sucks and it just,</v>

00:56:45.491 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't take the suck any longer.</v>

1959
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:47.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1960
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're telling me that the only way to learn is to be board into a</v>

1961
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:56.251
<v Speaker 1>fucking coma and just accept this really low frequency of memorizing shit that</v>

1962
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 1>some other asshole figured out and so that's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1965
00:56:59.211 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what school is every day.</v>

1966
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Just pounding it into you that the only way to get through this is you're going</v>

1967

<v Speaker 1>to have to hate it when meanwhile everything else you get good at every game you</v>

1980
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything else that you get good at,</v>

1981
00:57:23.261 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it's fun except the shit that you have to deal with in school.</v>

1982
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Unmotivated people,</v>

1983
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:32.410
<v Speaker 1>they're underpaid and you want to talk about like the symptom of a sick society.</v>

1984
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.830
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we put so little emphasis on schools,</v>

1985
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>so little emphasis on teaching.</v>

1986
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 1>It should be an honor</v>

1987
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 1>fields from the plant to let guard over people's children.</v>

1988
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:46.511
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1989
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you should be the most honorable,</v>

1990
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 1>respectable people available.</v>

1991
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Super Intelligent and super well paid.</v>

1992
00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:55.480
<v Speaker 1>We should be paying teachers fuckloads of money,</v>

1993
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:55.841
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1994
00:57:55.841 --> 00:57:56.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1995
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:56.974
<v Speaker 1>they should be,</v>

1996
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it should be like a prestigious position.</v>

1997
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It should be something that you like really aspire to instead of something where</v>

1998
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:04.031
<v Speaker 1>it's a passion,</v>

1999
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting fucked by the system.</v>

2000
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:05.771
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2001
00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you barely have enough money to eat.</v>

2002
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:07.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2003
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you look at how much a teacher makes in a public school system,</v>

2004
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:12.430
<v Speaker 1>it's it fucking deplorable.</v>

2005
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that it's accepted.</v>

2006
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like for whatever reason,</v>

2007
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 1>we don't step out of boundaries and,</v>

2008
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>and look at it objectively and go,</v>

2009
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>we've got some core problems and a big part of it is our children and they</v>

2010
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 1>developed to become shitty fucking human beings against their own intentions.</v>

2011
00:58:28.421 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they want to suck out.</v>

2012
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.970
<v Speaker 1>The kids don't want to suck his,</v>

2013
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:34.300
<v Speaker 1>his are just balls of potential</v>

2014
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.070
<v Speaker 5>victims.</v>

2015
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:37.110
<v Speaker 5>The victims of a system that really doesn't care.</v>

2016
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.963
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't understand,</v>

2017
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't put any resources towards it.</v>

2018
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have so much money to go to war and you have so little to go to</v>

2019
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:44.530
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2020
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.311
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2021
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2022
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that you've worked out the numbers that way.</v>

2023
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 5>What level of a imposition you can have is to go to college,</v>

2024
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:53.080
<v Speaker 5>get $80,000 worth of debt and then guess what?</v>

2025
00:58:53.081 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 5>You ripe to be enslaved and some hideous corporate estate</v>

2026
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you just hoping you can afford a Lexus next year.</v>

2027
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2028
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.550
<v Speaker 1>every day just live in a slave.</v>

2029
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.010
<v Speaker 5>But back to the drug issue just preps kids now so they can,</v>

2030
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 5>when they get to be adults and try to figure out why they're so miserable,</v>

2031
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 5>why they hate their job,</v>

2032
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 5>while they have no contribution to society,</v>

2033
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 5>why they don't have any artistic energy anymore.</v>

2034
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 5>Well that's perfect cause then you can give them the PROZAC and give them all</v>

2035
00:59:17.531 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 5>the other drugs that will nullify them to make them adhere to this process.</v>

2036
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2037
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 7>Poor little guys.</v>

2038
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 7>So if you analyze all that and use statistical view,</v>

2039
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.090
<v Speaker 7>public health from a psychological and mental health standpoint,</v>

2040
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.140
<v Speaker 7>you look at depression rates,</v>

2041
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:32.901
<v Speaker 7>you look at everything.</v>

2042
00:59:32.901 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 7>Then you look at the environmental problems you look at,</v>

2043
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 7>you just go straight down the spectrum of public health to physical health too,</v>

2044
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:40.580
<v Speaker 7>to environmental health.</v>

2045
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 7>You have one massive drop off.</v>

2046
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 7>It's ridiculous,</v>

2047
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:45.401
<v Speaker 7>and that's,</v>

2048
00:59:45.401 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 7>that's the data idea with far too often,</v>

2049
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 7>and that's why I think the system can hold up for that much longer.</v>

2050
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:50.781
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2051
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 7>the cancer rates are out of control for one.</v>

2052
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 7>As a general rule,</v>

2053
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.630
<v Speaker 7>there's more cancer occurring now than ever before.</v>

2054
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 7>There's too many of us.</v>

2055
00:59:58.550 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2056
00:59:59.240 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2057
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 7>it's not too many of us know.</v>

2058
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.861
<v Speaker 7>Nope.</v>

2059
01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:01.641
<v Speaker 7>I don't agree with that at all.</v>

2060
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:01.860
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

2061
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 7>that's some people intuitively speaking,</v>

2062
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 7>you'd want to say that.</v>

2063
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:06.560
<v Speaker 7>I think the board can hold many,</v>

2064
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 7>many more times the number of people if it was properly structured,</v>

2065
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 7>but we have to also deal with something different as far as like fuel,</v>

2066
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2067
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 7>We can't be,</v>

2068
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 7>we can't be a carbon</v>

2069
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 7>fossil fuel base.</v>

2070
01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 7>Not Great.</v>

2071
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Speaker 7>Paradigm shift is we've been living off of fossil deposits,</v>

2072
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 7>which is one of those ignorant things possible.</v>

2073
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 7>Since we're surrounded by the movement of energy from the Sun,</v>

2074
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.310
<v Speaker 7>new everything else,</v>

2075
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.211
<v Speaker 7>we have these,</v>

2076
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:30.044
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2077
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:30.321
<v Speaker 7>we've,</v>

2078
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:30.860
<v Speaker 7>we've,</v>

2079
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 7>there's no crisis in the energy.</v>

2080
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:33.370
<v Speaker 7>There's no energy problem.</v>

2081
01:00:33.371 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 7>There's only the crisis of ignorance as I stated before.</v>

2082
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 7>And that's really the big thing.</v>

2083
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 7>We have plenty of energy.</v>

2084
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.891
<v Speaker 7>So you think,</v>

2085
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2086
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:40.451
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2087
01:00:40.451 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 7>ideally,</v>

2088
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:42.980
<v Speaker 7>especially in southern California,</v>

2089
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 7>we should have like solar domes,</v>

2090
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:45.610
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2091
01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:46.071
<v Speaker 7>It should be like,</v>

2092
01:00:46.071 --> 01:00:47.540
<v Speaker 7>should be solar.</v>

2093
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:48.000
<v Speaker 7>They're there.</v>

2094
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.440
<v Speaker 7>Well you should.</v>

2095
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:48.681
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2096
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:49.491
<v Speaker 7>if you really want to hear it too,</v>

2097
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:49.591
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2098
01:00:49.591 --> 01:00:50.870
<v Speaker 7>you should hovering in the sky,</v>

2099
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.733
<v Speaker 7>all solar,</v>

2100
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.341
<v Speaker 7>you just go with it.</v>

2101
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:52.941
<v Speaker 7>You go local,</v>

2102
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 7>you take this block which has plenty of sun exposure and you apply for the forte</v>

2103
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 7>paints and high,</v>

2104
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.280
<v Speaker 7>high quality advancements and does not,</v>

2105
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 7>it does very little money going into the research.</v>

2106
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.103
<v Speaker 7>By the way.</v>

2107
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.430
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to get any kind of funding for those things.</v>

2108
01:01:05.431 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 7>So if you imagine how fast we could advance with these renewable mediums</v>

2109
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.700
<v Speaker 7>localized,</v>

2110
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:13.220
<v Speaker 7>if we actually put the energy into them,</v>

2111
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 7>you can do the extrapolation on how far we'd become cause technology just</v>

2112
01:01:16.401 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 7>continues to move beyond our expectations.</v>

2113
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 7>Don't you need batteries though?</v>

2114
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:20.864
<v Speaker 7>For Solar?</v>

2115
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.840
<v Speaker 7>Between super capacitors and and hydrogen,</v>

2116
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 7>which is the new idea.</v>

2117
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 7>You could store it at these things for easily overcome the intermittency of</v>

2118
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:30.050
<v Speaker 7>solar easily through battery technology.</v>

2119
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:31.160
<v Speaker 7>The problem with battery technology,</v>

2120
01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:31.341
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

2121
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:32.001
<v Speaker 7>in the market system,</v>

2122
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 7>you want constant turnover.</v>

2123
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:33.734
<v Speaker 7>You want scarcity,</v>

2124
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.160
<v Speaker 7>you want people to go back and buy more batteries because that's what this</v>

2125
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 7>entire system and also the problem minerals to create the batteries like lithium</v>

2126
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 7>ion and they get to go for hydrogen.</v>

2127
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.030
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>

2128
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:48.620
<v Speaker 7>now I think hydrogen batteries or hydrogen storage storage.</v>

2129
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 7>So this would not be a solar issue then because you can't,</v>

2130
01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 7>usually you bring the solar into it,</v>

2131
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.630
<v Speaker 7>you bring solar power and then you convert that into hydrogen.</v>

2132
01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:56.860
<v Speaker 7>Somehow it's stored.</v>

2133
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.860
<v Speaker 7>It's stored in the water,</v>

2134
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 7>stored in the hydrogen.</v>

2135
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 7>How's that?</v>

2136
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 7>That's a new technology that's been internal.</v>

2137
01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 7>So no need for batteries,</v>

2138
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.310
<v Speaker 7>no needs for better my on nothing,</v>

2139
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 7>no need for the minerals that they get in the car.</v>

2140
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:12.120
<v Speaker 7>You might have to have some lithium ion in intermittent sense dependent on how</v>

2141
01:02:12.121 --> 01:02:14.480
<v Speaker 7>the battery is constructed or but super capacitors,</v>

2142
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 7>which is another concept which isn't utilized.</v>

2143
01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 7>You know how you like your computer as capacitors,</v>

2144
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.034
<v Speaker 7>that store energy,</v>

2145
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 7>a very different technology</v>

2146
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 5>than the standard battery,</v>

2147
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of like a,</v>

2148
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.010
<v Speaker 5>you fill it in there.</v>

2149
01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 5>There's many different forms and there's a great deal of advancement there and</v>

2150
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 5>there's really nothing that I can find that would inhibit storage for an</v>

2151
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:33.960
<v Speaker 5>admitted NSI from solar.</v>

2152
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 5>If you really put your mind to it.</v>

2153
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 5>There's to say that would take some more deep analysis,</v>

2154
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 5>but I can't imagine we'd run out of minerals just for that.</v>

2155
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:41.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2156
01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2157
01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>it's always been ironic to me that the,</v>

2158
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2159
01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>the chain from minerals coming out of the ground to the super advanced</v>

2160
01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:50.224
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2161
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>just such a barbaric chain,</v>

2162
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>and they look down at the people in no shoes with pick axes,</v>

2163
01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>pulling the minerals out of the ground,</v>

2164
01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>the Congo and how that eventually gets to your apple laptop.</v>

2165
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2166
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:01.241
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2167
01:03:01.241 --> 01:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fascinating that,</v>

2168
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>that that is all,</v>

2169
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that's a part of the equation.</v>

2170
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>The part of the equation for high technology,</v>

2171
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 1>whether it's solar power,</v>

2172
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>anything is you need the minerals from Africa of course,</v>

2173
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's how they're extracting those fucking things</v>

2174
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:14.081
<v Speaker 5>and tell him.</v>

2175
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:17.240
<v Speaker 5>Molecular engineering comes into play and we've begin to synthesize these,</v>

2176
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.210
<v Speaker 5>these raw materials from scratch through molecular engineering,</v>

2177
01:03:20.211 --> 01:03:23.330
<v Speaker 5>which is around the corner probably within the next 50 60 years.</v>

2178
01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:24.860
<v Speaker 5>It's already small advancements in that.</v>

2179
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:25.491
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2180
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:26.680
<v Speaker 5>the more you just liked,</v>

2181
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.010
<v Speaker 5>that's alchemy.</v>

2182
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:29.620
<v Speaker 5>It is kind of kind of,</v>

2183
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2184
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.713
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2185
01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.840
<v Speaker 5>That's what people had predicted.</v>

2186
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:33.471
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2187
01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:35.630
<v Speaker 5>you remember probably the old many years ago,</v>

2188
01:03:35.631 --> 01:03:36.560
<v Speaker 5>it was one of the companies,</v>

2189
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:40.400
<v Speaker 5>they spelled their name and little Adams and they showed it in the magnifying</v>

2190
01:03:40.401 --> 01:03:41.390
<v Speaker 5>glass at big feet.</v>

2191
01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:45.890
<v Speaker 5>We've come a long way since then and there's a lot of great futurist ideas out</v>

2192
01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:49.520
<v Speaker 5>there that can basically create replicators for your home where you're not going</v>

2193
01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:51.830
<v Speaker 5>to be like me going to a store to buy anything.</v>

2194
01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:54.050
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be creating these things in your home.</v>

2195
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:56.960
<v Speaker 5>And if there's anything that will destroy the market system quite rapidly,</v>

2196
01:03:56.961 --> 01:03:58.100
<v Speaker 5>it will be advancements like that.</v>

2197
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 5>How do you possibly maintain labor systems where you can synthesize a laptop in</v>

2198
01:04:02.451 --> 01:04:03.200
<v Speaker 5>one swoop,</v>

2199
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.760
<v Speaker 5>download the model from your computer,</v>

2200
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.020
<v Speaker 5>it goes into this vat,</v>

2201
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:06.873
<v Speaker 5>it's in this,</v>

2202
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.670
<v Speaker 5>this dust,</v>

2203
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 5>and then the Milan molecular element is released just like you print into a</v>

2204
01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:12.620
<v Speaker 5>printer or three d printing,</v>

2205
01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:15.650
<v Speaker 5>which I had in my feel moving forward as a primitive notion of that they can</v>

2206
01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.450
<v Speaker 5>print for cars now in one swoop.</v>

2207
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:21.860
<v Speaker 5>There's so much advanced technology out there that is not known that would solve</v>

2208
01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.240
<v Speaker 5>so many problems.</v>

2209
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.870
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2210
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:24.703
<v Speaker 5>it's frustrating.</v>

2211
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.580
<v Speaker 5>It's very frustrating.</v>

2212
01:04:25.581 --> 01:04:30.320
<v Speaker 5>And the very fact that these efficiencies are there and not being pushed as fast</v>

2213
01:04:30.321 --> 01:04:30.911
<v Speaker 5>as they should be,</v>

2214
01:04:30.911 --> 01:04:31.910
<v Speaker 5>as even more frustrating.</v>

2215
01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.080
<v Speaker 5>But you see why?</v>

2216
01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:33.441
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2217
01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Because efficiency is the enemy of everything that turns a profit that we want.</v>

2218
01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:38.510
<v Speaker 5>We want to serve this everything.</v>

2219
01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:39.590
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to solve problems.</v>

2220
01:04:39.591 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 5>We want people with cancer not to cure the cancer we want.</v>

2221
01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>That's an ethic though that they think about that.</v>

2222
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:45.160
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2223
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.300
<v Speaker 5>it's subconscious.</v>

2224
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 5>It's syntax of thought.</v>

2225
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.190
<v Speaker 5>They don't necessarily think that way.</v>

2226
01:04:50.191 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Just like guys sitting around a room and the Pentagon start to justify killing</v>

2227
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:55.080
<v Speaker 5>3000 people.</v>

2228
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 5>They're not thinking in terms of being murderers or anything else.</v>

2229
01:04:58.081 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 5>They're thinking in terms of business.</v>

2230
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.430
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2231
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.870
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2232
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.180
<v Speaker 5>if you want to make a laptop and you want people to buy it again,</v>

2233
01:05:03.181 --> 01:05:06.120
<v Speaker 5>that things die probably three years from the time you buy it in different</v>

2234
01:05:06.121 --> 01:05:07.190
<v Speaker 5>component problems that will go on.</v>

2235
01:05:07.191 --> 01:05:08.340
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean it has to know,</v>

2236
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 5>but the turnover is so important.</v>

2237
01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.170
<v Speaker 5>Efficient efficiency is the driver of this system,</v>

2238
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.970
<v Speaker 5>which is why we had the pollution problems,</v>

2239
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:16.590
<v Speaker 5>the waste problems and the health problems.</v>

2240
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 5>And why did they feed in together and while you are whole GDP is literally</v>

2241
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:24.130
<v Speaker 5>driven by sickness and inefficiency and waste.</v>

2242
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.440
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

2243
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 5>if there's anything that blows my mind,</v>

2244
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 5>it's how anti economic,</v>

2245
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:31.600
<v Speaker 5>our current system really is on all levels.</v>

2246
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 5>So if you want to solve problems,</v>

2247
01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 5>you want to make a car that lasts 60 years,</v>

2248
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 5>that's easily interchangeable.</v>

2249
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 5>That can be,</v>

2250
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:36.851
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

2251
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:37.241
<v Speaker 5>more than that.</v>

2252
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:38.074
<v Speaker 5>Bailey a hundred years,</v>

2253
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:38.891
<v Speaker 5>easily interchangeable.</v>

2254
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.724
<v Speaker 5>They can be updated.</v>

2255
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 5>You want to make a smart phone that has the longest lasting components.</v>

2256
01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 5>They don't need to throw away.</v>

2257
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 5>These things could be done if we wanted to do it,</v>

2258
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 5>but the be the be an enema to what the market system requires for constant</v>

2259
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 5>turnover,</v>

2260
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 5>constant turnover,</v>

2261
01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.591
<v Speaker 5>constant money.</v>

2262
01:05:51.591 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 5>Circulation means more jobs.</v>

2263
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 5>So it's planned obsolescence you think?</v>

2264
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Is this like a business model?</v>

2265
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.630
<v Speaker 5>It's planned and intrinsic.</v>

2266
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.400
<v Speaker 5>Another level level is in transactions that people,</v>

2267
01:06:01.401 --> 01:06:01.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2268
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:03.730
<v Speaker 5>they build things the best they can and they don't last.</v>

2269
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 5>They just break two levels to it.</v>

2270
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Speaker 5>Planned obsolescence is very real.</v>

2271
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 5>You can go into historical archives of car companies to know that they</v>

2272
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:10.560
<v Speaker 5>strategize.</v>

2273
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 5>I can guarantee you the people behind apple sit there and their rooms and they</v>

2274
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 5>had full on statistics kind of operating systems.</v>

2275
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh you have an operating system update the software,</v>

2276
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.620
<v Speaker 5>the software scan is even worse cause that's just numb ones and Zeros.</v>

2277
01:06:23.621 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 5>The fact that they even charge over and over for that more hilarious.</v>

2278
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 5>That's planned obsolescence.</v>

2279
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 5>Intrinsic obsolescence is even more fucked up if you think about it.</v>

2280
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:35.830
<v Speaker 5>That computer for it to be built has to go through the engine of the industrial</v>

2281
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:36.700
<v Speaker 5>profit complex,</v>

2282
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.870
<v Speaker 5>which means all the components,</v>

2283
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:38.771
<v Speaker 5>the extraction,</v>

2284
01:06:38.771 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 5>everything else someone's taking off the top throughout the entire thing.</v>

2285
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2286
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 5>And there's cost efficiency at the very end.</v>

2287
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 5>So if you're apple computer,</v>

2288
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 5>you bought a by the components to make your computer.</v>

2289
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 5>You can't buy necessarily the highest grade level stuff in order to remain</v>

2290
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 5>competitive against the other people that are selling computers similar like</v>

2291
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.640
<v Speaker 5>windows or whatever.</v>

2292
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 5>So you have to constantly be a little bit behind in order to be competitive so</v>

2293
01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 5>you can drop the price.</v>

2294
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.731
<v Speaker 5>But there was,</v>

2295
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 5>the quality of the product has to be diminished immediately for people to afford</v>

2296
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2297
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.250
<v Speaker 5>The equation of,</v>

2298
01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 5>of cost efficiency refuses to allow the best possible goods to be produced at</v>

2299
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.810
<v Speaker 5>any one time period.</v>

2300
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:17.644
<v Speaker 5>It's a rule.</v>

2301
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a natural evolution,</v>

2302
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 5>natural and natural dynamic,</v>

2303
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:21.970
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

2304
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.940
<v Speaker 5>of what it means to save money and to make profit.</v>

2305
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 5>So everything's a piece of shit the moment it's produced.</v>

2306
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:30.270
<v Speaker 5>Well that's separate.</v>

2308
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.780
<v Speaker 5>The shit like Ferrari's.</v>

2309
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Even a Ferrari though.</v>

2310
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.480
<v Speaker 5>Think about the price of a Ferrari though.</v>

2311
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's so expensive part.</v>

2312
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean they really make the best shit they can,</v>

2313
01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:40.840
<v Speaker 5>but it's not really the best.</v>

2314
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.531
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck yeah,</v>

2315
01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:42.940
<v Speaker 5>it is four or five,</v>

2316
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:43.571
<v Speaker 5>eight Italia.</v>

2317
01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:44.404
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that thing?</v>

2318
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Twin clutch gearbox,</v>

2319
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 5>ridiculously powered VA mid engine.</v>

2320
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Supercar come on man.</v>

2321
01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:52.840
<v Speaker 5>That's about as good as human beings have ever created.</v>

2322
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.101
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>

2323
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:54.221
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2324
01:07:54.221 --> 01:07:54.581
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

2325
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:55.840
<v Speaker 5>the peak of engineering,</v>

2326
01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 5>the there,</v>

2327
01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:56.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2328
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 5>they use race car driving to,</v>

2329
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:00.190
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2330
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 5>to engineer their cars.</v>

2331
01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:05.770
<v Speaker 5>They push cars to the limit and every year they go around the Newburg ring like</v>

2332
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:08.290
<v Speaker 5>a couple of seconds faster and everybody's like straining for like the new</v>

2333
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Porsche is a seven minutes and 40 seconds.</v>

2334
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 5>The new nine 11 and that's like this is an electric,</v>

2335
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.781
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2336
01:08:13.781 --> 01:08:14.471
<v Speaker 5>it's not electric,</v>

2337
01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:15.140
<v Speaker 5>but they have,</v>

2338
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 5>they have cars that they</v>

2339
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.470
<v Speaker 2>have developed that are electric.</v>

2340
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Porsche has a,</v>

2341
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:19.611
<v Speaker 2>they had a um,</v>

2342
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 2>a gt three cup car that they raced in the 24 hour race that was a,</v>

2343
01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 2>that was an electric car.</v>

2344
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 2>They're definitely trying to come up with electrical technology,</v>

2345
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but they're are making the best cars they can make.</v>

2346
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:31.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2347
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:32.211
<v Speaker 2>let's define,</v>

2348
01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>get to like there's certain things that are being done right now.</v>

2349
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 2>They're at the peak of production.</v>

2350
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Even though they are being produced,</v>

2351
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>they're essentially making like some high end shit that's the best they can</v>

2352
01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:43.784
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

2353
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.400
<v Speaker 5>We could probably argue that one because if you look at all the advanced</v>

2354
01:08:47.401 --> 01:08:49.530
<v Speaker 5>propulsion technology that's used in NASA,</v>

2355
01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.630
<v Speaker 5>why aren't they applying such things like that?</v>

2356
01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:53.820
<v Speaker 5>You can try to thought not exactly,</v>

2357
01:08:53.821 --> 01:08:56.850
<v Speaker 5>but there are all sorts of things that could be that are probably more advanced</v>

2358
01:08:56.851 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 5>than either of us,</v>

2359
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.830
<v Speaker 5>either of us know that could be applied to that Ferrari but they're not because</v>

2360
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.120
<v Speaker 5>I actually sense of therefore no one will be able to anyway</v>

2361
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.730
<v Speaker 2>gas that you could get a pump either you have to work within no skin strains</v>

2362
01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>cause our gas is actually really low compared to a,</v>

2363
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.480
<v Speaker 2>like our octane's late [inaudible] 91 in other parts of the country.</v>

2364
01:09:13.481 --> 01:09:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I know you can get like 93 or four.</v>

2365
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2366
01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it's bad to have more octane.</v>

2367
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 5>But you see my point though,</v>

2368
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 5>you can't make something really that people can buy it.</v>

2369
01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 5>But I see what you're saying.</v>

2370
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.910
<v Speaker 5>Demograph heart.</v>

2371
01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.650
<v Speaker 5>It's demographic targeted too.</v>

2372
01:09:25.651 --> 01:09:26.970
<v Speaker 5>So what's the majority,</v>

2373
01:09:26.971 --> 01:09:28.230
<v Speaker 5>what are the majority of people?</v>

2374
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.300
<v Speaker 5>Majority of people are lower and middle class.</v>

2375
01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.960
<v Speaker 5>You make shit that doesn't work very well so they can afford it and invariably</v>

2376
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.660
<v Speaker 5>it breaks and they suffer in the end because they have to deal with the constant</v>

2377
01:09:36.661 --> 01:09:40.470
<v Speaker 5>cyclical turnover and the need to constantly repair and everything else.</v>

2378
01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:44.910
<v Speaker 2>When everything hits the fan and you start your calls,</v>

2379
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:46.140
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2380
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.150
<v Speaker 2>what will everyone do for a job?</v>

2381
01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>How does everyone get?</v>

2382
01:09:49.261 --> 01:09:50.340
<v Speaker 2>You'll be doing my laundry.</v>

2383
01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll be doing your laundry.</v>

2384
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at laundry done and you're not going to want me to do your laundry,</v>

2385
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:55.374
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2386
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2387
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.080
<v Speaker 2>what did she do?</v>

2388
01:09:58.290 --> 01:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>What does everybody get a job?</v>

2389
01:09:59.971 --> 01:10:00.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2390
01:10:00.211 --> 01:10:00.751
<v Speaker 2>what does it become?</v>

2391
01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Communism.</v>

2392
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2393
01:10:01.591 --> 01:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>how do you figure out what the fuck everybody does to contribute to this thing?</v>

2394
01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:05.071
<v Speaker 2>What if you,</v>

2395
01:10:05.071 --> 01:10:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what if you're a lazy cunt,</v>

2396
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>how do we deal with Lacey,</v>

2397
01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:08.420
<v Speaker 2>consonant</v>

2398
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 5>number,</v>

2399
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 5>that lazy concert victims of culture,</v>

2400
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2401
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2402
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.250
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2403
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 5>that's the threshold here is where do we take them on mushroom trips and</v>

2404
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 5>straighten them out who we do?</v>

2405
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2406
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:18.441
<v Speaker 5>think about it this way.</v>

2407
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 5>If you had a kid go into a store and they,</v>

2408
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.060
<v Speaker 5>there's a kid in his mother and the kid,</v>

2409
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:27.170
<v Speaker 5>it's today and the kid goes and grabs some stuff and shoves it in his pockets.</v>

2410
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:27.651
<v Speaker 5>The mom says,</v>

2411
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:27.861
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2412
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:29.780
<v Speaker 5>that's stealing slaps the kid's hand.</v>

2413
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 5>The kid learns a valuable lesson in his values are altered,</v>

2414
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:33.164
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2415
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Think about the same type of idea where we go into a store,</v>

2416
01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:36.963
<v Speaker 5>there's no money.</v>

2417
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.150
<v Speaker 5>It's not even a store.</v>

2418
01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:38.600
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2419
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a supply house.</v>

2420
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.970
<v Speaker 5>And a kid goes in and grabs whole handfuls of shit that is completely</v>

2421
01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary because there's no utility for it.</v>

2422
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:47.421
<v Speaker 5>And the mother says,</v>

2423
01:10:47.421 --> 01:10:47.661
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2424
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 5>that's not what we do because we don't need all of that.</v>

2425
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 5>It has to be there and we'll come back and get it later as we need it because</v>

2426
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 5>the systems that efficient.</v>

2427
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 5>So you see how the value programming is very easy to adapt.</v>

2428
01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 5>So throughout time you'd begin to change people's values,</v>

2429
01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:02.600
<v Speaker 5>how they relate to their environment.</v>

2430
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.370
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you didn't have to worry about money,</v>

2431
01:11:04.371 --> 01:11:05.204
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

2432
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:09.710
<v Speaker 5>imagine the extent that you could pursue in your life the interest that you</v>

2433
01:11:09.711 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 5>found interesting.</v>

2434
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.860
<v Speaker 5>And invariably I guarantee you,</v>

2435
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 5>if you look</v>

2436
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 7>at how people respond,</v>

2437
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 7>especially in their later years when they get more introspective,</v>

2438
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 7>everyone wants to feel like they're contributing to society.</v>

2439
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.890
<v Speaker 7>Everyone wants to feel like they've done something social,</v>

2440
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 7>so that kind of greed,</v>

2441
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.140
<v Speaker 7>self absorbed share,</v>

2442
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 7>that's a very adolescent immature thing and it's probably there to a certain</v>

2443
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 7>effect and the evolution of the adaptation of the human being as he grows.</v>

2444
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 7>But if you have a system doesn't support or reinforce those issues,</v>

2445
01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 7>the then the miserable cock suckers and dimwits and assholes and jerk off small</v>

2446
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 7>won't materialize.</v>

2447
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:40.620
<v Speaker 7>They need,</v>

2448
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 7>but they're here.</v>

2449
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.150
<v Speaker 7>We need to figure out how to get rid of them either to get rid of him or to fix</v>

2450
01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:46.140
<v Speaker 7>them and bring them up.</v>

2451
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 7>That's going to be very difficult because that's a real issue.</v>

2452
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 7>It's a real,</v>

2453
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 7>it's super real issue at the core of everything.</v>

2454
01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:52.940
<v Speaker 7>It's an educational problems.</v>

2455
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 7>Why Doug?</v>

2456
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:53.791
<v Speaker 7>Stan Hope,</v>

2457
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 7>how to stop doing as parties in the desert.</v>

2458
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:57.663
<v Speaker 7>It is what it is.</v>

2459
01:11:57.670 --> 01:11:58.530
<v Speaker 7>I didn't hear Doug,</v>

2460
01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.221
<v Speaker 7>Doug,</v>

2461
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:00.054
<v Speaker 7>Stan hope,</v>

2462
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 7>my buddy and a hilarious comedian used to have these parties in the desert.</v>

2463
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 7>But you would have like,</v>

2464
01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:08.010
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2465
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 7>anybody could come and everybody knew about it online.</v>

2466
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:15.170
<v Speaker 7>So you would have like a thousand really cool people and to just unbearable</v>

2467
01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:15.830
<v Speaker 7>Douche.</v>

2468
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

2469
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 7>And the too unbearable douchebags would make the,</v>

2470
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 7>make the whole party useless.</v>

2471
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 7>And those guys need to be,</v>

2472
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 7>you have new,</v>

2473
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 7>you have to figure out what to do with them.</v>

2474
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:24.781
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

2475
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 7>there's some people out there that are off fucking mess,</v>

2476
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 7>not an issue of having this beautiful solar dome.</v>

2477
01:12:30.451 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 7>Where y'all all this hippie pussy inside.</v>

2478
01:12:32.731 --> 01:12:33.780
<v Speaker 7>Just line it up for you.</v>

2479
01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.020
<v Speaker 7>We're still going to have to deal with the barbarians at the gates cause</v>

2480
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:38.550
<v Speaker 7>otherwise they liked the,</v>

2481
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 7>like the New Orleans,</v>

2482
01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.210
<v Speaker 7>it's stormed Egypt and took over the pyramids.</v>

2483
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 7>They're going to come in and rush this bitch.</v>

2484
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.360
<v Speaker 7>Well I don't,</v>

2485
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 7>I don't see this materializing in some isolated place,</v>

2486
01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.360
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2487
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 7>where the barbarians are waiting on the sidelines to uh,</v>

2488
01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:51.160
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

2489
01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.160
<v Speaker 7>there are people.</v>

2490
01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2491
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.791
<v Speaker 7>the power went out.</v>

2492
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 7>Right now there'd be hordes of our bearings on the street with hockey sticks and</v>

2493
01:12:57.151 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Speaker 7>guns and whatever the fuck they could look at whatever the fuck you had.</v>

2494
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:02.470
<v Speaker 7>And that would last for a little while until,</v>

2495
01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.930
<v Speaker 7>until someone said,</v>

2496
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.101
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2497
01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to do that if we just calm down a moment.</v>

2498
01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.330
<v Speaker 7>So the transition can happen.</v>

2499
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.320
<v Speaker 7>Even with the people that we have now that seem to be the creme de la creme,</v>

2500
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 7>the victims of this culture,</v>

2501
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 7>it just going to take a great deal of care.</v>

2502
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.660
<v Speaker 7>And I think as a natural consequences,</v>

2503
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:19.620
<v Speaker 7>the system fails.</v>

2504
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:22.500
<v Speaker 7>There'll be a great number of people that will turn around faster than you would</v>

2505
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 7>believe.</v>

2506
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 7>Once their needs are pulled away from them,</v>

2507
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 7>they realized that their needs have to come from some other process or somewhere</v>

2508
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:29.064
<v Speaker 7>else.</v>

2509
01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:30.870
<v Speaker 7>Then the adaptation becomes natural.</v>

2510
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.111
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2511
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 7>one of the things about the occupy Wall Street movement that's fascinated me is</v>

2512
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.440
<v Speaker 7>the idea that all these people sort of lived together.</v>

2513
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.190
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2514
01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:38.730
<v Speaker 7>they don't,</v>

2515
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 7>they're not just,</v>

2516
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:40.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2517
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 7>protesting together.</v>

2518
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:44.010
<v Speaker 7>They have fucking tents and they have a community there.</v>

2519
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 7>They have books you could like go to their little library and read their books.</v>

2520
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 7>They have,</v>

2521
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.370
<v Speaker 7>I'm all set up there,</v>

2522
01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:51.570
<v Speaker 7>you know that's so,</v>

2523
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's essentially right now it's not really a commune but it's on its way</v>

2524
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.091
<v Speaker 7>and they could easily,</v>

2525
01:13:57.091 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 7>it's one of those guys said,</v>

2526
01:13:58.051 --> 01:13:58.661
<v Speaker 7>listen man,</v>

2527
01:13:58.661 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 7>my car,</v>

2528
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 7>my cousin has a hundred acres out in the wilderness and they have fruit trees</v>

2529
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 7>and they have the grow vegetables and it's animals and we can hide and we can</v>

2530
01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:06.840
<v Speaker 7>make a fucking culture.</v>

2531
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:08.160
<v Speaker 7>Let's do this.</v>

2532
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 7>As long as we don't show any aggression towards the government.</v>

2533
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Certainly been done before,</v>

2534
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but then they shut you down and they go Waco on your ass and fucking toys the</v>

2535
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.113
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

2536
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 5>Or if you're a whole nother country,</v>

2537
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 5>like the attempts of the Bolshevik revolution of some something new,</v>

2538
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.370
<v Speaker 5>despite what anyone ever thought of communism,</v>

2539
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 5>that was quickly shut down as a concept by the western powers.</v>

2540
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be totally nonthreatening.</v>

2541
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.580
<v Speaker 2>If you want to start this cult,</v>

2542
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 2>we have to like get a nice piece of property,</v>

2543
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be real pretty and there's no property.</v>

2544
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:36.981
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a,</v>

2545
01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:38.310
<v Speaker 2>this is an evolution of ideas.</v>

2546
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to,</v>

2547
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:40.780
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to set up any shit on me,</v>

2548
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.261
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2549
01:14:41.261 --> 01:14:42.060
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need a car,</v>

2550
01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:42.893
<v Speaker 2>a camp.</v>

2551
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Can they get an EAD camp,</v>

2552
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:45.214
<v Speaker 2>Peter?</v>

2553
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.793
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2554
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:47.911
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

2555
01:14:47.911 --> 01:14:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2556
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.390
<v Speaker 2>right outside of Arizona and my Jim,</v>

2557
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Jim Jones glasses.</v>

2558
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't need glasses,</v>

2559
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:52.781
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2560
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:54.130
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be fine.</v>

2561
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.090
<v Speaker 2>You're really good at this.</v>

2562
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 2>You can make it back to these people and just,</v>

2563
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:03.090
<v Speaker 2>and just run the whole big solar dome right there from a Sonoma Sonoma's a good</v>

2564
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:04.661
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

2565
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:05.494
<v Speaker 2>They're prepared.</v>

2566
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.611
<v Speaker 2>They're accepting it.</v>

2567
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:07.070
<v Speaker 2>They're ready.</v>

2568
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.570
<v Speaker 2>They've got the crystals out there ready to take the vitamin.</v>

2569
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:11.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Led is going to happen,</v>

2571
01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:13.271
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2572
01:15:13.271 --> 01:15:13.481
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

2573
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:14.314
<v Speaker 2>you think that,</v>

2574
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2575
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:18.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a situation where money is going to lose all of its value,</v>

2576
01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:18.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2577
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 2>where it's going to be so bad and the economy's going to get bankrupts so</v>

2578
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:28.780
<v Speaker 2>inextricably that we're going to be stuck in a situation where we're like,</v>

2579
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 2>like Russia was at one point in time or you know,</v>

2580
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.890
<v Speaker 2>where they were waiting on line with bales of money to buy a loaf of bread.</v>

2581
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:36.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2582
01:15:36.341 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you're already do you see</v>

2583
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.410
<v Speaker 5>in the military realization of the police,</v>

2584
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 5>you're already seeing the social destabilization spread because of the faulty</v>

2585
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 5>economic premise that is creating the unemployment that is creating the debt</v>

2586
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:52.021
<v Speaker 5>crisis that will invariably highly be very inhibited by the energy crisis if</v>

2587
01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 5>massive moves aren't met.</v>

2588
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.060
<v Speaker 5>So the three issues,</v>

2589
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:55.930
<v Speaker 5>as I mentioned before,</v>

2590
01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 5>is the unemployment crisis.</v>

2591
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 5>And I can expand on that.</v>

2592
01:15:59.201 --> 01:16:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Let's think about this for a second.</v>

2593
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 5>If you have technology replacing human labor,</v>

2594
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:07.630
<v Speaker 5>which is emitted across the board now mostly by colonists as opposed to</v>

2595
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:08.151
<v Speaker 5>economist,</v>

2596
01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 5>because economists market economists are an extreme denial on this one and many</v>

2597
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:13.384
<v Speaker 5>a debate.</v>

2598
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.460
<v Speaker 5>You replace people,</v>

2599
01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:18.430
<v Speaker 5>but you're not just replacing their job to replacing their ability to purchase</v>

2600
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 5>other stuff and circulate the economy and that that's even worse.</v>

2601
01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:23.150
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>

2602
01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 5>it's farthest extension.</v>

2603
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.400
<v Speaker 5>That means that the entire fuel of growth is being slowly shut down,</v>

2604
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 5>which means that the system will lose more and more,</v>

2605
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.730
<v Speaker 5>and the system will eventually just stifled to a point that it can't operate</v>

2606
01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:40.900
<v Speaker 5>anymore apart from common or medial jobs or problems that might arise.</v>

2607
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:44.130
<v Speaker 5>But there's no way you're going to continue employing people on this planet and</v>

2608
01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:45.280
<v Speaker 5>numbers that we have in the past.</v>

2609
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 5>It's all downhill from here because the profit motivation to replace people by</v>

2610
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 5>machines is inherent to the interest to save money.</v>

2611
01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald's has had systems on the shelf for 20 years now that would replace</v>

2612
01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.380
<v Speaker 5>everyone in their kitchen.</v>

2613
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.160
<v Speaker 5>Now they are the front kiosk systems as well.</v>

2614
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.540
<v Speaker 5>They don't do it only because they're corporate view is to be social and as an</v>

2615
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 5>employer they have a stake in that.</v>

2616
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.350
<v Speaker 5>Even though it's built the contrary to logic and if you look carefully,</v>

2617
01:17:09.351 --> 01:17:10.610
<v Speaker 5>they are automating very,</v>

2618
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:11.241
<v Speaker 5>very slowly.</v>

2619
01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:13.040
<v Speaker 5>Just like all the grocery stores are automating,</v>

2620
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:15.830
<v Speaker 5>you're reducing purchasing power and there's no way this system's going to</v>

2621
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:16.664
<v Speaker 5>maintain itself.</v>

2622
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 5>Once that continues and accelerates,</v>

2623
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 5>it's the contradiction of capitalism,</v>

2624
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 5>so the idea of human labor is becoming obsolete.</v>

2625
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.900
<v Speaker 5>That in its own right is going to inspire some serious reflection and some</v>

2626
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 5>massive upheavals.</v>

2627
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be</v>

2628
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 7>calling everybody contribute.</v>

2629
01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 7>Is it possible that everybody can find their own unique way to contribute</v>

2630
01:17:35.661 --> 01:17:40.661
<v Speaker 7>outside of manufacturing things outside of working menial jobs outside of fast</v>

2631
01:17:40.761 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 7>food supermarkets,</v>

2632
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 7>retail,</v>

2633
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.611
<v Speaker 7>when you remember that,</v>

2634
01:17:43.611 --> 01:17:44.090
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2635
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 7>it's a lot of jobs.</v>

2636
01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Consumption is twice what it was now than it was in World War II.</v>

2637
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.670
<v Speaker 5>Advertising as completely fucking per capita,</v>

2638
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.551
<v Speaker 5>twice per person,</v>

2639
01:17:54.551 --> 01:17:55.360
<v Speaker 5>per person.</v>

2640
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.890
<v Speaker 5>The average person's in America,</v>

2641
01:17:56.891 --> 01:17:59.470
<v Speaker 5>since World War Two consumes twice the amount of shit,</v>

2642
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.620
<v Speaker 5>which obviously means something's askew.</v>

2643
01:18:02.621 --> 01:18:03.011
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2644
01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:03.551
<v Speaker 5>Why is that?</v>

2645
01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:06.100
<v Speaker 5>Why do we feel the need to have all this other excess stuff?</v>

2646
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Socially speaking?</v>

2647
01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:09.510
<v Speaker 5>If you go to a small tribes that aren't,</v>

2648
01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:10.810
<v Speaker 5>don't have access to television,</v>

2649
01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:11.231
<v Speaker 5>they're very,</v>

2650
01:18:11.231 --> 01:18:11.891
<v Speaker 5>very happy with it,</v>

2651
01:18:11.891 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 5>very minimalistic life.</v>

2652
01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:13.320
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

2653
01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:17.620
<v Speaker 5>their happiness isn't contingent upon how they compare themselves to others or</v>

2654
01:18:17.621 --> 01:18:20.290
<v Speaker 5>any type of notion of value that they live in,</v>

2655
01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:23.020
<v Speaker 5>the culture that's been manifest within the resources around them.</v>

2656
01:18:23.021 --> 01:18:26.500
<v Speaker 5>And they happier than any American with the multimillion dollar house and</v>

2657
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.220
<v Speaker 5>everything else,</v>

2658
01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.630
<v Speaker 5>which is usually an antidepressants.</v>

2659
01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.670
<v Speaker 5>So we have as a neuroses that's been built,</v>

2660
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:34.360
<v Speaker 5>which is fueling all of this industry that's completely irrelevant basically.</v>

2661
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:36.370
<v Speaker 5>And the more that happens,</v>

2662
01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:37.900
<v Speaker 5>the more we try to invent new jobs.</v>

2663
01:18:37.901 --> 01:18:38.081
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2664
01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:38.621
<v Speaker 5>I had one guy,</v>

2665
01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:39.401
<v Speaker 5>economist tell me that,</v>

2666
01:18:39.401 --> 01:18:39.491
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2667
01:18:39.491 --> 01:18:41.350
<v Speaker 5>we're just going to end up using Facebook money.</v>

2668
01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:45.100
<v Speaker 5>Say we'll have everybody on the Internet doing something with Facebook or some</v>

2669
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:48.340
<v Speaker 5>other network was somehow they gain credits and they'll use those credits as</v>

2670
01:18:48.341 --> 01:18:49.540
<v Speaker 5>currency now.</v>

2671
01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:49.900
<v Speaker 5>Is that right?</v>

2672
01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:50.141
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:18:50.141 --> 01:18:50.441
<v Speaker 7>Something,</v>

2674
01:18:50.441 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 7>I dunno know,</v>

2675
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.160
<v Speaker 7>I was talking about this like a year ago.</v>

2676
01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:53.621
<v Speaker 7>Remember this,</v>

2677
01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:54.880
<v Speaker 7>just remember Joe,</v>

2678
01:18:54.881 --> 01:18:59.410
<v Speaker 7>we talked about where the future's going to be post with your buddy.</v>

2679
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:02.040
<v Speaker 5>And my point is it wouldn't surprise me if we reached that point where you have</v>

2680
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:05.640
<v Speaker 5>a whole group of these freaks like straight out like idiocracy or something</v>

2681
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:10.680
<v Speaker 5>where they're all doing the most relevant actions are relevant.</v>

2682
01:19:10.681 --> 01:19:11.461
<v Speaker 5>Waste of life,</v>

2683
01:19:11.461 --> 01:19:15.150
<v Speaker 5>waste of the human brain does nothing to contribute just to maintain the,</v>

2684
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:16.800
<v Speaker 5>the idea of employment.</v>

2685
01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.200
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think that's going to happen.</v>

2686
01:19:19.201 --> 01:19:20.310
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to self destruct.</v>

2687
01:19:20.311 --> 01:19:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Once the energy crisis hits and the debt crisis,</v>

2688
01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:24.630
<v Speaker 5>which continues to strangle hold the entire planet,</v>

2689
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.280
<v Speaker 5>these three things will combine.</v>

2690
01:19:26.281 --> 01:19:27.450
<v Speaker 5>I can't predict the future,</v>

2691
01:19:27.451 --> 01:19:30.180
<v Speaker 5>but I think within a couple of years you're going to see some very,</v>

2692
01:19:30.181 --> 01:19:32.520
<v Speaker 5>very radical shifts in a lot of governments on this planet.</v>

2693
01:19:32.521 --> 01:19:33.990
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of detachment will occur.</v>

2694
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.160
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see an extension of military invasions.</v>

2695
01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.050
<v Speaker 5>They got out of a rock,</v>

2696
01:19:37.051 --> 01:19:39.630
<v Speaker 5>they're going to go into a raw and they gotta get their energy resources there.</v>

2697
01:19:39.631 --> 01:19:43.440
<v Speaker 5>They've got a secure in the Middle East for other resources as far as minerals</v>

2698
01:19:43.441 --> 01:19:44.970
<v Speaker 5>and gold and other things that are there too.</v>

2699
01:19:44.971 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

2700
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.230
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

2701
01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:47.760
<v Speaker 5>the faster collapses,</v>

2702
01:19:47.761 --> 01:19:52.140
<v Speaker 5>the more criminal the meltdown becomes and that's something too I think people</v>

2703
01:19:52.141 --> 01:19:54.270
<v Speaker 5>should pay attention to and we haven't even seen shit yet.</v>

2704
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.470
<v Speaker 5>Now that we have time holes.</v>

2705
01:19:55.471 --> 01:19:55.891
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2706
01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:56.161
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

2707
01:19:56.161 --> 01:19:58.500
<v Speaker 5>did you see that Pentagon created some time</v>

2708
01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.360
<v Speaker 7>and now they can make it Vince disappear?</v>

2709
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:02.081
<v Speaker 7>Well No.</v>

2710
01:20:02.081 --> 01:20:06.100
<v Speaker 7>First of all you're dealing with like a nanoseconds you're dealing with right</v>

2711
01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:06.371
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

2712
01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 7>This is version one</v>

2713
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.250
<v Speaker 6>and this is only what they're telling us about they they,</v>

2714
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 6>they could have been having these time holes for some time.</v>

2715
01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I think so because essentially the Pentagon is using guys that are at the</v>

2716
01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:19.250
<v Speaker 2>forefront of science and the forefront of science is pretty,</v>

2717
01:20:19.251 --> 01:20:20.061
<v Speaker 2>it's published.</v>

2718
01:20:20.061 --> 01:20:21.740
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much out there.</v>

2719
01:20:21.741 --> 01:20:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows pretty much what everybody is working on.</v>

2720
01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>

2721
01:20:24.201 --> 01:20:24.700
<v Speaker 2>and they mean there are,</v>

2722
01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.390
<v Speaker 2>there's some definitely some black op projects,</v>

2723
01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:27.240
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2724
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2725
01:20:27.801 --> 01:20:31.790
<v Speaker 2>these guys is that there's not a whole lot of these dudes and the way they stay</v>

2726
01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:32.900
<v Speaker 2>at this level of,</v>

2727
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:33.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2728
01:20:33.341 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>of being a bad superintelligent motherfucker have to exchange information.</v>

2729
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:38.140
<v Speaker 6>How far,</v>

2730
01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:38.711
<v Speaker 6>how long is it?</v>

2731
01:20:38.711 --> 01:20:39.640
<v Speaker 6>Just a few seconds.</v>

2732
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.590
<v Speaker 6>Like some athletic my nipple and I'd be like,</v>

2733
01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:42.221
<v Speaker 6>who did this?</v>

2734
01:20:42.221 --> 01:20:42.670
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2735
01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:43.760
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't even believe</v>

2736
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:44.530
<v Speaker 2>receive it.</v>

2737
01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:45.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you'd be able to perceive it.</v>

2738
01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:49.780
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that this is just one full 40 pico seconds.</v>

2739
01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2740
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:51.873
<v Speaker 2>It's what it's,</v>

2741
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.270
<v Speaker 2>the research is admit there's a big difference between human hiding.</v>

2742
01:20:55.271 --> 01:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Laser means 40 picoseconds and hiding military operations.</v>

2743
01:20:58.241 --> 01:21:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Lasting minutes or even several seconds.</v>

2744
01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.450
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that they've,</v>

2745
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they've started it.</v>

2746
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2747
01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2748
01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.810
<v Speaker 2>They started some interesting,</v>

2749
01:21:04.811 --> 01:21:05.261
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>

2750
01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>That is really exciting.</v>

2751
01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:07.051
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2752
01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:07.331
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2753
01:21:07.331 --> 01:21:07.541
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2754
01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:07.991
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>

2755
01:21:07.991 --> 01:21:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

2756
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything is military.</v>

2757
01:21:09.881 --> 01:21:12.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the Pentagon is the one that fucking came up with this.</v>

2758
01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:13.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the most incredible thing.</v>

2759
01:21:13.511 --> 01:21:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Like when you look at our capacity for innovation,</v>

2760
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.900
<v Speaker 2>they're the really impressive shit is all the stuff that blows things.</v>

2761
01:21:19.901 --> 01:21:20.800
<v Speaker 2>The fuck up course.</v>

2762
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:21.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2763
01:21:21.071 --> 01:21:21.310
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2764
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.260
<v Speaker 2>cell phone cameras are really impressive.</v>

2765
01:21:23.261 --> 01:21:25.990
<v Speaker 2>It's really impressive that you can make a little video and make a movie from</v>

2766
01:21:25.991 --> 01:21:26.620
<v Speaker 2>your phone.</v>

2767
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:26.831
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2768
01:21:26.831 --> 01:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's way more impressive.</v>

2769
01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>You drop a little box out of a plane and a city evaporates.</v>

2770
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:32.830
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

2771
01:21:32.890 --> 01:21:33.221
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2772
01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:33.851
<v Speaker 2>And what is that?</v>

2773
01:21:33.851 --> 01:21:34.451
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

2774
01:21:34.451 --> 01:21:35.030
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2775
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2776
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:36.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the peak of our technology,</v>

2777
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:40.150
<v Speaker 2>the peak of our technology and it's the most impressive as a fucking laser beam</v>

2778
01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>to cut the earth and half.</v>

2779
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:42.423
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2780
01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:43.010
<v Speaker 5>if there's any,</v>

2781
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:44.420
<v Speaker 5>any better proxy,</v>

2782
01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:45.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not quite sure what is,</v>

2783
01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:45.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2784
01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:49.070
<v Speaker 5>if you look at how much energy and ingenuity is going into these things,</v>

2785
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.990
<v Speaker 5>what if we apply that idea to feeding people?</v>

2786
01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:53.060
<v Speaker 5>What if we apply that idea to doing actually relevant</v>

2787
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>the hard nose folks that occasionally I agree with.</v>

2788
01:21:56.231 --> 01:21:56.501
<v Speaker 2>Would say,</v>

2789
01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:57.610
<v Speaker 2>we know what these fucks.</v>

2790
01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't feed themselves.</v>

2791
01:21:58.991 --> 01:22:00.100
<v Speaker 2>This is evolution out there.</v>

2792
01:22:00.101 --> 01:22:01.420
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be figuring it out.</v>

2793
01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.340
<v Speaker 2>It was supposed to be getting it together,</v>

2794
01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.570
<v Speaker 2>which I don't.</v>

2795
01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:06.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't a hundred percent agree with it.</v>

2796
01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:09.080
<v Speaker 6>They should pick like a year or something where like the whole year they're</v>

2797
01:22:09.081 --> 01:22:09.290
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2798
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.561
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

2799
01:22:09.561 --> 01:22:11.990
<v Speaker 6>every scientist you're this year,</v>

2800
01:22:11.991 --> 01:22:12.824
<v Speaker 6>it's cancer.</v>

2801
01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:16.760
<v Speaker 6>You have one year and just every single scientist like devote on something</v>

2802
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 2>because scientists have particular fields that they're scientists.</v>

2803
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.501
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2804
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:26.501
<v Speaker 6>but you're all scientists see scientisty nuclear physicists to go after aids.</v>

2805
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.681
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2806
01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:29.240
<v Speaker 6>if you think of another example</v>

2807
01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:34.730
<v Speaker 5>system so inhibiting through its competitive mechanisms that the Prima Fascia</v>

2808
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:34.891
<v Speaker 5>Association,</v>

2809
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:39.090
<v Speaker 5>the assumption is that basically everyone competing amongst themselves within</v>

2810
01:22:39.091 --> 01:22:41.040
<v Speaker 5>the same sector will produce better results,</v>

2811
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:43.560
<v Speaker 5>but that's cognitive leap erroneous.</v>

2812
01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 5>You want to get people together to share their ideas,</v>

2813
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 5>not get proprietary.</v>

2814
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:48.330
<v Speaker 5>You want to do it actually,</v>

2815
01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:48.601
<v Speaker 5>if what?</v>

2816
01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:51.930
<v Speaker 5>They really have the interest to cure or solve a problem or create something of</v>

2817
01:22:51.931 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 5>the highest efficiency or utility,</v>

2818
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 5>there's no better way to do that than to get them with that creative drive.</v>

2819
01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:58.584
<v Speaker 5>In one setting.</v>

2820
01:22:58.650 --> 01:22:59.940
<v Speaker 5>So you take all the cell phone companies,</v>

2821
01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:00.774
<v Speaker 5>put them together,</v>

2822
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.080
<v Speaker 5>diminish them into one holding company for all of humanity that produced the</v>

2823
01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 5>best goddamn cell</v>

2824
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 7>phone.</v>

2825
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2826
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 7>You could do that for anything and I'm sure if we actually thought about that</v>

2827
01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.540
<v Speaker 7>cancer would be be cure.</v>

2828
01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 7>Well it was actually cancer cures out there already,</v>

2829
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 7>but cancer as we note in the establishment would have been cured a long,</v>

2830
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 7>long time ago.</v>

2831
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 7>There's way too much money being made through this competitive practice though,</v>

2832
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:24.490
<v Speaker 7>and of course the allegation of cancer and that goes back to the inefficient</v>

2833
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.990
<v Speaker 7>inefficiency mechanisms.</v>

2834
01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 7>What drives it all?</v>

2835
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 7>If I could give you the wheel,</v>

2836
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 7>if I could give you the wheel,</v>

2837
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 7>this great,</v>

2838
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 7>great world,</v>

2839
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:34.750
<v Speaker 7>this great society,</v>

2840
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:35.441
<v Speaker 7>there's one,</v>

2841
01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 7>one giant global culture,</v>

2842
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:38.351
<v Speaker 7>what would you do?</v>

2843
01:23:38.351 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Speaker 7>What would your first move if we Peter,</v>

2844
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:40.571
<v Speaker 7>Peter,</v>

2845
01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:41.021
<v Speaker 7>Joseph,</v>

2846
01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:42.670
<v Speaker 7>just throw in one the electrons.</v>

2847
01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:43.510
<v Speaker 7>It's the wrong logic.</v>

2848
01:23:43.511 --> 01:23:43.991
<v Speaker 7>Doug is as well.</v>

2849
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.160
<v Speaker 7>There wouldn't be any elections.</v>

2850
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.300
<v Speaker 7>There's no greater high insulin online poll you want and you get to be king.</v>

2851
01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 7>I would,</v>

2852
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 7>there wouldn't be a place for that.</v>

2853
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:53.720
<v Speaker 7>How do you mind?</v>

2854
01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.760
<v Speaker 7>Tague was a close second.</v>

2855
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:55.923
<v Speaker 7>You would,</v>

2856
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 7>she didn't get as much pokes,</v>

2857
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:59.960
<v Speaker 7>which is fortunately it is when he pokes his you,</v>

2858
01:23:59.961 --> 01:24:03.060
<v Speaker 7>but you know there's like ice move and prevailed and you're,</v>

2859
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 7>you're in charge of putting this thing together.</v>

2860
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:06.100
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to be right.</v>

2861
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 7>You want it all to like figure it out itself.</v>

2862
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.730
<v Speaker 7>No one single person.</v>

2863
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:14.470
<v Speaker 7>It's the greatest insult to fucking have like a president of the United States.</v>

2864
01:24:14.471 --> 01:24:16.680
<v Speaker 7>What do we in the dynasty and yes,</v>

2865
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.200
<v Speaker 7>we still are monk primitive Lynita we need an Alpha and Alpha month.</v>

2866
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:22.690
<v Speaker 7>It's apparently it is culturally.</v>

2867
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 7>We're just still still monkeys,</v>

2868
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 7>but we can percent chimpanzee or whatever we are.</v>

2869
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.320
<v Speaker 7>We can adapt pretty quickly that we have that cerebral cortex that popped out</v>

2870
01:24:29.321 --> 01:24:31.250
<v Speaker 7>that can override all those lower brain reacts,</v>

2871
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.720
<v Speaker 7>butterfly along his wig.</v>

2872
01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Gated.</v>

2873
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.031
<v Speaker 1>We grow up.</v>

2874
01:24:34.031 --> 01:24:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2875
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:34.731
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2876
01:24:34.731 --> 01:24:34.961
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2877
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:37.390
<v Speaker 1>we're taught how to squash our instincts.</v>

2878
01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Those stupid instincts are still there.</v>

2879
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 1>The instincts dominate the instincts to Gel,</v>

2880
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:42.071
<v Speaker 1>be jealous,</v>

2881
01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:43.450
<v Speaker 1>the instincts to want to fuck other dudes,</v>

2882
01:24:43.451 --> 01:24:44.230
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends,</v>

2883
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.580
<v Speaker 1>those instincts or our primal,</v>

2884
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:45.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2885
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:46.501
<v Speaker 1>they're all in there.</v>

2886
01:24:46.501 --> 01:24:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2887
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:47.480
<v Speaker 7>Maybe.</v>

2888
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 7>Maybe not though every,</v>

2889
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.981
<v Speaker 7>every film,</v>

2890
01:24:48.981 --> 01:24:51.800
<v Speaker 7>every film you see out there reinforces such things like that.</v>

2891
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:55.100
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to say just even elm reinforces it,</v>

2892
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but also does every you,</v>

2893
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.831
<v Speaker 1>your instincts,</v>

2894
01:24:57.831 --> 01:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>your own nature.</v>

2895
01:24:59.170 --> 01:24:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2896
01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>we are clearly some sort of an animal and conscious being hybrid,</v>

2897
01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2898
01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:04.511
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

2899
01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:06.830
<v Speaker 1>we battle with these very primitive,</v>

2900
01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean you ever be in front of somebody and you just want to punch them in the</v>

2901
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:09.854
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>

2902
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:10.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2903
01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:10.851
<v Speaker 1>if you are a champion,</v>

2904
01:25:10.851 --> 01:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you were living in the jungle,</v>

2905
01:25:11.811 --> 01:25:12.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what you would do,</v>

2906
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.550
<v Speaker 1>would just punch him in the head.</v>

2907
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>That chimp is pissing you off.</v>

2908
01:25:15.021 --> 01:25:15.854
<v Speaker 1>He just bite it,</v>

2909
01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:16.281
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2910
01:25:16.281 --> 01:25:16.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2911
01:25:16.461 --> 01:25:17.294
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do.</v>

2912
01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have this thing going on in our head where we're trying to squash</v>

2913
01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:23.870
<v Speaker 1>all that nonsense.</v>

2914
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Just their poop on him,</v>

2915
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

2916
01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:27.021
<v Speaker 1>You're a Bonobo.</v>

2917
01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:28.370
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm much more,</v>

2918
01:25:28.371 --> 01:25:29.520
<v Speaker 1>a much more peaceful.</v>

2919
01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:30.354
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

2920
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Most of their fights with carrying around sticks.</v>

2921
01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:33.801
<v Speaker 1>So they do,</v>

2922
01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:35.300
<v Speaker 1>whoever picks up the biggest stick,</v>

2923
01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:35.511
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2924
01:25:35.511 --> 01:25:35.781
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2925
01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:36.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2926
01:25:36.771 --> 01:25:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at that stick.</v>

2927
01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2928
01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:38.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2929
01:25:38.001 --> 01:25:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually like go to blows like the regular chimpanzees fuck each</v>

2930
01:25:41.631 --> 01:25:41.991
<v Speaker 1>other out.</v>

2931
01:25:41.991 --> 01:25:42.824
<v Speaker 1>They kill each other,</v>

2932
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>but Benobos really,</v>

2933
01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>they're mostly solve their issues through sex.</v>

2934
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:47.833
<v Speaker 1>Is that you?</v>

2935
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2936
01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you saw your boob on you?</v>

2937
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2938
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>There's no universal,</v>

2939
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no universal is no king.</v>

2940
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying and I know you're very sensitive about this because</v>

2941
01:25:58.191 --> 01:26:02.450
<v Speaker 1>that is that what happens in every situation where one person gets an inordinate</v>

2942
01:26:02.451 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 1>amount of attention.</v>

2943
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're getting</v>

2944
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.660
<v Speaker 7>and you're very charismatic dude.</v>

2945
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 7>You're very intelligent,</v>

2946
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.940
<v Speaker 7>you're very well spoken.</v>

2947
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 7>There must be some sort of a push in one sense or another to get you to kind of</v>

2948
01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:12.681
<v Speaker 7>lead things,</v>

2949
01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:13.010
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2950
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:13.251
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2951
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 7>you must feel,</v>

2952
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.811
<v Speaker 7>well that's why I'm here.</v>

2953
01:26:14.811 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm just trying to communicate these ideas.</v>

2954
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 7>Do you feel responsible?</v>

2955
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 7>Does it mean you've created a movement,</v>

2956
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2957
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.780
<v Speaker 7>I mean essentially you press the button movement created,</v>

2958
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:24.591
<v Speaker 7>it's created south,</v>

2959
01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:25.900
<v Speaker 7>but you did press start,</v>

2960
01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 7>press start.</v>

2961
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:27.321
<v Speaker 7>But then again,</v>

2962
01:26:27.321 --> 01:26:27.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2963
01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 7>in a sense of cause Audi,</v>

2964
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 7>who of us really trigger anything?</v>

2965
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 7>I could go back and take the Zeit geist film and I could say,</v>

2966
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:35.200
<v Speaker 7>well this is an influence of all these other people.</v>

2967
01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:38.040
<v Speaker 7>I can say Bill Hicks and George Carlin needs like guys,</v>

2968
01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:38.320
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2969
01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.610
<v Speaker 7>this is the values just spread.</v>

2970
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 7>It was like a,</v>

2971
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:44.820
<v Speaker 7>there's an evolution and the organism of knowledge that we really hold on to.</v>

2972
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 7>But you are part of it as well.</v>

2973
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:46.550
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2974
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.941
<v Speaker 7>I understand.</v>

2975
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 7>I know you're being humble and understand your point.</v>

2976
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:50.480
<v Speaker 7>If you didn't create that video,</v>

2977
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 7>we wouldn't be having this conversation.</v>

2978
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 7>You wouldn't have had this movement,</v>

2979
01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:54.254
<v Speaker 7>you wouldn't have.</v>

2980
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.920
<v Speaker 7>So you've charged up a lot of people's brains with that man.</v>

2981
01:26:56.921 --> 01:26:57.754
<v Speaker 7>And it was uh,</v>

2982
01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 7>there's been a lot of inspiration out there,</v>

2983
01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 7>which has come from many different directions.</v>

2984
01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.680
<v Speaker 7>So I had an issue with the nine 11 stuff that when you guys did the first video,</v>

2985
01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 7>it essentially,</v>

2986
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:13.400
<v Speaker 7>you were saying that nine 11 was an inside job and then you knew that the</v>

2987
01:27:13.401 --> 01:27:15.470
<v Speaker 7>buildings could not have come down any other way.</v>

2988
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:15.801
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2989
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that something that was said with creative license?</v>

2990
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:18.741
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2991
01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:23.150
<v Speaker 7>That's what was definitely implies to for for a fact because it was your,</v>

2992
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.850
<v Speaker 7>this was the you,</v>

2993
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 7>you did not anticipate this ever being what it was and you were just trying to</v>

2994
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:31.910
<v Speaker 7>get an effect on the assumption that the audience would of course make up their</v>

2995
01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:35.150
<v Speaker 7>own mind because before that there's a great deal of evidence and the opinion of</v>

2996
01:27:35.151 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 7>the creator.</v>

2997
01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 7>Then all probabilities moving forward.</v>

2998
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:38.211
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.800
<v Speaker 7>That statement was made declaratory.</v>

3000
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 7>You think that when you see like tower one tower two,</v>

3001
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:48.641
<v Speaker 7>do you think that they were detonated Taiwan and tell her to most probably where</v>

3002
01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.061
<v Speaker 7>it's all x,</v>

3003
01:27:50.061 --> 01:27:50.720
<v Speaker 7>Y and Z's.</v>

3004
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 7>To me we'll trade center seven by all means,</v>

3005
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 7>the World Trade Center seven is the only one that when you look at it,</v>

3006
01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:59.420
<v Speaker 7>it fell into its foundation,</v>

3007
01:27:59.421 --> 01:28:01.360
<v Speaker 7>which is exactly what happens.</v>

3008
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:04.880
<v Speaker 7>Even beyond that eye witness testimony of people that were stepping over bodies</v>

3009
01:28:04.881 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 7>from pre weakening explosions that were there.</v>

3010
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:12.581
<v Speaker 7>You have all sorts of things that do not add up seismic elements that were</v>

3011
01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 7>brought into play.</v>

3012
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:16.220
<v Speaker 7>Mostly no one died and tower seven no,</v>

3013
01:28:16.221 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 7>there was a whole sea of people.</v>

3014
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:19.340
<v Speaker 7>There was one of the guy that that mysteriously died,</v>

3015
01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:21.080
<v Speaker 7>I believe of some illness.</v>

3016
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.801
<v Speaker 7>His name was,</v>

3017
01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3018
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:22.670
<v Speaker 7>it was a black man.</v>

3019
01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:23.071
<v Speaker 7>What class?</v>

3020
01:28:23.071 --> 01:28:23.361
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>

3021
01:28:23.361 --> 01:28:24.200
<v Speaker 7>oh I know what you're talking about.</v>

3022
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 7>He was the guy who said that he saw bodies.</v>

3023
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.820
<v Speaker 7>One other person were in the elevators that blew out and the eighth floor and he</v>

3024
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 7>basically,</v>

3025
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 7>he was the only eyewitness testimony to that in the lobby.</v>

3026
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 7>And he actually worked for the mayor too,</v>

3027
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 7>which was even more interesting.</v>

3028
01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.120
<v Speaker 7>Well that one certainly looks like a demolition w the way it fell.</v>

3029
01:28:41.121 --> 01:28:41.601
<v Speaker 7>But the other,</v>

3030
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 7>the other towers,</v>

3031
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:47.300
<v Speaker 7>I've never seen a controlled demolition where it starts from the top and sort of</v>

3032
01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:48.590
<v Speaker 7>pancakes down like that.</v>

3033
01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.390
<v Speaker 7>It usually falls into itself.</v>

3034
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:51.310
<v Speaker 7>You know it too.</v>

3035
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.791
<v Speaker 7>Did you do,</v>

3036
01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 7>do it goes,</v>

3037
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:54.080
<v Speaker 7>it goes and collapse into the space.</v>

3038
01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:54.291
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3039
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:54.591
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3040
01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:55.910
<v Speaker 7>Maybe there's another way to do it.</v>

3041
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.160
<v Speaker 7>Maybe they can do it where it pancakes down,</v>

3042
01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.840
<v Speaker 7>but it also couldn't,</v>

3043
01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 7>it isn't it possible that a structural failure,</v>

3044
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 7>cause they were hit by giant jet jet engines,</v>

3045
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:05.543
<v Speaker 7>jet planes,</v>

3046
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 7>not since they were awesome.</v>

3047
01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:11.340
<v Speaker 7>They were designed to take the impact of some faulty engineering,</v>

3048
01:29:11.341 --> 01:29:13.070
<v Speaker 7>like they thought it was the idea that we were having,</v>

3049
01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 7>they were wrong.</v>

3050
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 7>A cold structure,</v>

3051
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.500
<v Speaker 7>law of conservation of momentum.</v>

3052
01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 7>You have a cold structure down here regardless of how hot it is up here to see a</v>

3053
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 7>systemic collapse.</v>

3054
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 7>If you look at the NIST studies and everything else,</v>

3055
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:25.140
<v Speaker 7>which didn't even explain the collapse by the way,</v>

3056
01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 7>it's beyond in probable.</v>

3057
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.500
<v Speaker 7>And I've yet to meet one structural engineer that could ever explain that,</v>

3058
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:34.620
<v Speaker 7>especially given the free nature of it when it hit,</v>

3059
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 7>not to mention all the other characteristics,</v>

3060
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:37.351
<v Speaker 7>fallen nature,</v>

3061
01:29:37.351 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 7>meaning it fell a very similar to free fall speed,</v>

3062
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.450
<v Speaker 7>very close to free fall speed.</v>

3063
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:43.284
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

3064
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 7>not to mention the pre weakened in explosions,</v>

3065
01:29:45.181 --> 01:29:46.460
<v Speaker 7>the subbasement explosions,</v>

3066
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 7>the recipe of it was perfectly in order with everything that you'd see in</v>

3067
01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:52.410
<v Speaker 7>controlled demolition except this was just extremely advanced and it's an</v>

3068
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:53.850
<v Speaker 7>implosion instead of an explosion.</v>

3069
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:54.420
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3070
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 7>I've had this conversation with several people who believe his exact same thing</v>

3071
01:29:58.261 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 7>and one of them was Michael [inaudible] who's on last week.</v>

3072
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:01.621
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3073
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:02.220
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3074
01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.630
<v Speaker 7>I always ask the same question,</v>

3075
01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.464
<v Speaker 7>how many people,</v>

3076
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 7>how many people know about this?</v>

3077
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 7>If you believe that that is the case and you believe that it was some sort of an</v>

3078
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.800
<v Speaker 7>inside job coordinating explosions,</v>

3079
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:11.011
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3080
01:30:11.011 --> 01:30:12.330
<v Speaker 7>if you were an engineer that could,</v>

3081
01:30:12.331 --> 01:30:13.710
<v Speaker 7>to have access to the elevator shafts,</v>

3082
01:30:13.711 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 7>which would have led you to all the pivotal structural beams that would be</v>

3083
01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 7>required to do this,</v>

3084
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 7>you could probably do it over the course of time with 15 people,</v>

3085
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:21.481
<v Speaker 7>15 people,</v>

3086
01:30:21.481 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 7>and then we'll shoot them all.</v>

3087
01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:26.150
<v Speaker 7>I've no idea if those words think about how long did it take for people to come</v>

3088
01:30:26.151 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 7>out about the Kennedy assassination.</v>

3089
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:28.350
<v Speaker 7>How long did it take for,</v>

3090
01:30:28.351 --> 01:30:28.621
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3091
01:30:28.621 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 7>all these other events that have occurred that people had been tight lipped</v>

3092
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:31.711
<v Speaker 7>about for so,</v>

3093
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:34.860
<v Speaker 7>so long thing about any historical event of black operation.</v>

3094
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:35.340
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

3095
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.140
<v Speaker 7>it's a tight club in that world.</v>

3096
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 7>Tight,</v>

3097
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:38.281
<v Speaker 7>tight club.</v>

3098
01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:38.820
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't,</v>

3099
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.800
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't surprise me at all that no one would come forward.</v>

3100
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:41.551
<v Speaker 7>My God,</v>

3101
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:42.570
<v Speaker 7>no one would come forward.</v>

3102
01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 7>And they would set up explosions and bring down two gigantic skyscrapers.</v>

3103
01:30:46.111 --> 01:30:47.130
<v Speaker 7>Why the world watched.</v>

3104
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.920
<v Speaker 7>And none of those assholes wanting to claim credit for that.</v>

3105
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:54.060
<v Speaker 7>No one wants to step up and say they had something to do with that based on</v>

3106
01:30:54.061 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 7>historical precedent.</v>

3107
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 7>Precedent doesn't surprise me at all.</v>

3108
01:30:57.001 --> 01:30:59.460
<v Speaker 7>Just go back and look at all the history of black operations,</v>

3109
01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:00.330
<v Speaker 7>CIA and FBI.</v>

3110
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.770
<v Speaker 7>Look at the names that were under it.</v>

3111
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.090
<v Speaker 7>Where did those people go?</v>

3112
01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:05.370
<v Speaker 7>Why didn't they talk about the things that are involved in before?</v>

3113
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:10.380
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting that I know you know about Hitler burned the rice stag and Nero</v>

3114
01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:13.140
<v Speaker 7>burned Rome and we know that this situation has been,</v>

3115
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.380
<v Speaker 7>it's happened in history before where someone has created some sort of an</v>

3116
01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 7>artificial dilemma to resolve it and they've done it,</v>

3117
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:20.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3118
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:24.090
<v Speaker 7>to pass laws to impose their agenda,</v>

3119
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:24.780
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>

3120
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 7>But then when someone tells me that Oklahoma City,</v>

3121
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:30.450
<v Speaker 7>they blew it up just to pass new terrorism laws,</v>

3122
01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:30.990
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

3123
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:32.000
<v Speaker 7>get the fuck outta here.</v>

3124
01:31:32.001 --> 01:31:32.121
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3125
01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:32.330
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3126
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.881
<v Speaker 7>it's hard of me.</v>

3127
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 7>Doesn't want to accept that.</v>

3128
01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:35.700
<v Speaker 7>Part of me is,</v>

3129
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 7>even though I know that it's been done before,</v>

3130
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:39.150
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

3131
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 7>there's a certain,</v>

3132
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.000
<v Speaker 7>it's a more complicated web.</v>

3133
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:47.050
<v Speaker 7>It was recently released that the FBI has been involved in over 50% of terrorist</v>

3134
01:31:47.941 --> 01:31:49.590
<v Speaker 7>acts that have occurred on us soil.</v>

3135
01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:54.510
<v Speaker 7>What they do is they infiltrate and then they enable in certain ways and</v>

3136
01:31:54.511 --> 01:31:58.320
<v Speaker 7>sometimes they busted him in the middle or they let it go forward.</v>

3137
01:31:58.650 --> 01:31:59.010
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

3138
01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 7>I think the first</v>

3139
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 5>World Trade Center bombing,</v>

3140
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:01.744
<v Speaker 5>you had the guy with the,</v>

3141
01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.190
<v Speaker 5>the recording of the,</v>

3142
01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>

3143
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:04.150
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3144
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:04.541
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

3145
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:05.020
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3146
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 5>the agent that was there that was working with a terrorist and sided with the</v>

3147
01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 5>FBI and the FBI told him to go forward with the explosion.</v>

3148
01:32:11.711 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 5>They gave him the bomb to do so,</v>

3149
01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.550
<v Speaker 5>so that that didn't need to happen.</v>

3150
01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 5>That's public record really.</v>

3151
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 5>So they knew he was going to blow up the World Trade Center.</v>

3152
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 5>They had infiltrated the group long before noon.</v>

3153
01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:24.610
<v Speaker 5>So suspicious.</v>

3154
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:24.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3155
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:25.091
<v Speaker 5>they led,</v>

3156
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 5>they gave him the explosion.</v>

3157
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:26.980
<v Speaker 5>They gave him the detonator,</v>

3158
01:32:26.981 --> 01:32:29.190
<v Speaker 5>the FBI handed Salaam,</v>

3159
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.060
<v Speaker 5>it was his name and they,</v>

3160
01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:34.780
<v Speaker 5>the guy recorded these conversations because he was so upset by what the FBI</v>

3161
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 5>wanted him to do.</v>

3162
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 5>All that.</v>

3163
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 5>All of that's in the Zike guys moving companion guide.</v>

3164
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:40.041
<v Speaker 5>By the way.</v>

3165
01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:40.781
<v Speaker 5>It's perfectly honest.</v>

3166
01:32:40.781 --> 01:32:42.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm so sick of talking about that shit.</v>

3167
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.070
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3168
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3169
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:44.620
<v Speaker 5>it's always the drill there.</v>

3170
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:45.910
<v Speaker 5>God Damn though.</v>

3171
01:32:45.911 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 5>That's unbelievable.</v>

3172
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:50.010
<v Speaker 5>I know about the guy and I believe it was Dallas where um,</v>

3173
01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 5>they talked him into blowing something up,</v>

3174
01:32:52.121 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 5>gave him a fake bomb,</v>

3175
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 5>set him up and he went and did it and then they were of them.</v>

3176
01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:56.401
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3177
01:32:56.401 --> 01:32:57.220
<v Speaker 5>that is just,</v>

3178
01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 5>you found some really dumb guy.</v>

3179
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to see.</v>

3180
01:33:00.971 --> 01:33:03.760
<v Speaker 5>If you look at all the warnings of a Solomon Law and an al Qaeda,</v>

3181
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 5>easy to see how that CIA,</v>

3182
01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:08.500
<v Speaker 5>FBI agents infiltrated a rogue group that we're planning to do a terrorist</v>

3183
01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:13.450
<v Speaker 5>attack in the world trade center infiltrated and aided and to make sure it</v>

3184
01:33:13.451 --> 01:33:15.040
<v Speaker 5>worked in the way that they wanted it to.</v>

3185
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Even after the fact with industrial industrial organizing,</v>

3186
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:21.610
<v Speaker 5>perhaps with the die in the first World Trade Center bombing,</v>

3187
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.410
<v Speaker 5>I believe a couple of people did.</v>

3188
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:24.280
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that big though.</v>

3189
01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.510
<v Speaker 5>I think it was seven people or something.</v>

3190
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 5>So they're responsible for those seven deaths.</v>

3191
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 5>And the only reason that didn't bring down a major been by the way is cause</v>

3192
01:33:31.361 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 5>there was another van parked in the wrong spot.</v>

3193
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to be right by this one support beam.</v>

3194
01:33:35.201 --> 01:33:35.591
<v Speaker 5>If it did,</v>

3195
01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 5>it would have partially imploded down,</v>

3196
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.120
<v Speaker 5>partially collapsed again in a whole lot more people would have died.</v>

3197
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.920
<v Speaker 5>So you believe that they could 15 people could have rigged the World Trade</v>

3198
01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Center towers and over the course of many months,</v>

3199
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:47.914
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

3200
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 5>And they could have been planning this thing out the whole time and Dick</v>

3201
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 5>Cheney's got all these don't go so far to say it has anything to do with</v>

3202
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:56.160
<v Speaker 5>presidents are in like that.</v>

3203
01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:57.003
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

3204
01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a standard operating procedure,</v>

3205
01:33:58.691 --> 01:33:59.810
<v Speaker 5>black operation that's,</v>

3206
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 5>that's telltale back in time.</v>

3207
01:34:02.021 --> 01:34:04.900
<v Speaker 5>And just look at how they operate it before and they just did it again.</v>

3208
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 5>Who uh,</v>

3209
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:06.760
<v Speaker 5>who sets it up?</v>

3210
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:08.523
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3211
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:09.880
<v Speaker 5>it's not that obvious.</v>

3212
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:12.520
<v Speaker 5>Corporate interest in Wall Street are highly intertwined.</v>

3213
01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.380
<v Speaker 5>CIA and Wall Street are highly intertwined.</v>

3214
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:19.600
<v Speaker 5>You can't speculate on how this idea would really come to fruition.</v>

3215
01:34:19.810 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 5>All you could think of is that yes,</v>

3216
01:34:22.001 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 5>you have the options there and you have the Preston to do so I have no idea</v>

3217
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:26.021
<v Speaker 5>where the source would be.</v>

3218
01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:26.481
<v Speaker 5>It it,</v>

3219
01:34:26.481 --> 01:34:28.870
<v Speaker 5>it had so many benefits and so many different levels.</v>

3220
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Namely benefit though is to the administration,</v>

3221
01:34:32.051 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 5>the interest of the oil industry to move in on the power's in the Middle East</v>

3222
01:34:35.291 --> 01:34:38.410
<v Speaker 5>and give the ultimate precedent and as a side effect,</v>

3223
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:41.740
<v Speaker 5>they were going to orchestrate it though wouldn't they orchestrated with some</v>

3224
01:34:41.741 --> 01:34:43.300
<v Speaker 5>people like if we're going to go to Iraq,</v>

3225
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:44.223
<v Speaker 5>that's the plan.</v>

3226
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 5>Would they have Iraqi's attack us?</v>

3227
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:48.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they could have infiltrated it,</v>

3228
01:34:48.221 --> 01:34:49.900
<v Speaker 5>but they tried their hardest dependent on Saddam.</v>

3229
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I had one of the first publications by the way,</v>

3230
01:34:51.641 --> 01:34:53.830
<v Speaker 5>that was produced the day after nine 11 by Time magazine.</v>

3231
01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 5>It's the most amazing piece of propaganda.</v>

3232
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:56.914
<v Speaker 5>You flipped through it.</v>

3233
01:34:56.990 --> 01:35:00.200
<v Speaker 5>You have every horrible shot as exaggerated as possible and then boom,</v>

3234
01:35:00.201 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 5>you hit,</v>

3235
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 5>you hit Osama bin Ladin.</v>

3236
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:03.043
<v Speaker 5>There he is.</v>

3237
01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Next page,</v>

3238
01:35:04.101 --> 01:35:05.570
<v Speaker 5>Saddam Hussein.</v>

3239
01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Next page,</v>

3240
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.930
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3241
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.170
<v Speaker 5>the guy from Korea.</v>

3242
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.970
<v Speaker 5>So they just lined them up psychologically and he could easily have seen Saddam</v>

3243
01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:14.541
<v Speaker 5>was a highlight.</v>

3244
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:15.374
<v Speaker 5>He was sitting there with a big,</v>

3245
01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.310
<v Speaker 5>big,</v>

3246
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 5>big bazooka.</v>

3247
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:18.260
<v Speaker 5>It was hilarious.</v>

3248
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:18.621
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was,</v>

3249
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:22.430
<v Speaker 5>there was this planted as you could possibly get and which is not a new thing</v>

3250
01:35:22.431 --> 01:35:23.264
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

3251
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:26.300
<v Speaker 5>It's just sad to see how people have no sense of history.</v>

3252
01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 5>They don't really understand how business has been covert for so long.</v>

3253
01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:32.121
<v Speaker 5>And then again,</v>

3254
01:35:32.121 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 5>what would you expect?</v>

3255
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:34.280
<v Speaker 5>Big government is a business.</v>

3256
01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:35.090
<v Speaker 5>That's what it runs.</v>

3257
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:36.260
<v Speaker 5>It's one big business.</v>

3258
01:35:36.261 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 5>We expect more transparency because we have so much more information.</v>

3259
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.750
<v Speaker 5>Transparency was never there to begin with.</v>

3260
01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 5>The only reason that we thought we'd never had the internet either.</v>

3261
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.151
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3262
01:35:44.151 --> 01:35:47.600
<v Speaker 5>But the reason we think is because now it starts to leak because of how powerful</v>

3263
01:35:47.601 --> 01:35:49.520
<v Speaker 5>than the wikileaks and people with consciences,</v>

3264
01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:49.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3265
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 5>coming forward and trying to help and make these things come out.</v>

3266
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:54.853
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

3267
01:35:55.090 --> 01:35:56.710
<v Speaker 5>it's really going back to the,</v>

3268
01:35:56.711 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 5>the social system,</v>

3269
01:35:58.190 --> 01:35:58.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3270
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:59.361
<v Speaker 5>flaw.</v>

3271
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 5>If it's a survival of the fittest concept,</v>

3272
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:03.080
<v Speaker 5>if it's a competitive system,</v>

3273
01:36:03.210 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter whether it's two people competing for a job to corporations</v>

3274
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 5>competing for market share or two countries competing for resources and their</v>

3275
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:13.490
<v Speaker 5>own esteem or whatever their interests are as an empire.</v>

3276
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:15.410
<v Speaker 5>It's the same fundamental logic.</v>

3277
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:18.080
<v Speaker 5>When Julian Assange,</v>

3278
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:18.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3279
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:20.810
<v Speaker 5>came out with all this information,</v>

3280
01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.040
<v Speaker 5>released all this shit,</v>

3281
01:36:22.041 --> 01:36:24.350
<v Speaker 5>and what did you think was gonna Happen to that guy?</v>

3282
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 5>I was just disappointed that he chose to put himself in the forefront because it</v>

3283
01:36:29.721 --> 01:36:32.480
<v Speaker 5>painted a picture of a personality cult of personality,</v>

3284
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 5>which I just can't stand.</v>

3285
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.700
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what,</v>

3286
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:34.920
<v Speaker 5>what I,</v>

3287
01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 5>I figured he would just be,</v>

3288
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 5>he would be character assessed the left and right.</v>

3289
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:39.830
<v Speaker 5>I doubt they would try to do anything to him physically.</v>

3290
01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.300
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think he did it?</v>

3291
01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.310
<v Speaker 5>It was an ego moved to put himself and it was inadvertent.</v>

3292
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:44.811
<v Speaker 5>I think he had,</v>

3293
01:36:44.811 --> 01:36:45.561
<v Speaker 5>he was a spokesman.</v>

3294
01:36:45.561 --> 01:36:46.221
<v Speaker 5>It was inadvertent,</v>

3295
01:36:46.221 --> 01:36:46.820
<v Speaker 5>but if,</v>

3296
01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.670
<v Speaker 5>if I had was in that position of such massive attention,</v>

3297
01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:53.480
<v Speaker 5>I would gotten a team to take the reins and not have one entity that way.</v>

3298
01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 5>There's less for them to attack.</v>

3299
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.420
<v Speaker 5>There's anything that I do in my work,</v>

3300
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 5>even though I don't consider myself to be that famous is I,</v>

3301
01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:03.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm always dispersing and getting other people to do lots of other things and</v>

3302
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 5>take the attention away from myself for many different purposes.</v>

3303
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.281
<v Speaker 5>For one,</v>

3304
01:37:07.281 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't really feel comfortable with that.</v>

3305
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:10.000
<v Speaker 5>Any type of role as you've,</v>

3306
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.940
<v Speaker 5>you've joked about,</v>

3307
01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:13.590
<v Speaker 5>it's really not in my character whatsoever.</v>

3308
01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Never that you've gotten to this point that I just feel like I've been pushed.</v>

3309
01:37:17.261 --> 01:37:17.321
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3310
01:37:17.321 --> 01:37:18.770
<v Speaker 5>it's sold like little Martin Luther King thing.</v>

3311
01:37:18.771 --> 01:37:18.951
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3312
01:37:18.951 --> 01:37:21.090
<v Speaker 5>he just felt like a big Martin Luther King Fan.</v>

3313
01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.550
<v Speaker 5>He was felt like he was pushed.</v>

3314
01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:25.820
<v Speaker 5>So I kind of allow myself to be just be pushed and I kind of go with the flow,</v>

3315
01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.350
<v Speaker 5>but there's nothing more important to me than showing a larger face to this type</v>

3316
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:33.890
<v Speaker 5>of concept and not get caught up in the cult of personality issue.</v>

3317
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:35.600
<v Speaker 5>So it has a few different psychological,</v>

3318
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.240
<v Speaker 5>are you making a living doing lectures now?</v>

3319
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:39.074
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you doing?</v>

3320
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 5>I have never been paid for a lecture.</v>

3321
01:37:40.791 --> 01:37:45.791
<v Speaker 5>I make a modest living trying to commercially now exploit zeitgeists and</v>

3322
01:37:45.801 --> 01:37:48.840
<v Speaker 5>occasionally I believe in and I still do some equity things and we do it.</v>

3323
01:37:48.841 --> 01:37:51.950
<v Speaker 5>We have to do in this system but I so you're out.</v>

3324
01:37:51.951 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 5>They're scamming the people now I I'm scamming traders.</v>

3325
01:37:55.591 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 5>That's what you</v>

3326
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 7>do.</v>

3327
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:57.080
<v Speaker 7>Is that what you do?</v>

3328
01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:57.841
<v Speaker 7>It's a little,</v>

3329
01:37:57.841 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 7>it's like a game you play.</v>

3330
01:37:59.190 --> 01:37:59.611
<v Speaker 7>It is,</v>

3331
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:00.444
<v Speaker 7>it's all it is.</v>

3332
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.061
<v Speaker 7>You do it.</v>

3333
01:38:01.061 --> 01:38:01.850
<v Speaker 7>You have to do,</v>

3334
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 7>you know I could just be a bartender somewhere.</v>

3335
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.261
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3336
01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:04.561
<v Speaker 7>you pick,</v>

3337
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:05.430
<v Speaker 7>you pick your poison,</v>

3338
01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:06.750
<v Speaker 7>charge money for lectures.</v>

3339
01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.030
<v Speaker 7>It seems like I don't like it.</v>

3340
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.560
<v Speaker 7>I don't like doing that because people would be nice to compensate me for</v>

3341
01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 7>travel.</v>

3342
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.791
<v Speaker 7>I appreciate that.</v>

3343
01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 7>I can't afford to just flagrantly go out there.</v>

3344
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:16.470
<v Speaker 7>I'll be fly all over the country for free.</v>

3345
01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 7>Not usually,</v>

3346
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:20.760
<v Speaker 7>but if there's an event I try to hope that they give me at least something.</v>

3347
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:21.411
<v Speaker 7>It depends on,</v>

3348
01:38:21.411 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 7>it depends on the nature of the event.</v>

3349
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 7>Are you guys going to have like some sort of an annual thing,</v>

3350

3356
01:38:32.881 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 7>that give different lectures in different subjects.</v>

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 7>you're not a conspiracy guy,</v>

3380
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:04.380
<v Speaker 7>are you?</v>

3381
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:04.530
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3382
01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:04.620
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3383
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:04.740
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3384
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:05.573
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

3385
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:06.683
<v Speaker 7>I don't care for those.</v>

3386
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 7>I see the causality of it.</v>

3387
01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 7>I don't care for the idea of conspiracy on,</v>

3388
01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 7>certainly not into the concept.</v>

3389
01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:13.614
<v Speaker 7>As a theme,</v>

3390
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:17.310
<v Speaker 7>people misunderstood the first film as far as what was said and it became quote,</v>

3391
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:21.150
<v Speaker 7>the greatest conspiracy film of all time and some press media,</v>

3392
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:22.620
<v Speaker 7>which I thought was a bad,</v>

3393
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:23.191
<v Speaker 7>it was it,</v>

3394
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:25.410
<v Speaker 7>the idea was uncultural fallibility.</v>

3395
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:25.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3396
01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 7>religious force.</v>

3397
01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 7>You have the nine 11 forests and the of the entire banking more scam.</v>

3398
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:34.460
<v Speaker 7>It was all really a matter of how publicly manipulated everyone is into to</v>

3399
01:39:34.461 --> 01:39:37.560
<v Speaker 7>believing that these things are actually legitimate and hold up the social</v>

3400
01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:42.210
<v Speaker 7>zeitgeisty well I think what you did to his package it all together in a really</v>

3401
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:45.480
<v Speaker 7>easily absorbable form that really likes sent the point home.</v>

3402
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.081
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

3403
01:39:46.081 --> 01:39:46.411
<v Speaker 7>And again,</v>

3404
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:50.310
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people started on a path of thinking that they might not have ever</v>

3405
01:39:50.311 --> 01:39:50.971
<v Speaker 7>started on.</v>

3406
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:51.481
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3407
01:39:51.481 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 7>That's the watching that seem to be so amazing.</v>

3408
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:53.401
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3409
01:39:53.401 --> 01:39:55.170
<v Speaker 7>you get emails like you've changed my life.</v>

3410
01:39:55.210 --> 01:39:57.480
<v Speaker 7>It's just amazing to see the response again,</v>

3411
01:39:57.481 --> 01:39:58.500
<v Speaker 7>completely inadvertent.</v>

3412
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.740
<v Speaker 7>But you have a certain amount of responsibility because that you feel it.</v>

3413
01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.401
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3414
01:40:02.401 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 7>I of course I feel it.</v>

3415
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:03.820
<v Speaker 7>I had,</v>

3416
01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:04.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3417
01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.570
<v Speaker 7>I don't take myself that seriously though.</v>

3418
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:08.220
<v Speaker 7>I'm just like anybody else.</v>

3419
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 7>So anytime I run into somebody that has a kind of a cult of personality thing,</v>

3420
01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 7>I really try to shut that down as fast as possible.</v>

3421
01:40:14.910 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 7>I can't stand being complimented.</v>

3422
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:17.111
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3423
01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 7>it's on.</v>

3424
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.091
<v Speaker 7>Gets crazy.</v>

3425
01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:19.620
<v Speaker 7>You are my hero like that.</v>

3426
01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:19.821
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3427
01:40:19.821 --> 01:40:20.521
<v Speaker 7>I really try.</v>

3428
01:40:20.521 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 7>It meant any chicks with tattoos your face on yet are out there?</v>

3429
01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.240
<v Speaker 7>Not that I've seen is a couple of girls who have your face on their calf.</v>

3430
01:40:27.241 --> 01:40:29.790
<v Speaker 7>Definitely the hippie pussy you get.</v>

3431
01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 7>Must be unbelievable though.</v>

3432
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 7>Thrown your way.</v>

3433
01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you're in a relationship,</v>

3434
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:33.780
<v Speaker 7>girls with tattoos.</v>

3435
01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 7>I think for some reason like tad tad curls with crystals.</v>

3436
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:38.543
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3437
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.391
<v Speaker 7>Girls Ready,</v>

3438
01:40:39.391 --> 01:40:40.800
<v Speaker 7>ready for you to start that cult.</v>

3439
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.310
<v Speaker 7>It's not,</v>

3440
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.491
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

3441
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 7>I don't have a rock star life unfortunately or fortunately.</v>

3442
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:46.260
<v Speaker 7>You need to fucking manage this shit better.</v>

3443
01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:47.700
<v Speaker 7>If you need a podcast,</v>

3444
01:40:47.701 --> 01:40:49.530
<v Speaker 7>it's not in my character to come on,</v>

3445
01:40:49.531 --> 01:40:50.160
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3446
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.240
<v Speaker 7>That's all well and good.</v>

3447
01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:52.470
<v Speaker 7>Let's pretend no one's listening.</v>

3448
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's pretend no one's listening.</v>

3449
01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's pretend that this may be just one frame and an infinite movie that goes on</v>

3450
01:40:59.081 --> 01:41:00.160
<v Speaker 2>forever and makes no sense.</v>

3451
01:41:00.161 --> 01:41:03.160
<v Speaker 2>You should be enjoying the shit out of this and you can enjoy the shit out of</v>

3452
01:41:03.161 --> 01:41:04.780
<v Speaker 2>this with rivers of Hippie Pussy.</v>

3453
01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you that Matt.</v>

3454
01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.513
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately,</v>

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.040

<v Speaker 5>I do a radio.</v>

3469
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.380
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>

3470
01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Yuki,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it on regular radio,</v>

3473
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.840
<v Speaker 2>blog talk radio that we do for the movement?</v>

3474
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.733
<v Speaker 2>It's just a free,</v>

3475
01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>is it online?</v>

3476
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.331
<v Speaker 2>It's online,</v>

3477
01:41:28.331 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 2>so it's a essentially a podcast as well.</v>

3478
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.813
<v Speaker 2>It is a podcast.</v>

3479
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Just you do more.</v>

01:41:33.941 --> 01:41:34.510
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

3483
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 2>You could go on for hours and hours.</v>

3484
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:37.530
<v Speaker 2>I've got to sex squad podcast.</v>

3485
01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:39.071
<v Speaker 2>I know you do,</v>

3486
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's amazing.</v>

3487
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You never say you're like one of the most eloquent guys I think I've ever talked</v>

3488
01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:44.261
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

3489
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:44.770
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3490
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:45.581
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3491
01:41:45.581 --> 01:41:48.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I was paying attention to when I was watching your</v>

3492
01:41:48.781 --> 01:41:49.311
<v Speaker 2>presentation,</v>

3493
01:41:49.311 --> 01:41:49.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3494
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:50.620
<v Speaker 2>he's speaking so clearly.</v>

3495
01:41:50.621 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3496
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 2>he's always so good with getting as I,</v>

3497
01:41:52.710 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

3498
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:57.460
<v Speaker 2>that's not the easiest thing to do for a person like me who's essentially lived</v>

3499
01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:00.880
<v Speaker 2>at least half of my life doing public speeches,</v>

3500
01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3501
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:03.380
<v Speaker 2>either standup comedy or you know,</v>

3502
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.551
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3503
01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:04.870
<v Speaker 2>or acting stuff or</v>

3504
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:06.000
<v Speaker 5>it's not natural to me.</v>

3505
01:42:06.001 --> 01:42:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I guess cause I was a musician.</v>

3506
01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:09.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not too afraid to speak in front of people.</v>

3507
01:42:09.451 --> 01:42:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's part of it just to be a performer if you will.</v>

3508
01:42:12.061 --> 01:42:16.530
<v Speaker 5>But do you feel like at this point you have like a Zike guys act all and I say</v>

3509
01:42:16.531 --> 01:42:16.970
<v Speaker 5>act,</v>

3510
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:17.850
<v Speaker 5>not that it's bullshit,</v>

3511
01:42:17.851 --> 01:42:19.290
<v Speaker 5>but almost like with standup comedy,</v>

3512
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3513
01:42:19.681 --> 01:42:22.320
<v Speaker 5>you have subjects that you know you're going to go into and then once you get</v>

3514
01:42:22.321 --> 01:42:24.120
<v Speaker 5>into those subjects you have stuff that you already said.</v>

3515
01:42:24.150 --> 01:42:24.781
<v Speaker 5>Oh sure,</v>

3516
01:42:24.781 --> 01:42:25.081
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3517
01:42:25.081 --> 01:42:25.950
<v Speaker 5>Well it depends on the,</v>

3518
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.330
<v Speaker 5>depends on the circumstance.</v>

3519
01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.190
<v Speaker 5>It's a vast range of stuff.</v>

3520
01:42:29.191 --> 01:42:32.610
<v Speaker 5>And I could ramble on about a lot of other different issues if you want to go</v>

3521
01:42:32.611 --> 01:42:33.000
<v Speaker 5>back for it.</v>

3522
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:33.121
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3523
01:42:33.121 --> 01:42:33.310
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3524
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:34.590
<v Speaker 5>so it's formulaic obviously.</v>

3525
01:42:34.591 --> 01:42:34.681
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3526
01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:36.390
<v Speaker 5>if I'm addressing occupy Wall Street,</v>

3527
01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:38.940
<v Speaker 5>I have a very specific kind of gesture,</v>

3528
01:42:38.941 --> 01:42:40.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm going for a little more anarchic oriented,</v>

3529
01:42:40.951 --> 01:42:41.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3530
01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:44.640
<v Speaker 5>trying to get relate to their value is a little more angry cause everyone wants</v>

3531
01:42:44.641 --> 01:42:45.780
<v Speaker 5>to get routed up and you know,</v>

3532
01:42:45.781 --> 01:42:49.980
<v Speaker 5>you really can't be a fired up speech that we can give the angry Peter Joseph</v>

3533
01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:52.800
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3534
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.200
<v Speaker 5>That's a great way to get to that hip.</v>

3535
01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.840
<v Speaker 5>He Pussy you gotta be a leader that's pissed off in any communication you need</v>

3536
01:42:57.841 --> 01:42:58.451
<v Speaker 5>strategy.</v>

3537
01:42:58.451 --> 01:42:59.284
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

3538
01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:03.030
<v Speaker 5>I try my best to call or my strategy just like I'm doing right now with you.</v>

3539
01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:03.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3540
01:43:03.481 --> 01:43:03.810
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

3541
01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:04.170
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3542
01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:04.741
<v Speaker 2>so your,</v>

3543
01:43:04.741 --> 01:43:06.300
<v Speaker 2>your main Gig is this now,</v>

3544
01:43:06.301 --> 01:43:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is essentially what you're doing.</v>

3545
01:43:07.711 --> 01:43:09.180
<v Speaker 2>You do your musical Manga,</v>

3546
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.930
<v Speaker 5>you said the music's on the sidelines.</v>

3547
01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 5>I do that as a hobby.</v>

3548
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.970
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>

3549
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:16.630
<v Speaker 5>we do these art festivals and things like that to kind of make a little fun out</v>

3550
01:43:16.631 --> 01:43:17.051
<v Speaker 5>of things.</v>

3551
01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:18.880
<v Speaker 5>The socially conscious art festival we had a while back,</v>

3552
01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:19.860
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3553
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 5>the music's on the sidelines.</v>

3554
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:21.620
<v Speaker 5>The film is,</v>

3555
01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:23.560
<v Speaker 5>I have a new film coming out at the end of this year,</v>

3556
01:43:23.561 --> 01:43:24.110
<v Speaker 5>so what does that,</v>

3557
01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:26.800
<v Speaker 5>it's like I just beyond the Pale and hopefully by the end of 2012 I'm not</v>

3558
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:28.840
<v Speaker 5>completely set on that,</v>

3559
01:43:28.841 --> 01:43:31.750
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to be the fourth to be a live action one.</v>

3560
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:33.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to give away too much about it,</v>

3561
01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:36.610
<v Speaker 5>but like live action one meaning it's going to be a documentary,</v>

3562
01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:39.190
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to be a very untraditional documentary.</v>

3563
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:40.383
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3564
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.721
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3565
01:43:40.721 --> 01:43:41.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to talk about it because,</v>

3566
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:42.971
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to be,</v>

3567
01:43:42.971 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be very interesting.</v>

3568
01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot of characterised stablish went with this one.</v>

3569
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3570
01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:49.660
<v Speaker 5>this is going to actors in this one.</v>

3571
01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.110
<v Speaker 5>It's the same ideas,</v>

3572
01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 5>same pushing forward with this broad social expansion.</v>

3573
01:43:53.931 --> 01:43:58.700
<v Speaker 5>The idea of what a rational society is and kind of did you see moving forward.</v>

3574
01:43:58.701 --> 01:44:01.430
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a similar portrayal of the third film,</v>

3575
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 5>but in a gestural sense,</v>

3576
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:06.170
<v Speaker 5>which I think I'm excited to do because I've never done something like that.</v>

3577
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 5>Kind of a cool concept to actually show people as actors moving forward,</v>

3578
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.470
<v Speaker 5>creating some new society.</v>

3579
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 5>It's not exactly like that.</v>

3580
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Now the the fifth film I'll do theirs,</v>

3581
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:17.550
<v Speaker 5>the trilogy,</v>

3582
01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:18.470
<v Speaker 5>we're not the trilogy.</v>

3583
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:20.570
<v Speaker 5>The whole series will end and in the fifth film,</v>

3584
01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 5>this is building up to the fifth film,</v>

3585
01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but at the film's going to be a puppet show we do in a cave,</v>

3586
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:26.623
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3587
01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:29.730
<v Speaker 1>she never fucking marry that Ag.</v>

3588
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.350
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a nice fire.</v>

3589
01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.780
<v Speaker 1>We're going to lay over some bear that we just killed a,</v>

3590
01:44:33.781 --> 01:44:34.800
<v Speaker 1>as we cleaned the meat,</v>

3591
01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you'll do your public show,</v>

3592
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:36.941
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

3593
01:44:36.941 --> 01:44:39.950
<v Speaker 1>you'll explain [inaudible] post apocalyptic,</v>

3594
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:41.183
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3595
01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Explain how it all went down.</v>

3596
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3597
01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

3598
01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:43.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3599
01:44:43.921 --> 01:44:44.271
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3600
01:44:44.271 --> 01:44:45.210
<v Speaker 1>we're in danger of that.</v>

3601
01:44:45.211 --> 01:44:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we're in danger of nuclear war?</v>

3602
01:44:46.771 --> 01:44:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Is it within our grasp that we're that stupid that we might start bombing Iran</v>

3603
01:44:51.901 --> 01:44:53.010
<v Speaker 1>and they start bombing us?</v>

3604
01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 5>Big argument is how mature a society is.</v>

3605
01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:57.531
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3606
01:44:57.531 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 5>if you have molecular engineering which has come into fruition and you can have</v>

3607
01:45:01.311 --> 01:45:03.010
<v Speaker 5>someone using nanotechnology,</v>

3608
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 5>create a off the shelf with a very small lab,</v>

3609
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 5>a very destructive piece of equipment,</v>

3610
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:12.080
<v Speaker 5>the size of this bottle that can wipe out or poison or do whatever the hell</v>

3611
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:14.060
<v Speaker 5>knows to a very large landmass.</v>

3612
01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.870
<v Speaker 5>What does that say about the culture that feels the need to do that?</v>

3613
01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Because now we have a rebellion across the world in,</v>

3614
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:20.860
<v Speaker 5>in real terrorism,</v>

3615
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:21.890
<v Speaker 5>not the farce terrorism,</v>

3616
01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:26.120
<v Speaker 5>but there really is this angst that's emerged from all this deprivation from</v>

3617
01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:29.180
<v Speaker 5>abuse blow back if you want to look at it in a Chomsky hundred view.</v>

3618
01:45:29.181 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a little more complicated than that psychologically and what's</v>

3619
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:33.051
<v Speaker 5>going to happen.</v>

3620
01:45:33.051 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 5>We have a whole group of people that are so pissed and they're so deprived that</v>

3621
01:45:36.321 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 5>they begin to have abilities with technology that far exceed anything like a</v>

3622
01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:41.720
<v Speaker 5>grenade or a suitcase bomb.</v>

3623
01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.320
<v Speaker 5>So nuclear war as an extension of that seems almost inevitable.</v>

3624
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Not to mention the small destructive patterns that we can have.</v>

3625
01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people even realize that that potential is on the horizon because</v>

3626
01:45:51.711 --> 01:45:56.711
<v Speaker 5>our world is so programmed by our daily experiences were so used to certain</v>

3627
01:45:57.291 --> 01:45:59.960
<v Speaker 5>experiences and a level of those experiences and we're not,</v>

3628
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:00.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3629
01:46:00.471 --> 01:46:00.961
<v Speaker 5>we're we,</v>

3630
01:46:00.961 --> 01:46:01.550
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

3631
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:05.630
<v Speaker 5>the idea that we're at war to us as some sort of a vague thing that you see on</v>

3632
01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:07.940
<v Speaker 5>television unless you've actually been over there.</v>

3633
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:12.590
<v Speaker 5>It goes back to the point I made earlier about the broad collective social</v>

3634
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:14.450
<v Speaker 5>conscious versus the individual.</v>

3635
01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.450
<v Speaker 5>Until we begin to look at society in a social way,</v>

3636
01:46:17.451 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 5>when you look at each other as yourself talking and poetic here,</v>

3637
01:46:19.881 --> 01:46:23.540
<v Speaker 5>it's just you can't have social stability until everyone's taken care of.</v>

3638
01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:25.520
<v Speaker 5>If someone's deprived and go this side of the world,</v>

3639
01:46:25.521 --> 01:46:27.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm not safe because they can be dementia.</v>

3640
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.970
<v Speaker 5>Dementia can kick in.</v>

3641
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.130
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what biases they might emerge,</v>

3642
01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:32.930
<v Speaker 5>who they might trigger and boom.</v>

3643
01:46:32.931 --> 01:46:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly a suitcase bomb explodes behind me at some restaurant.</v>

3644
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:37.430
<v Speaker 5>No one's safe anymore.</v>

3645
01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:39.500
<v Speaker 5>With with the technological advancement,</v>

3646
01:46:39.501 --> 01:46:41.150
<v Speaker 5>we have the risks because she meant power plan.</v>

3647
01:46:41.151 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

3648
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.870
<v Speaker 5>you have to have a world conscious view at this stage,</v>

3649
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:47.420
<v Speaker 5>especially with the age of modern technology and warfare,</v>

3650
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 5>or it's just as in the words of Albert Einstein,</v>

3651
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.530
<v Speaker 7>our technology has exceeded our humanity.</v>

3652
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:54.050
<v Speaker 7>He said that when he experienced the,</v>

3653
01:46:54.051 --> 01:46:54.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3654
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:56.400
<v Speaker 7>the nuclear bomb that he helped engineer,</v>

3655
01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:56.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3656
01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:59.070
<v Speaker 7>you seed saw how bad this was.</v>

3657
01:46:59.071 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 7>Even even the,</v>

3658
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:01.254
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3659
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 7>the great scientist,</v>

3660
01:47:02.851 --> 01:47:03.684
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3661
01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:04.381
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3662
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 7>that's been in the wheelchair.</v>

3663
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:06.443
<v Speaker 7>Hawking,</v>

3664
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.470
<v Speaker 7>hawking has stated that he wants to see everyone get off the planet.</v>

3665
01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:09.720
<v Speaker 7>He's,</v>

3666
01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.340
<v Speaker 7>he feels that we're already doomed.</v>

3667
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:12.271
<v Speaker 7>We have to get in,</v>

3668
01:47:12.271 --> 01:47:14.370
<v Speaker 7>populate it for the extension of the human species.</v>

3669
01:47:14.371 --> 01:47:18.210
<v Speaker 7>We have to populate another planet because there's no way we're going to survive</v>

3670
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 7>in this one based on what we're doing.</v>

3671
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:19.770
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

3672
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:22.950
<v Speaker 7>these are very smart people that think these ways.</v>

3673
01:47:22.951 --> 01:47:27.951
<v Speaker 7>So a smart people who are studying the human race as if we're studying a colony</v>

3674
01:47:28.171 --> 01:47:29.160
<v Speaker 7>of ants are studying.</v>

3675
01:47:29.161 --> 01:47:31.060
<v Speaker 7>Anything else that you can clearly see where the,</v>

3676
01:47:31.061 --> 01:47:31.850
<v Speaker 7>where they're headed.</v>

3677
01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:32.683
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3678
01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:36.030
<v Speaker 7>It's scary unlike anything.</v>

3679
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.080
<v Speaker 7>Is it natural?</v>

3680
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:39.180
<v Speaker 7>It's all natural.</v>

3681
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.530
<v Speaker 7>It is all natural.</v>

3682
01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 7>Natural that the,</v>

3683
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:44.334
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3684
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:44.790
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3685
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:45.623
<v Speaker 7>someone said this,</v>

3686
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 7>I believe it was Mckenna,</v>

3687
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.650
<v Speaker 7>that every parasite is a failed Sambia.</v>

3688
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:51.940
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

3689
01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3690
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:52.741
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3691
01:47:52.741 --> 01:47:57.630
<v Speaker 7>what they're all trying to do is find some sort of a mean,</v>

3692
01:47:57.631 --> 01:48:02.070
<v Speaker 7>every body is filled with other sorts of living organisms.</v>

3693
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 7>These living organisms,</v>

3694
01:48:03.901 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 7>they work together in synergy.</v>

3695
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:06.480
<v Speaker 7>They work together.</v>

3696
01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:07.563
<v Speaker 7>They're,</v>

3697
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:08.640
<v Speaker 7>they're symbiotic.</v>

3698
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.230
<v Speaker 7>And that every parasite is like one that didn't quite work out and just fucked</v>

3699
01:48:13.231 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 7>up and killed the host or jack the host,</v>

3700
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:17.010
<v Speaker 7>or does something terrible to those.</v>

3701
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:20.460
<v Speaker 7>Isn't it possible that that's what technology is?</v>

3702
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:23.130
<v Speaker 7>The technology is all sort of sort of some sort of a,</v>

3703
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:26.760
<v Speaker 7>it's some sort of a parasitic symbiotic thing where it's,</v>

3704
01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:28.920
<v Speaker 7>it's in the middle of,</v>

3705
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 7>in the middle of helping us.</v>

3706
01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:31.881
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3707
01:48:31.881 --> 01:48:34.650
<v Speaker 7>it's enlightening us and it's allowing us to,</v>

3708
01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.000
<v Speaker 7>to move forward.</v>

3709
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.290
<v Speaker 7>It's allowing us to,</v>

3710
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 7>to exchange information or rate never possible before.</v>

3711
01:48:40.081 --> 01:48:42.540
<v Speaker 7>But it's also when you,</v>

3712
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:45.330
<v Speaker 7>when you establish the highest levels of technology,</v>

3713
01:48:45.331 --> 01:48:50.190
<v Speaker 7>the often are destructive and it's going to feed the need for people to try that</v>

3714
01:48:50.191 --> 01:48:51.360
<v Speaker 7>shit out and use it.</v>

3715
01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:52.860
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3716
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 7>there's the flaw of the broad human psychology isn't this defense posture that</v>

3717
01:48:57.481 --> 01:48:57.721
<v Speaker 7>we've,</v>

3718
01:48:57.721 --> 01:48:59.010
<v Speaker 7>we've groomed so well.</v>

3719
01:48:59.480 --> 01:48:59.790
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3720
01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:01.320
<v Speaker 7>it's not the technology that's the problem.</v>

3721
01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:03.620
<v Speaker 7>It's the fucking people behind the technology store.</v>

3722
01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:04.301
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

3723
01:49:04.301 --> 01:49:04.470
<v Speaker 7>Let,</v>

3724
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.651
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3725
01:49:04.651 --> 01:49:05.484
<v Speaker 7>isn't it,</v>

3726
01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean it,</v>

3727
01:49:06.570 --> 01:49:09.340
<v Speaker 7>is it almost inevitable that we,</v>

3728
01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:10.140
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

3729
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.580
<v Speaker 7>with this kind of power,</v>

3730
01:49:11.581 --> 01:49:13.170
<v Speaker 7>we will have this kind of behavior.</v>

3731
01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.960
<v Speaker 7>Is it almost inevitable that with ultimate power like that?</v>

3732
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:16.680
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3733
01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 7>if there isn't a very dramatic change in the way people think about themselves</v>

3734
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:21.840
<v Speaker 7>and how they relate to the world,</v>

3735
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.250
<v Speaker 7>it seems inevitable to me.</v>

3736
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 7>How did you develop this line of thinking?</v>

3737
01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:27.540
<v Speaker 7>Did you have some sort of a,</v>

3738
01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 7>a life changing experience where you're always like,</v>

3739
01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 7>this just had great influences from,</v>

3740
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:34.430
<v Speaker 7>from Carl Sagan too,</v>

3741
01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:40.530
<v Speaker 7>to even even George Carlin and Bill Hicks and the comedy spectrum coupled with</v>

3742
01:49:40.891 --> 01:49:41.940
<v Speaker 7>the scientific community.</v>

3743
01:49:41.941 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 7>It was very influential with me,</v>

3744
01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:45.900
<v Speaker 7>both from a cultural standpoint and a progressive standpoint,</v>

3745
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 7>if there's any that's most influential would have been Carl Sagan as far as</v>

3746
01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:54.220
<v Speaker 7>values because he was so in line the guy and he smoked weed every day Sun.</v>

3747
01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:58.390
<v Speaker 7>Which know that I didn't know that Carl Sagan would smoke weed and just think</v>

3748
01:49:58.391 --> 01:49:59.224
<v Speaker 7>about space.</v>

3749
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:00.371
<v Speaker 7>It's what he did.</v>

3750
01:50:00.371 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 7>And he wrote some brute beautiful,</v>

3751
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:03.940
<v Speaker 7>eloquent essays on cannabis use.</v>

3752
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.370
<v Speaker 7>Did it.</v>

3753
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:05.190
<v Speaker 7>And I wasn't aware of that.</v>

3754
01:50:05.190 --> 01:50:05.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3755
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 7>it was brilliant golf [inaudible] seconds.</v>

3756
01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:07.774
<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>

3757
01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:08.500
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

3758
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.120
<v Speaker 7>it's a long value shift and I,</v>

3759
01:50:10.121 --> 01:50:10.331
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3760
01:50:10.331 --> 01:50:13.270
<v Speaker 7>I went through the same stuff of anger and everything else and I think a lot of</v>

3761
01:50:13.271 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 7>people do.</v>

3762
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:17.500
<v Speaker 7>And then I met even more people that fascinated me and a lot of authors,</v>

3763
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 7>there's so many brilliant minds out there from Joc Fresco at Buckminster Fuller</v>

3764
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:23.410
<v Speaker 7>to Nicola frescoes.</v>

3765
01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.180
<v Speaker 7>The guidance ahead of that Venus project,</v>

3766
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:25.961
<v Speaker 7>is that who he is,</v>

3767
01:50:25.961 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 7>the director of the Venus project.</v>

3768
01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:27.430
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3769
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:28.850
<v Speaker 7>And the Venus project is,</v>

3770
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:30.460
<v Speaker 7>explain that to me cause they,</v>

3771
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.191
<v Speaker 7>this is a,</v>

3772
01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:34.450
<v Speaker 7>they are a resource based economy and is probably,</v>

3773
01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:34.901
<v Speaker 7>it is a,</v>

3774
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 7>is a,</v>

3775
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 7>is a concept,</v>

3776
01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 7>a encapsulated concept put forward by Jock,</v>

3777
01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:41.650
<v Speaker 7>which goes farther than a train of thought.</v>

3778
01:50:41.651 --> 01:50:45.100
<v Speaker 7>It actually in Po design actually has design issues that he's come up with</v>

3779
01:50:45.101 --> 01:50:45.671
<v Speaker 7>throughout the years.</v>

3780
01:50:45.671 --> 01:50:48.010
<v Speaker 7>He's about 95 now and very brilliant,</v>

3781
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 7>very brilliant guy.</v>

3782
01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:54.810
<v Speaker 7>They basically are promoting very specific systems and the zeitgeists movement</v>

3783
01:50:54.851 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 7>promotes long trains of thought without being specific to a design.</v>

3784
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:00.430
<v Speaker 7>We used to be in partnership,</v>

3785
01:51:00.431 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 7>the Venus project in the zeitgeists movement and you guys fell apart.</v>

3786
01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.750
<v Speaker 7>There was a falling out there unfortunately.</v>

3787
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:05.613
<v Speaker 7>What happened?</v>

3788
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:06.581
<v Speaker 7>Hard to explain,</v>

3789
01:51:06.581 --> 01:51:11.581
<v Speaker 7>it was a kind of a personality dropoff of motivations of code for Hippie Pussy.</v>

3790
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.391
<v Speaker 7>That's what it was.</v>

3791
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:15.940
<v Speaker 7>They were fighting over Hippie Pussy Jack Fresco's.</v>

3792
01:51:15.941 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 7>You should be at the top of the heap when you're 95 years old.</v>

3793
01:51:18.671 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 7>You've been doing this forever and this young whippersnapper comes along making</v>

3794
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 7>it's fucking films like pitch.</v>

3795
01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 7>I've got a map,</v>

3796
01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:24.490
<v Speaker 7>I've got a map for the future.</v>

3797
01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.051
<v Speaker 7>So this,</v>

3798
01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3799
01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:29.590
<v Speaker 7>he's very specific as far as like engineering,</v>

3800
01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:31.000
<v Speaker 7>this sort of a society,</v>

3801
01:51:31.001 --> 01:51:32.860
<v Speaker 7>industrial designer and social engineer.</v>

3802
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:33.291
<v Speaker 7>Ah,</v>

3803
01:51:33.291 --> 01:51:37.300
<v Speaker 7>so he spent a great deal of time doing it and it's just like Buckminster Fuller,</v>

3804
01:51:37.301 --> 01:51:38.740
<v Speaker 7>which I think is a good counterpart.</v>

3805
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 7>These are prominent guys that have really tried to push forward with new ideas</v>

3806
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 7>and many different genres.</v>

3807
01:51:44.250 --> 01:51:46.750
<v Speaker 7>Not to mention approaches to the entire social system.</v>

3808
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

3809
01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3810
01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:48.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3811
01:51:48.511 --> 01:51:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I watch a lot of things online and when I sit in front of it,</v>

3812
01:51:53.131 --> 01:51:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I do tooth.</v>

3813
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:54.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

3814
01:51:54.411 --> 01:51:54.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3815
01:51:54.610 --> 01:51:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I absorb whatever someone's putting out.</v>

3816
01:51:57.181 --> 01:51:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course I listened to their message,</v>

3817
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.120
<v Speaker 1>but I also,</v>

3818
01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:02.700
<v Speaker 1>when I see something like what Chunk Fresco is saying,</v>

3819
01:52:02.701 --> 01:52:02.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3820
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look at it as if I was someone.</v>

3821
01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:07.643
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3822
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I was someone who is in some sort of a position of power in government.</v>

3823
01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:14.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3824
01:52:14.161 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I was someone who was in some sort of a position of power,</v>

3825
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:17.600
<v Speaker 1>of political influence,</v>

3826
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3827
01:52:18.001 --> 01:52:18.721
<v Speaker 1>running the banks,</v>

3828
01:52:18.721 --> 01:52:19.411
<v Speaker 1>running the world,</v>

3829
01:52:19.411 --> 01:52:20.340
<v Speaker 1>the IMF,</v>

3830
01:52:20.341 --> 01:52:22.200
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck it is that pulls the strings for the world.</v>

3831
01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.041
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

3832
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:24.240
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal with this guy?</v>

3833
01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:25.350
<v Speaker 1>What do I,</v>

3834
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.920
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

3835
01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:27.210
<v Speaker 1>does this guy a problem?</v>

3836
01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy ever going to be for real?</v>

3837
01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Is this ever going to be an issue that I have to deal with this,</v>

3838
01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.551
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

3839
01:52:32.551 --> 01:52:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and debate him as to how the world's resources should be used?</v>

3840
01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:36.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3841
01:52:36.361 --> 01:52:37.194
<v Speaker 1>is this a,</v>

3842
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:39.780
<v Speaker 1>is that a concern for a guy like that?</v>

3843
01:52:39.781 --> 01:52:40.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3844
01:52:40.021 --> 01:52:41.010
<v Speaker 1>do you use,</v>

3845
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:45.500
<v Speaker 1>do you think that a guy like him or like you do you guys have to with</v>

3846
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:47.690
<v Speaker 7>someone?</v>

3847
01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 7>It depends on how far we go.</v>

3848
01:52:48.891 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 7>I think anyone in the,</v>

3849
01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.260
<v Speaker 7>you think that right?</v>

3850
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 7>Do you think like as far as like moving forward,</v>

3851
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:53.151
<v Speaker 7>let me give,</v>

3852
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:55.910
<v Speaker 7>you did buy the land and get the people to start living there.</v>

3853
01:52:56.150 --> 01:52:57.260
<v Speaker 7>That's when you would have an issue.</v>

3854
01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:57.460
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3855
01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:58.011
<v Speaker 7>well I don't,</v>

3856
01:52:58.011 --> 01:52:58.311
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

3857
01:52:58.311 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 7>I don't advocate such a thing.</v>

3858
01:52:59.421 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 7>I don't advocate running from this system big is your file the FBI file?</v>

3859
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:03.344
<v Speaker 7>They have idea.</v>

3860
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 7>If you had to guess.</v>

3861
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was fucking massive.</v>

3862
01:53:06.231 --> 01:53:06.590
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3863
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:07.221
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3864
01:53:07.221 --> 01:53:10.040
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you don't care if you started running your very young right</v>

3865
01:53:10.041 --> 01:53:10.281
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

3866
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:11.114
<v Speaker 7>Like how old are you?</v>

3867
01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:12.400
<v Speaker 7>39 no,</v>

3868
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 7>30 to 32 that's amazing.</v>

3869
01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.320
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3870
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.940
<v Speaker 7>you're 32 that's incredible.</v>

3871
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 7>So when you came out with the first site guys,</v>

3872
01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:19.334
<v Speaker 7>how old were you?</v>

3873
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 7>When I was four years ago.</v>

3874
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 7>So it was 20 holy Shit.</v>

3875
01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 7>So you were in your twenties when you put that together.</v>

3876
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:26.010
<v Speaker 7>That's a very unusual man.</v>

3877
01:53:26.011 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 7>And you're a very unusual talker.</v>

3878
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:27.821
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3879
01:53:27.821 --> 01:53:27.970
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

3880
01:53:27.970 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 7>if you're only 29 that's what you said.</v>

3881
01:53:30.351 --> 01:53:34.370
<v Speaker 7>32 32 32 so that's very unusual man.</v>

3882
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:35.120
<v Speaker 7>So what does it,</v>

3883
01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.730
<v Speaker 7>what do you have to be to be president 36 something like that.</v>

3884
01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.760
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to be president,</v>

3885
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.380
<v Speaker 7>but now,</v>

3886
01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.270
<v Speaker 7>but we for real,</v>

3887
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 7>you say that there's someone come along.</v>

3888
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:45.010
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe in the system that I don't believe in.</v>

3889
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 7>The system changes a little bit.</v>

3890
01:53:46.851 --> 01:53:47.331
<v Speaker 7>Listen man,</v>

3891
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 7>you could run this shit.</v>

3892
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.160
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3893
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.980
<v Speaker 7>the next project is something called the global redesign institute,</v>

3894
01:53:51.981 --> 01:53:53.450
<v Speaker 7>which can be a nonprofit I'm founding,</v>

3895
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 7>which is going to basically take artists and engineers,</v>

3896
01:53:56.001 --> 01:53:59.340
<v Speaker 7>get them together to show how to redesign and the infrastructure.</v>

3897
01:53:59.341 --> 01:54:02.750
<v Speaker 7>But for particular regions in the most sustainable nonmonetary,</v>

3898
01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:03.531
<v Speaker 7>most sustainable,</v>

3899
01:54:03.531 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 7>practical and efficient way possible.</v>

3900
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:06.201
<v Speaker 7>So for example,</v>

3901
01:54:06.201 --> 01:54:07.340
<v Speaker 7>you could take Los Angeles,</v>

3902
01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:10.280
<v Speaker 7>you could show the public and conference it completely new,</v>

3903
01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:12.740
<v Speaker 7>redesigned that didn't say have cars sitting at a gas,</v>

3904
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.401
<v Speaker 7>excuse me,</v>

3905
01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:14.810
<v Speaker 7>sitting at stop lights,</v>

3906
01:54:14.811 --> 01:54:14.991
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3907
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:15.741
<v Speaker 7>wasting gas.</v>

3908
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:16.850
<v Speaker 7>How much gas is based in,</v>

3909
01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 7>but the inefficiency of the stoplight system,</v>

3910
01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 7>at least Europe has those roundabouts semi better.</v>

3911
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 7>But you could think of all sorts of creative means up and over systems.</v>

3912
01:54:25.190 --> 01:54:25.431
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3913
01:54:25.431 --> 01:54:28.520
<v Speaker 7>a lot of cars they stop and they shut off actually at red lights.</v>

3914
01:54:28.521 --> 01:54:28.970
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

3915
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:29.750
<v Speaker 7>That's good.</v>

3916
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:30.381
<v Speaker 7>That's smart.</v>

3917
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:31.011
<v Speaker 7>But then when you leave,</v>

3918
01:54:31.011 --> 01:54:32.030
<v Speaker 7>when you want off the gas,</v>

3919
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:32.864
<v Speaker 7>they start again.</v>

3920
01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:33.701
<v Speaker 7>New Technology.</v>

3921
01:54:33.701 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 7>I've seen that with a couple with batteries stuff.</v>

3922
01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:35.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3923
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:36.051
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3924
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:37.670
<v Speaker 7>It's a engines as well.</v>

3925
01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.330
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3926
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 7>so the machine engine,</v>

3927
01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:41.490
<v Speaker 7>we see how the concept of efficiency is,</v>

3928
01:54:41.491 --> 01:54:45.020
<v Speaker 7>is vast pressure transducers and streets that can power the lights.</v>

3929
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:45.270
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3930
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 7>he'd grab pressure transducers and these walls that could help power the</v>

3931
01:54:48.171 --> 01:54:49.910
<v Speaker 7>lighting system in the building.</v>

3932
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 7>There's so many things that could be applied to society to make it so grandiose,</v>

3933
01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.200
<v Speaker 7>efficient that would rule out the market system by default.</v>

3934
01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 7>But it would solve so many problems of poverty and hunger and even conflict and</v>

3935
01:55:01.371 --> 01:55:03.830
<v Speaker 7>petty crime and most crimes related to money.</v>

3936
01:55:03.831 --> 01:55:03.951
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3937
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 7>you can eliminate so many massive things,</v>

3938
01:55:05.661 --> 01:55:08.810
<v Speaker 7>not a utopia if you just applied the most efficient means.</v>

3939
01:55:08.811 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 7>And give people,</v>

3940
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3941
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:13.250
<v Speaker 7>vertical farms with the coast of Los Angeles running d sound as processes from</v>

3942
01:55:13.251 --> 01:55:14.390
<v Speaker 7>the water boom,</v>

3943
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 7>organic vertical farms feed everyone locally.</v>

3944
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.380
<v Speaker 7>Forget globalization.</v>

3945
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:20.690
<v Speaker 7>Think of how much energy is wasted on globalization,</v>

3946
01:55:20.691 --> 01:55:21.760
<v Speaker 7>moving shit back and forth.</v>

3947
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:22.820
<v Speaker 7>Product made here in China,</v>

3948
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.500
<v Speaker 7>assembled over here in Uganda.</v>

3949
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.911
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3950
01:55:24.911 --> 01:55:25.551
<v Speaker 7>it's nuts.</v>

3951
01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:26.384
<v Speaker 7>What we're doing.</v>

3952
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 7>When you take that stand point,</v>

3953
01:55:27.711 --> 01:55:28.760
<v Speaker 7>you begin to see how yes,</v>

3954
01:55:28.761 --> 01:55:30.140
<v Speaker 7>you can feed everybody on this planet.</v>

3955
01:55:30.141 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 7>You can have everyone having access abundance.</v>

3956
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:32.990
<v Speaker 7>We call it on this planet.</v>

3957
01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:35.060
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean you have everything you want.</v>

3958
01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.410
<v Speaker 7>That's impossible.</v>

3959
01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 7>The very idea of having everything possible,</v>

3960
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:39.700
<v Speaker 7>which is the catalyst,</v>

3961
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.730
<v Speaker 7>everybody can't be the salt.</v>

3962
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:41.564
<v Speaker 7>Number nine,</v>

3963
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:44.520
<v Speaker 7>well everyone can have a 50 room mansion or two jets parked in the front lawn.</v>

3964
01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:45.840
<v Speaker 7>That's actually an act of violence.</v>

3965
01:55:45.841 --> 01:55:46.651
<v Speaker 7>If you think about it,</v>

3966
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 7>social violence,</v>

3967
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.610
<v Speaker 7>it is.</v>

3968
01:55:48.610 --> 01:55:51.120
<v Speaker 7>There's an act of violence to think that way because you're the amount of</v>

3969
01:55:51.121 --> 01:55:53.220
<v Speaker 7>deprivation you're imposing on somebody else.</v>

3970
01:55:53.221 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 7>By that acquisition of resources,</v>

3971
01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 7>which was so excessive is in fact inhibiting other people's lives one way or</v>

3972
01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.184
<v Speaker 7>another.</v>

3973
01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.053
<v Speaker 7>So wait a minute.</v>

3974
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:02.550
<v Speaker 7>By having a jet or whatever,</v>

3975
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:05.460
<v Speaker 7>how big that is of such an such access.</v>

3976
01:56:05.461 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 7>And you can be subjective on this,</v>

3977
01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:08.580
<v Speaker 7>but anything that has no utility,</v>

3978
01:56:08.581 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 7>it's of such access and vanity such as one guy living with his small family and</v>

3979
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:17.880
<v Speaker 7>a 40 room mansion and having to massive gas guzzling jets parked in the front</v>

3980
01:56:17.881 --> 01:56:19.770
<v Speaker 7>lawn just because he can.</v>

3981
01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.540
<v Speaker 7>Who does that Travolta Travolta.</v>

3982
01:56:21.630 --> 01:56:22.360
<v Speaker 7>Does he do that?</v>

3983
01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.170
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

3984
01:56:23.170 --> 01:56:23.881
<v Speaker 7>Well listen,</v>

3985
01:56:23.881 --> 01:56:27.500
<v Speaker 7>you got to fly that Dick in from all over the world to make sure,</v>

3986
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.140
<v Speaker 7>but we'll have to keep quiet fox magic and he goes so far,</v>

3987
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:32.250
<v Speaker 7>I get that argument though.</v>

3988
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:32.941
<v Speaker 7>Someone says to me,</v>

3989
01:56:32.941 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 7>well I don't like your system cause what if I want to have four Ferrari's as</v>

3990
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:38.100
<v Speaker 7>though that's a utility need.</v>

3991
01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:39.150
<v Speaker 7>It's a complete value orientation.</v>

3992
01:56:39.151 --> 01:56:39.331
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>

3993
01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 7>well what if I want to have Africa is my backyard?</v>

3994
01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.653
<v Speaker 7>Is that okay?</v>

3995
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 7>What if I want to block off Africa?</v>

3996
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:45.440
<v Speaker 7>Africa is might be,</v>

3997
01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.440
<v Speaker 7>that's this form can buy Africa if you have so much money that you could slowly</v>

3998
01:56:49.441 --> 01:56:51.090
<v Speaker 7>buy up the entirety of Africa.</v>

3999
01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.650
<v Speaker 7>But you see the point by Africa.</v>

4000
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:53.551
<v Speaker 7>So is there a,</v>

4001
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:57.040
<v Speaker 7>is this a competitive society as their competition in this society?</v>

4002
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.100
<v Speaker 7>Competition would be within one square development,</v>

4003
01:56:59.101 --> 01:57:01.800
<v Speaker 7>which is when real competition is about accelerating yourself,</v>

4004
01:57:01.801 --> 01:57:02.940
<v Speaker 7>not against somebody else.</v>

4005
01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:03.361
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4006
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:07.550
<v Speaker 7>I could completely see how people in like a sports it advanced society and like</v>

4007
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.440
<v Speaker 7>a sports context,</v>

4008
01:57:08.441 --> 01:57:10.470
<v Speaker 7>they're not really thinking about beating somebody else.</v>

4009
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.910
<v Speaker 7>They thinking about beating themselves,</v>

4010
01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:14.010
<v Speaker 7>thinking of improving their own betterment.</v>

4011
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:15.010
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't become something.</v>

4012
01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.710
<v Speaker 7>The process somebody gets beaten up.</v>

4013
01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:17.760
<v Speaker 7>That is a lot of the,</v>

4014
01:57:17.761 --> 01:57:19.200
<v Speaker 7>a lot of the motivation,</v>

4015
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:19.391
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4016
01:57:19.391 --> 01:57:20.520
<v Speaker 7>if you ever talked to anybody,</v>

4017
01:57:20.521 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 7>very competitive,</v>

4018
01:57:21.710 --> 01:57:24.690
<v Speaker 7>it's not just about them performing at their best,</v>

4019
01:57:24.691 --> 01:57:25.524
<v Speaker 7>it's about winning.</v>

4020
01:57:25.670 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure it is.</v>

4021
01:57:26.250 --> 01:57:26.521
<v Speaker 7>Sure it is.</v>

4022
01:57:26.521 --> 01:57:27.570
<v Speaker 7>If that's what the culture be enforced,</v>

4023
01:57:27.571 --> 01:57:30.420
<v Speaker 7>everything's about winning culture definitely reinforces it.</v>

4024
01:57:30.421 --> 01:57:31.051
<v Speaker 7>But it's also,</v>

4025
01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:33.780
<v Speaker 7>I think a piece piece of human nature is involved in that as well.</v>

4026
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:34.950
<v Speaker 7>It's two universal.</v>

4027
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 7>It's not just this culture.</v>

4028
01:57:36.271 --> 01:57:39.420
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty much any culture where any sort of competition starts going.</v>

4029
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.051
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4030
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:40.471
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

4031
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 7>people want to win.</v>

4032
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.361
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4033
01:57:42.361 --> 01:57:42.751
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

4034
01:57:42.751 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 7>it's a natural thing and I think it might be one of the reasons why it's driven</v>

4035
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:49.680
<v Speaker 7>innovation to such a radical tipping point.</v>

4036
01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:52.920
<v Speaker 7>You talked to anyone who knew Steve jobs or anybody who knows Bill Gates.</v>

4037
01:57:52.921 --> 01:57:55.830
<v Speaker 7>One of the things I'll tell you is how incredibly competitive these guys are.</v>

4038
01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:57.000
<v Speaker 7>Very competitive.</v>

4039
01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.130
<v Speaker 7>I think it exists on a different level though,</v>

4040
01:57:59.131 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 7>and it was a lot of flexibility to it.</v>

4041
01:58:00.541 --> 01:58:02.700
<v Speaker 7>I'm not denying that it exists,</v>

4042
01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 7>but for me,</v>

4043
01:58:03.541 --> 01:58:03.660
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

4044
01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:04.590
<v Speaker 7>I'm not competitive.</v>

4045
01:58:04.591 --> 01:58:05.900
<v Speaker 7>I have no interest in the,</v>

4046
01:58:06.130 --> 01:58:08.130
<v Speaker 7>but you're also not the head of Microsoft.</v>

4047
01:58:08.610 --> 01:58:09.870
<v Speaker 7>You're not putting out computers.</v>

4048
01:58:09.871 --> 01:58:10.441
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4049
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:10.741
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4050
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:12.390
<v Speaker 7>done an amazing thing creatively.</v>

4051
01:58:12.391 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 7>But in order to push innovation,</v>

4052
01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:18.180
<v Speaker 7>in order to push a company to push success and achievement,</v>

4053
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:21.460
<v Speaker 7>if you must feel like you have to have some sort of a sense of competitive on a</v>

4054
01:58:21.461 --> 01:58:22.860
<v Speaker 7>market system in variable,</v>

4055
01:58:22.861 --> 01:58:23.581
<v Speaker 7>you have to be competitive.</v>

4056
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:24.414
<v Speaker 7>If you're going to fail,</v>

4057
01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:25.380
<v Speaker 7>you're gonna fail financially.</v>

4058
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:26.490
<v Speaker 7>You're going to fail in your status.</v>

4059
01:58:26.491 --> 01:58:29.910
<v Speaker 7>If you look at Steve jobs writings and his talks and the guy was a very creative</v>

4060
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:32.220
<v Speaker 7>individual that you could tell that as money aside.</v>

4061
01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 7>He wasn't motivated by that incentive for one.</v>

4062
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:35.760
<v Speaker 7>And I think his interest to be competitive,</v>

4063
01:58:35.761 --> 01:58:40.350
<v Speaker 7>it was really just to make the best he could for whatever demographic or concept</v>

4064
01:58:40.351 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 7>or idea and of course to compete against Microsoft</v>

4065
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:43.900
<v Speaker 5>to make sure he maintains his market share.</v>

4066
01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:46.810
<v Speaker 5>So competition is inherent to the game that they're playing.</v>

4067
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:47.081
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4068
01:58:47.081 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's my point.</v>

4069
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.903
<v Speaker 5>Who knows though,</v>

4070
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:49.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4071
01:58:49.710 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 5>am I competitive with other people?</v>

4072
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:56.911
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the context of and also the conditioning within that context of</v>

4073
01:58:57.011 --> 01:58:57.844
<v Speaker 5>what I'm doing.</v>

4074
01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:00.430
<v Speaker 5>If I have to survive and have to go into a fight with somebody,</v>

4075
01:59:00.431 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 5>well that's an obvious competition.</v>

4076
01:59:02.110 --> 01:59:04.090
<v Speaker 5>That's something that my life might depend upon.</v>

4077
01:59:04.091 --> 01:59:07.930
<v Speaker 5>So obviously there's something ingrained there that means we respond that way.</v>

4078
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:08.471
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

4079
01:59:08.471 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 5>back to the,</v>

4080
01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4081
01:59:09.101 --> 01:59:09.301
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4082
01:59:09.301 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 5>the later existence of the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

4083
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:13.030
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to operate that.</v>

4084
01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:15.820
<v Speaker 5>When someone goes into a bar and steps on my foot or insults my girlfriend,</v>

4085
01:59:15.821 --> 01:59:17.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to beat the shit out of him.</v>

4086
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I could say,</v>

4087
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

4088
01:59:18.430 --> 01:59:19.270
<v Speaker 5>there's another dip shit,</v>

4089
01:59:19.690 --> 01:59:22.690
<v Speaker 5>one of many and walk away or I can save.</v>

4090
01:59:22.691 --> 01:59:23.740
<v Speaker 5>There's another victim of cultures,</v>

4091
01:59:23.741 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of responses that we could have that are not based on that reaction.</v>

4092
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4093
01:59:27.221 --> 01:59:28.600
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly a lot of fights.</v>

4094
01:59:28.601 --> 01:59:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to void.</v>

4095
01:59:29.250 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I was having that conversation with someone today.</v>

4096
01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4097
01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4098
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 1>avoid everything you can.</v>

4099
01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 1>If you can get out of something,</v>

4100
01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:37.510
<v Speaker 1>talk to someone and get out of it.</v>

4101
01:59:37.511 --> 01:59:37.991
<v Speaker 1>Get out of it.</v>

4102
01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:40.030
<v Speaker 1>What are you crazy and you want to get in fights with people.</v>

4103
01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:40.401
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4104
01:59:40.401 --> 01:59:41.234
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

4105
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:44.240
<v Speaker 5>This guy interviewed James Giligan who was like guy moving forward.</v>

4106
01:59:44.250 --> 01:59:45.083
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the most,</v>

4107
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.641
<v Speaker 5>one of the most,</v>

4108
01:59:46.641 --> 01:59:47.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4109
01:59:47.090 --> 01:59:47.211
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4110
01:59:47.211 --> 01:59:51.860
<v Speaker 5>claimed a criminal psychologist and he would talk about shame and the issues of</v>

4111
01:59:51.861 --> 01:59:55.880
<v Speaker 5>shame and why people behave so violently spent his whole life analyzing violent</v>

4112
01:59:55.881 --> 01:59:56.361
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>

4113
01:59:56.361 --> 01:59:59.960
<v Speaker 5>Grave gave a great insight into serial killers and a lot of people that you</v>

4114
01:59:59.961 --> 02:00:01.580
<v Speaker 5>think are natural outgrowths,</v>

4115
02:00:01.581 --> 02:00:04.160
<v Speaker 5>they're just typical of the system or typical of humanity,</v>

4116
02:00:04.161 --> 02:00:04.994
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

4117
02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:06.950
<v Speaker 5>and he found it on those throughout the entire thing.</v>

4118
02:00:06.951 --> 02:00:09.080
<v Speaker 5>It was based on a form of humiliation and shame,</v>

4119
02:00:09.081 --> 02:00:12.590
<v Speaker 5>and what was so fascinating is that the majority of the instances of violence</v>

4120
02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:15.200
<v Speaker 5>happened in the most mundane and arbitrary circumstances.</v>

4121
02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:16.250
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't life threatening.</v>

4122
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Someone would literally insult somebody else and they would get really upset by</v>

4123
02:00:20.661 --> 02:00:25.370
<v Speaker 5>that and the shame that they would feel from being so small from getting upset</v>

4124
02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:26.031
<v Speaker 5>from someone saying,</v>

4125
02:00:26.031 --> 02:00:26.864
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

4126
02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:31.320
<v Speaker 5>caused that much more reinforcement of their anger to get into a physical brawl.</v>

4127
02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:32.211
<v Speaker 5>It was fascinating.</v>

4128
02:00:32.211 --> 02:00:33.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a fascinating subject.</v>

4129
02:00:33.141 --> 02:00:35.440
<v Speaker 5>I recommend anyone that's interested in violent behavior to look up.</v>

4130
02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:36.293
<v Speaker 5>James Giligan.</v>

4131
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4132
02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4133
02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I am a huge student of human nature,</v>

4134
02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>especially human contact and conflict and aggression and retrain as a fighter,</v>

4135
02:00:46.591 --> 02:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4136
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:47.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4137
02:00:47.041 --> 02:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I've done martial arts my whole life and I think that's a huge part of being a</v>

4138
02:00:51.451 --> 02:00:52.284
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

4139
02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I think every man,</v>

4140
02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have to deal with some form of aggression in your life,</v>

4141
02:00:57.271 --> 02:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to ultimately worry or wonder what happens if this becomes</v>

4142
02:01:00.781 --> 02:01:01.614
<v Speaker 1>physical.</v>

4143
02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think taking that off the table and learning martial arts as it just as</v>

4144
02:01:05.521 --> 02:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>the animal human being is a great way to prevent m.</v>

4145
02:01:08.731 --> 02:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Anybody ever fighting?</v>

4146
02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a fight at a Dojo.</v>

4147
02:01:12.630 --> 02:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a fight at a,</v>

4148
02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>at a Jujitsu gym.</v>

4149
02:01:15.031 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a fight.</v>

4150
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

4151
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

4152
02:01:17.610 --> 02:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a fight between fighters.</v>

4153
02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4154
02:01:20.541 --> 02:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Mo for the most part,</v>

4155
02:01:21.810 --> 02:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>most fighters they can communicate better because they know that they don't want</v>

4156
02:01:26.401 --> 02:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>to fight.</v>

4157
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't have anything to prove.</v>

4158
02:01:27.991 --> 02:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>They know exactly what they can</v>

4159
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:29.551
<v Speaker 5>look at.</v>

4160
02:01:29.551 --> 02:01:30.840
<v Speaker 5>The philosophy of Bruce Lee.</v>

4161
02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:31.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4162
02:01:31.501 --> 02:01:32.290
<v Speaker 5>he was amazing.</v>

4163
02:01:32.290 --> 02:01:32.681
<v Speaker 1>There's a few,</v>

4164
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been a few brawls post-fight brawls cause the people get an</v>

4165
02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>emotional and there's a famous one on cvs a while back where mayhem Miller and</v>

4166
02:01:39.831 --> 02:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>the Diaz brothers went at it on CBS.</v>

4167
02:01:42.011 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of ridiculous.</v>

4168
02:01:43.130 --> 02:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4169
02:01:44.181 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the most part though,</v>

4170
02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>the amount of altercations that you're going to get if you're hanging around</v>

4171
02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>train martial artists are way fewer,</v>

4172
02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:52.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4173
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>a amongst themselves,</v>

4174
02:01:54.381 --> 02:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>they're very rare and it either you put them amongst any other group of athletic</v>

4175
02:01:58.551 --> 02:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>aggressive individuals,</v>

4176
02:01:59.581 --> 02:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have much more conflict.</v>

4177
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I think you take it off the table once you,</v>

4178
02:02:03.531 --> 02:02:03.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4179
02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>address it and you understand it.</v>

4180
02:02:05.121 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like with a lot of people,</v>

4181
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the idea of kicking someone's ass really a big part of it is that they don't</v>

4182
02:02:10.641 --> 02:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>want their own ass kicked.</v>

4183
02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:13.101
<v Speaker 1>It's a fear.</v>

4184
02:02:13.101 --> 02:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like an overconfidence</v>

4185
02:02:14.970 --> 02:02:15.990
<v Speaker 5>initial fear.</v>

4186
02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:16.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4187
02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:16.471
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4188
02:02:16.471 --> 02:02:17.100
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

4189
02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:17.371
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

4190
02:02:17.371 --> 02:02:18.204
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

4191
02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>We need to figure this fucking thing out.</v>

4192
02:02:20.041 --> 02:02:20.790
<v Speaker 5>Peter Joseph,</v>

4193
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:21.623
<v Speaker 5>goddammit,</v>

4194
02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:22.920
<v Speaker 5>we're closing in on it.</v>

4195
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:24.990
<v Speaker 5>We're clone is closing in on some,</v>

4196
02:02:24.991 --> 02:02:25.681
<v Speaker 5>some real,</v>

4197
02:02:25.681 --> 02:02:26.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4198
02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:27.210
<v Speaker 5>interesting lessons.</v>

4199
02:02:27.330 --> 02:02:27.451
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4200
02:02:27.451 --> 02:02:28.140
<v Speaker 5>if you want them,</v>

4201
02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I can go back to your question,</v>

4202
02:02:29.790 --> 02:02:33.450
<v Speaker 5>I guess from like 20 minutes ago regarding what the system would be if I was the</v>

4203
02:02:33.451 --> 02:02:34.284
<v Speaker 5>leader of it,</v>

4204
02:02:34.290 --> 02:02:35.760
<v Speaker 5>which is a farce notion,</v>

4205
02:02:35.761 --> 02:02:36.800
<v Speaker 5>but what would the firing,</v>

4206
02:02:36.810 --> 02:02:38.400
<v Speaker 5>I said King,</v>

4207
02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:39.630
<v Speaker 5>what would,</v>

4208
02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:42.000
<v Speaker 5>what would define a new value system?</v>

4209
02:02:42.001 --> 02:02:44.400
<v Speaker 5>What would define a new sense of operation and if you track,</v>

4210
02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:46.080
<v Speaker 5>you track a fundamental train of thought.</v>

4211
02:02:46.081 --> 02:02:47.760
<v Speaker 5>You arrive at a series of conclusions.</v>

4212
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.090
<v Speaker 5>The first is he get rid of the property system as we know it and you create an</v>

4213
02:02:51.091 --> 02:02:52.020
<v Speaker 5>access system.</v>

4214
02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:54.270
<v Speaker 5>Best example is the Zipcar New York.</v>

4215
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.133
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

4216
02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:55.661
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

4217
02:02:55.661 --> 02:02:56.494
<v Speaker 5>I love the ZIP car.</v>

4218
02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:57.151
<v Speaker 5>People don't know.</v>

4219
02:02:57.151 --> 02:02:57.661
<v Speaker 5>Explain it.</v>

4220
02:02:57.661 --> 02:02:58.070
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

4221
02:02:58.070 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 5>Zipcar is just a rental car that's very easily accessible.</v>

4222
02:03:00.861 --> 02:03:02.820
<v Speaker 5>It would be special keys and they come and they'll,</v>

4223
02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:07.170
<v Speaker 5>they'll drop the car off or they'll leave it at a place that's close to you.</v>

4224
02:03:07.171 --> 02:03:08.400
<v Speaker 5>It's all proximity oriented,</v>

4225
02:03:08.401 --> 02:03:12.150
<v Speaker 5>computer generated and basically you can have a car and drive it and then return</v>

4226
02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:14.970
<v Speaker 5>it and it's like a rental car except it's more convenient.</v>

4227
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:15.991
<v Speaker 5>That's beautiful.</v>

4228
02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Most people's cars sit and driveways for the majority of their life.</v>

4229
02:03:18.630 --> 02:03:19.560
<v Speaker 5>That's a great idea.</v>

4230
02:03:19.561 --> 02:03:24.561
<v Speaker 5>Access access system versus a system of property is the most efficient concept</v>

4231
02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:25.771
<v Speaker 5>of social,</v>

4232
02:03:25.771 --> 02:03:26.101
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

4233
02:03:26.101 --> 02:03:27.120
<v Speaker 5>of environmental management.</v>

4234
02:03:27.121 --> 02:03:27.954
<v Speaker 5>You can have think about it.</v>

4235
02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:29.700
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid for everyone.</v>

4236
02:03:29.701 --> 02:03:29.851
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

4237
02:03:29.851 --> 02:03:32.550
<v Speaker 5>I've so much film equipment stuffed in like closets.</v>

4238
02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:33.900
<v Speaker 5>I would love to just to rent it,</v>

4239
02:03:33.901 --> 02:03:35.460
<v Speaker 5>but I can't do it cause I had no value.</v>

4240
02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:36.570
<v Speaker 5>I have to get to resell it.</v>

4241
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:39.210
<v Speaker 5>I'd spend much more money renting this stuff over and over again and then owning</v>

4242
02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:40.410
<v Speaker 5>it so it goes against it.</v>

4243
02:03:40.411 --> 02:03:41.360
<v Speaker 5>And then monetary sense,</v>

4244
02:03:41.370 --> 02:03:42.550
<v Speaker 5>monetarily inefficient</v>

4245
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:46.850
<v Speaker 1>car concept is a great idea for someone who wants to live in a place like New</v>

4246
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>York City where it's just prohibitively expensive to try to have a parking spot</v>

4247
02:03:50.230 --> 02:03:50.621
<v Speaker 5>anywhere.</v>

4248
02:03:50.621 --> 02:03:51.190
<v Speaker 5>If you had,</v>

4249
02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:52.600
<v Speaker 5>if you had a society designed,</v>

4250
02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:53.021
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

4251
02:03:53.021 --> 02:03:53.741
<v Speaker 5>if you're in an inner city,</v>

4252
02:03:53.741 --> 02:03:57.130
<v Speaker 5>you really want to get public transit working well because that's the best way</v>

4253
02:03:57.131 --> 02:03:57.431
<v Speaker 5>to do it.</v>

4254
02:03:57.431 --> 02:03:57.701
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

4255
02:03:57.701 --> 02:03:57.900
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

4256
02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:59.200
<v Speaker 5>there's so many failures.</v>

4257
02:03:59.610 --> 02:03:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4258
02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:00.141
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4259
02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:03.820
<v Speaker 5>my great grandfather was an engineer and he had designed the system in Los</v>

4260
02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:04.540
<v Speaker 5>Angeles years ago,</v>

4261
02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:05.380
<v Speaker 5>many years ago,</v>

4262
02:04:05.381 --> 02:04:07.120
<v Speaker 5>which was a trolley system that was above,</v>

4263
02:04:07.121 --> 02:04:07.751
<v Speaker 5>above ground,</v>

4264
02:04:07.751 --> 02:04:08.050
<v Speaker 5>wasn't,</v>

4265
02:04:08.050 --> 02:04:08.830
<v Speaker 5>wasn't uh,</v>

4266
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:11.290
<v Speaker 5>susceptible to two earthquakes.</v>

4267
02:04:11.291 --> 02:04:12.011
<v Speaker 5>It was brilliant.</v>

4268
02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:12.401
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

4269
02:04:12.401 --> 02:04:13.870
<v Speaker 5>why didn't they put this in back then?</v>

4270
02:04:13.871 --> 02:04:16.300
<v Speaker 5>It was like one of the first transit ideas for Los Angeles.</v>

4271
02:04:16.570 --> 02:04:17.351
<v Speaker 5>And even to this day,</v>

4272
02:04:17.351 --> 02:04:17.600
<v Speaker 5>you have a,</v>

4273
02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.430
<v Speaker 5>you know you have the,</v>

4274
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:20.050
<v Speaker 5>you have the subway,</v>

4275
02:04:20.051 --> 02:04:20.861
<v Speaker 5>but that's nominal.</v>

4276
02:04:20.861 --> 02:04:23.890
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really go anywhere and you have these cars just coming here.</v>

4277
02:04:23.891 --> 02:04:26.710
<v Speaker 5>I was just want to blow my brains out in traffic and cars and he said,</v>

4278
02:04:26.711 --> 02:04:27.910
<v Speaker 5>you can't keep operating like this.</v>

4279
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:28.181
<v Speaker 5>Eventually.</v>

4280
02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:29.410
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna do what they do in Latin America.</v>

4281
02:04:29.411 --> 02:04:31.370
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have you driving by license plate number.</v>

4282
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.511
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4283
02:04:31.511 --> 02:04:32.770
<v Speaker 5>they do that in Latin America.</v>

4284
02:04:32.771 --> 02:04:35.380
<v Speaker 5>You can't even drive and uncertain times.</v>

4285
02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:36.551
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4286
02:04:36.551 --> 02:04:37.230
<v Speaker 5>what's going to happen,</v>

4287
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:39.930
<v Speaker 5>population can use to increase and we had these inefficient systems in place.</v>

4288
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:40.531
<v Speaker 5>We need it to.</v>

4289
02:04:40.531 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Mexico City's like that right now.</v>

4290
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:42.863
<v Speaker 5>No sure.</v>

4291
02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:43.720
<v Speaker 5>Mexico City.</v>

4292
02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.740
<v Speaker 5>It's just unbelievable.</v>

4293
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:45.541
<v Speaker 5>Always traffic.</v>

4294
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Just traffic all day.</v>

4295
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:46.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4296
02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:47.793
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

4297
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:49.030
<v Speaker 5>Even in China,</v>

4298
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:52.980
<v Speaker 5>they've been moving out the bikes or they've been trying to motivate consumerism</v>

4299
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:54.930
<v Speaker 5>in China to get people to buy cars.</v>

4300
02:04:54.931 --> 02:04:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Why is this good for GDP?</v>

4301
02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:56.461
<v Speaker 5>Oh Great.</v>

4302
02:04:56.461 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 5>So they can create more air pollution and create more congestion on their</v>

4303
02:04:58.921 --> 02:04:59.754
<v Speaker 5>streets as well.</v>

4304
02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:01.690
<v Speaker 5>Everything is antithesis.</v>

4305
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:02.431
<v Speaker 5>The opposite.</v>

4306
02:05:02.431 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 5>It's an anti economy.</v>

4307
02:05:03.511 --> 02:05:06.630
<v Speaker 5>It ass backwards from top to bottom with the way we approach our economic</v>

4308
02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:07.464
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

4309
02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 5>So how do we fix it?</v>

4310
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.100
<v Speaker 5>We have to wait for it to fall apart.</v>

4311
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:13.680
<v Speaker 5>It's wait for him our own shit and then we have to show the audit show.</v>

4312
02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:14.101
<v Speaker 5>As I mentioned,</v>

4313
02:05:14.101 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 5>the global redesign institute.</v>

4314
02:05:14.971 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 5>You have to show the world and alternative that they can understand to see how</v>

4315
02:05:18.421 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 5>these problems can be resolved.</v>

4316
02:05:19.561 --> 02:05:23.880
<v Speaker 5>And then I advocate a parallel government system as radical as that statement</v>

4317
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:24.714
<v Speaker 5>sentence.</v>

4318
02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:27.400
<v Speaker 5>I have her low government one government well appear.</v>

4319
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Well you have the existing government in whatever region or in its holistic</v>

4320
02:05:30.751 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 5>sense as far as say the United Nations,</v>

4321
02:05:32.971 --> 02:05:33.804
<v Speaker 5>if you will.</v>

4322
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 5>The parallel system would be a group of people that are not politicians and not</v>

4323
02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:40.340
<v Speaker 5>jockeying for public support and public opinion manipulating the values and</v>

4324
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:41.790
<v Speaker 5>abortion and gay rights,</v>

4325
02:05:41.791 --> 02:05:43.520
<v Speaker 5>this and gay marriage that they,</v>

4326
02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:46.950
<v Speaker 5>those to become nominally obsolete because they are completely irrelevant</v>

4327
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:48.180
<v Speaker 5>culturally compared to what the problem is.</v>

4328
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 5>We have the group of technicians and engineers and thinkers and creators that</v>

4329
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:56.280
<v Speaker 5>want to simply design the infrastructure of society correctly to meet the needs</v>

4330
02:05:56.281 --> 02:05:57.300
<v Speaker 5>of the human population.</v>

4331
02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:59.430
<v Speaker 5>And with that train of thought,</v>

4332
02:05:59.431 --> 02:06:01.320
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you people will be chomping at the bit,</v>

4333
02:06:01.410 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 5>volunteer to show what they can do to make society more efficient and as a side</v>

4334
02:06:06.361 --> 02:06:07.680
<v Speaker 5>product of that money,</v>

4335
02:06:07.681 --> 02:06:08.550
<v Speaker 5>it goes out the window.</v>

4336
02:06:08.551 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 5>Because if you really detailed the issue of money,</v>

4337
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.910
<v Speaker 5>you can't have an efficient system in the market model of economics.</v>

4338
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:15.930
<v Speaker 5>Truly efficient.</v>

4339
02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:16.853
<v Speaker 5>It's impossible.</v>

4340
02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:17.851
<v Speaker 5>One final point,</v>

4341
02:06:17.851 --> 02:06:18.511
<v Speaker 5>green economy,</v>

4342
02:06:18.511 --> 02:06:19.590
<v Speaker 5>everyone must up a green economy,</v>

4343
02:06:19.591 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4344
02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:21.870
<v Speaker 5>The green economy books written on green economy.</v>

4345
02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:27.030
<v Speaker 5>Green economy is impossible also in a monetary system because of the inherent</v>

4346
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 5>flaw of cost efficiency,</v>

4347
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:34.380
<v Speaker 5>needing to cut corners to get the right product to make it so people can buy it.</v>

4348
02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.900
<v Speaker 5>The inherent flaws of cyclical consumption,</v>

4349
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:38.490
<v Speaker 5>the need to have constant turnover.</v>

4350
02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:39.290
<v Speaker 5>Our Sis,</v>

4351
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:42.600
<v Speaker 5>our economic system is in one big paradox and the old economic theory,</v>

4352
02:06:42.601 --> 02:06:43.680
<v Speaker 5>it says there's scarcity.</v>

4353
02:06:43.681 --> 02:06:44.790
<v Speaker 5>Therefore we have to have it.</v>

4354
02:06:45.150 --> 02:06:48.180
<v Speaker 5>The assumption of Social Darwinism that some people who can have the right to</v>

4355
02:06:48.181 --> 02:06:51.600
<v Speaker 5>this through their equity and some cannot never enough to go around as the</v>

4356
02:06:51.601 --> 02:06:52.740
<v Speaker 5>assumption simultaneously.</v>

4357
02:06:52.741 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 5>It's based on infinite growth simultaneously.</v>

4358
02:06:54.721 --> 02:06:58.860
<v Speaker 5>It assumes that we have to constantly keep consuming so people can stay employed</v>

4359
02:06:58.861 --> 02:07:02.100
<v Speaker 5>and with the growing population where you have to have more and more consumption</v>

4360
02:07:02.101 --> 02:07:02.371
<v Speaker 5>to keep.</v>

4361
02:07:02.371 --> 02:07:06.930
<v Speaker 5>Everyone that's populating employed clearly hasn't been planned out.</v>

4362
02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:07.910
<v Speaker 5>There's no planning.</v>

4363
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:08.743
<v Speaker 5>It's all been,</v>

4364
02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.500
<v Speaker 5>which is understandable and our evolution,</v>

4365
02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:11.393
<v Speaker 5>this is weird,</v>

4366
02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:14.250
<v Speaker 5>we are a monkey cells trying to figure out what the fuck's going on,</v>

4367
02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:17.010
<v Speaker 5>but luckily we can begin to assess.</v>

4368
02:07:17.011 --> 02:07:21.150
<v Speaker 5>We can see the the light and now it's the big conundrum of how to get the fuck</v>

4369
02:07:21.151 --> 02:07:24.660
<v Speaker 5>out of this system and it is something that actually works without seeing too</v>

4370
02:07:24.661 --> 02:07:26.040
<v Speaker 5>much destruction without,</v>

4371
02:07:26.041 --> 02:07:27.270
<v Speaker 5>without seeing too much breakdown.</v>

4372
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:29.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to see the system fail and the infrastructure completed be</v>

4373
02:07:29.911 --> 02:07:30.361
<v Speaker 5>demolished.</v>

4374
02:07:30.361 --> 02:07:31.920
<v Speaker 5>I want to see terrorists come out of the woodwork.</v>

4375
02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:33.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to see a,</v>

4376
02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 5>we've got to get people on mushrooms stat.</v>

4377
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:37.450
<v Speaker 7>That's what's going on,</v>

4378
02:07:37.451 --> 02:07:37.660
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4379
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.090
<v Speaker 7>The only way we're going to fix these fluxs.</v>

4380
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 7>We've got to get them on mushrooms.</v>

4381
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:41.081
<v Speaker 7>No Way.</v>

4382
02:07:41.081 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 7>People are gonna make some just radical leap of change.</v>

4383
02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:44.800
<v Speaker 7>They're going to recognize,</v>

4384
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:47.650
<v Speaker 7>just like they recognize right now in other parts of the country where there's a</v>

4385
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.150
<v Speaker 7>leadership vacuum,</v>

4386
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.950
<v Speaker 7>you know whether it's in Iraq right now,</v>

4387
02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 7>there's a rack going through a fucking civil war.</v>

4388
02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:54.490
<v Speaker 7>Congratulations from America.</v>

4389
02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:56.290
<v Speaker 7>We just fucked up another spot in the world.</v>

4390
02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.900
<v Speaker 7>One of many dictators going to move into place.</v>

4391
02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:02.080
<v Speaker 7>Some new ruthless motherfucker who dominates the situation.</v>

4392
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:03.190
<v Speaker 7>Meet the new boss.</v>

4393
02:08:03.191 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 7>Same as the old boss,</v>

4394
02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:05.290
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4395
02:08:05.290 --> 02:08:07.690
<v Speaker 7>As long as they're in favor of western geopolitics,</v>

4396
02:08:07.691 --> 02:08:08.410
<v Speaker 7>there'll be safe.</v>

4397
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:08.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4398
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:09.640
<v Speaker 7>maybe.</v>

4399
02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:10.473
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

4400
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:11.830
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck do we do,</v>

4401
02:08:11.831 --> 02:08:12.101
<v Speaker 7>Peter?</v>

4402
02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:12.551
<v Speaker 7>Joseph?</v>

4403
02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:13.570
<v Speaker 7>Do we wait for the aliens?</v>

4404
02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:15.190
<v Speaker 7>Are They not real god?</v>

4405
02:08:15.191 --> 02:08:16.360
<v Speaker 7>I really wished aliens would come.</v>

4406
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 7>They would have set a great precedent,</v>

4407
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't it?</v>

4408
02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:23.170
<v Speaker 7>We'd actually be able to see another entity that that actually was beyond us</v>

4409
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 7>that could actually give us the obvious awareness that we're one species.</v>

4410
02:08:27.401 --> 02:08:28.600
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't have one family.</v>

4411
02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:30.340
<v Speaker 7>That's the Ronald Reagan's speech.</v>

4412
02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.030
<v Speaker 7>Is it?</v>

4413
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.880
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember Ronald Reagan?</v>

4414
02:08:31.881 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 7>So I don't,</v>

4415
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember that one now.</v>

4416
02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.880
<v Speaker 7>He gave a speech during the middle of the Cold War saying that a how quickly we</v>

4417
02:08:36.881 --> 02:08:38.290
<v Speaker 7>would unite as a,</v>

4418
02:08:38.291 --> 02:08:38.860
<v Speaker 7>as a,</v>

4419
02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 7>as a race once,</v>

4420
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:43.570
<v Speaker 7>if we were faced with a threat from another world and everybody got crazy.</v>

4421
02:08:43.571 --> 02:08:45.550
<v Speaker 7>Like damn the fucking aliens are coming.</v>

4422
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:47.080
<v Speaker 7>Ronald Reagan just letting us know.</v>

4423
02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:47.561
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>

4424
02:08:47.561 --> 02:08:48.180
<v Speaker 7>Nothing happened.</v>

4425
02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:49.510
<v Speaker 7>I had a great idea for a film.</v>

4426
02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.710
<v Speaker 7>It was a bunch of hackers.</v>

4427
02:08:50.711 --> 02:08:51.071
<v Speaker 7>They go,</v>

4428
02:08:51.071 --> 02:08:52.300
<v Speaker 7>and I shouldn't give this away,</v>

4429
02:08:52.301 --> 02:08:52.711
<v Speaker 7>but I doubt it.</v>

4430
02:08:52.711 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 7>I'll give it a wedding would make it,</v>

4431
02:08:54.281 --> 02:08:54.431
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4432
02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:55.600
<v Speaker 7>I'll give you the premise cause it's fine.</v>

4433
02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:57.160
<v Speaker 7>I'll do it and it'll be online.</v>

4434
02:08:57.190 --> 02:08:58.023
<v Speaker 7>They're going to steal it.</v>

4435
02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.470
<v Speaker 7>Well I hope they steal it.</v>

4436
02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.360
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

4437
02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:00.671
<v Speaker 7>there you go.</v>

4438
02:09:00.671 --> 02:09:01.660
<v Speaker 7>Put that information out.</v>

4439
02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:02.830
<v Speaker 7>We have a whole group of hackers,</v>

4440
02:09:02.831 --> 02:09:03.101
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4441
02:09:03.101 --> 02:09:05.890
<v Speaker 7>So they hack into the u s Pentagon and hack into the military systems that are</v>

4442
02:09:05.891 --> 02:09:10.120
<v Speaker 7>interconnected around the world and they find gay porn and they plant a fake,</v>

4443
02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:14.020
<v Speaker 7>a fake asteroid attack coming towards the earth.</v>

4444
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:17.890
<v Speaker 7>So all the media now thinks there's a ginormous asteroid coming towards earth</v>

4445
02:09:17.891 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 7>that will destroy all of humanity.</v>

4446
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:20.560
<v Speaker 7>What happens?</v>

4447
02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:21.880
<v Speaker 7>The motivation of all the continents,</v>

4448
02:09:21.881 --> 02:09:22.640
<v Speaker 7>they come together,</v>

4449
02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.280
<v Speaker 7>they try to combine their resources.</v>

4450
02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:26.950
<v Speaker 7>They try to create some type of anti asteroid weapon,</v>

4451
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.310
<v Speaker 7>and then suddenly someone figures out that these are just a bunch of hackers and</v>

4452
02:09:30.311 --> 02:09:34.180
<v Speaker 7>they're brought in chains and then they give this nice speech at the end of how</v>

4453
02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:36.770
<v Speaker 7>this was their attempt to unify humanity before it was too late.</v>

4454
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:38.110
<v Speaker 7>It's like a Scooby doo episodes.</v>

4455
02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:40.683
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be duped.</v>

4456
02:09:40.690 --> 02:09:42.820
<v Speaker 7>They're hackers trying to save humanity.</v>

4457
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:43.810
<v Speaker 7>It'd be a good ploy.</v>

4458
02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:44.290
<v Speaker 7>I think it would.</v>

4459
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:45.490
<v Speaker 7>I think the audience would like that,</v>

4460
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:47.950
<v Speaker 7>especially if the audience didn't know they were hackers at the beginning.</v>

4461
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:50.260
<v Speaker 7>They thought it was all real until they came forward and I could work.</v>

4462
02:09:50.261 --> 02:09:52.780
<v Speaker 7>Who Do you think was how you don't play the leading Broderick?</v>

4463
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:55.720
<v Speaker 7>Would you go with Kristin from twilight?</v>

4464
02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:56.121
<v Speaker 7>What's her name?</v>

4465
02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:56.954
<v Speaker 7>Kristen Stewart.</v>

4466
02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.180
<v Speaker 7>She would be good right here.</v>

4467
02:09:58.181 --> 02:09:59.920
<v Speaker 7>These to be one of your good stars.</v>

4468
02:09:59.930 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 7>Who's this?</v>

4469
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:02.510
<v Speaker 7>Matthew Broderick and more games.</v>

4470
02:10:04.170 --> 02:10:05.620
<v Speaker 7>Of course.</v>

4471
02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:05.831
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4472
02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:06.520
<v Speaker 7>it's amazing.</v>

4473
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:08.050
<v Speaker 7>I like watching the alien,</v>

4474
02:10:08.051 --> 02:10:09.010
<v Speaker 7>the original alien,</v>

4475
02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:13.130
<v Speaker 7>what they thought that the cockpit of a like a sophisticated computer setup</v>

4476
02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:14.003
<v Speaker 7>would look like.</v>

4477
02:10:14.230 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 7>This is so wonky.</v>

4478
02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:16.001
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4479
02:10:16.001 --> 02:10:16.420
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

4480
02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.350
<v Speaker 7>A graphic user interface at all.</v>

4481
02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:22.030
<v Speaker 7>I'll just like numbers and letters and it's interesting.</v>

4482
02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.910
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting to see what people think about the future and what it ends up</v>

4483
02:10:24.911 --> 02:10:25.590
<v Speaker 7>being.</v>

4484
02:10:25.590 --> 02:10:27.160
<v Speaker 7>We can do it predicting space,</v>

4485
02:10:27.161 --> 02:10:28.420
<v Speaker 7>travel to other planets,</v>

4486
02:10:28.450 --> 02:10:29.283
<v Speaker 7>no problem,</v>

4487
02:10:29.390 --> 02:10:31.990
<v Speaker 7>but but figuring out a graphic user interface.</v>

4488
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:34.020
<v Speaker 7>It just really never then whatever</v>

4489
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:37.490
<v Speaker 5>wrapped their head around it yet so hard to predict what the future may hold.</v>

4490
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

4491
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.800
<v Speaker 5>Do you think the technology can save us?</v>

4492
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible that there's going to be something that comes along that creates</v>

4493
02:10:44.841 --> 02:10:49.841
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a connectivity with human beings that allows us to be more</v>

4494
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:55.241
<v Speaker 5>empathetic to the idea or or more accepting to the idea that we are really truly</v>

4495
02:10:55.491 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 5>one species,</v>

4496
02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.040
<v Speaker 5>that we are a super organism?</v>

4497
02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:01.640
<v Speaker 5>Well in the words of Carl Sagan when he was approaching,</v>

4498
02:11:01.641 --> 02:11:01.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4499
02:11:01.911 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 5>the nuclear fallout possibility during the Cold War.</v>

4500
02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:05.421
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

4501
02:11:05.421 --> 02:11:07.340
<v Speaker 5>if there's anything like positive that could come out of this,</v>

4502
02:11:07.341 --> 02:11:12.290
<v Speaker 5>it will be the unification of humanity on the level of really realizing that</v>

4503
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:15.320
<v Speaker 5>they are all at risk by the actions of just two small,</v>

4504
02:11:15.321 --> 02:11:16.790
<v Speaker 5>seemingly small superpowers.</v>

4505
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:18.770
<v Speaker 5>This is a pivotal thing.</v>

4506
02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:19.461
<v Speaker 5>Someone's breakdown,</v>

4507
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 5>a society occurs once people see how interconnected things are in the</v>

4508
02:11:22.521 --> 02:11:23.780
<v Speaker 5>infrastructure of society.</v>

4509
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:26.840
<v Speaker 5>In fact that computers run everything already.</v>

4510
02:11:27.110 --> 02:11:27.351
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4511
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:31.010
<v Speaker 5>it's very obvious the symbiosis and I think come to fruition if there's any</v>

4512
02:11:31.011 --> 02:11:33.380
<v Speaker 5>pattern that's become more of a trend now.</v>

4513
02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 5>It's the oneness poetry.</v>

4514
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:36.620
<v Speaker 5>I'd look at it very literal,</v>

4515
02:11:36.621 --> 02:11:38.900
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people would like to take it into a metaphysical sense.</v>

4516
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:43.340
<v Speaker 5>The unification of the species is not just the unification of us as a family in</v>

4517
02:11:43.341 --> 02:11:44.151
<v Speaker 5>a gestural sense.</v>

4518
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Even though you can go back,</v>

4519
02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:45.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4520
02:11:45.291 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 5>to the mitochondrial eve many thousands of years ago,</v>

4521
02:11:48.171 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 5>we all have the same basic mitochondrial DNA construct.</v>

4522
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:53.210
<v Speaker 5>We all come from that basic kernel one way or another,</v>

4523
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:54.170
<v Speaker 5>the entire species.</v>

4524
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:58.490
<v Speaker 5>But the entire association of values in our minds is utterly symbiotic.</v>

4525
02:11:58.491 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 5>It's the group mind.</v>

4526
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:00.770
<v Speaker 5>It's a collective consciousness.</v>

4527
02:12:00.771 --> 02:12:01.760
<v Speaker 5>If you want to use that old term,</v>

4528
02:12:01.761 --> 02:12:02.531
<v Speaker 5>I use the group mind.</v>

4529
02:12:02.531 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 5>It's no more practical everything you think.</v>

4530
02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Everything I think has been communicated to us one way or another.</v>

4531
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Filtered through a basic genetic preprogram combined with all sorts of other</v>

4532
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:13.460
<v Speaker 5>data coming from other people,</v>

4533
02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:15.680
<v Speaker 5>so no one originates any may anything.</v>

4534
02:12:15.681 --> 02:12:18.020
<v Speaker 5>No one thinks in any kind of novel sense.</v>

4535
02:12:18.021 --> 02:12:21.740
<v Speaker 5>It's all an illusion and is anything that could show the unification of the</v>

4536
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 5>species on that level.</v>

4537
02:12:22.731 --> 02:12:24.530
<v Speaker 5>As far as what we think we are,</v>

4538
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 5>we can only be everything because there are very constructive thought is</v>

4539
02:12:28.251 --> 02:12:30.200
<v Speaker 5>determined by what everyone else is thinking,</v>

4540
02:12:30.650 --> 02:12:32.150
<v Speaker 5>feeding into us through information,</v>

4541
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 5>whether it's your parents,</v>

4542
02:12:33.441 --> 02:12:36.020
<v Speaker 5>whether it's your educational system so there's no,</v>

4543
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 5>there's no way to rationalize separation,</v>

4544
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:39.284
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

4545
02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.850
<v Speaker 5>And other molecular quantum field level,</v>

4546
02:12:40.851 --> 02:12:41.960
<v Speaker 5>if you want to jump to that route,</v>

4547
02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:44.350
<v Speaker 5>it's all a big sea of molecules moving around just this.</v>

4548
02:12:44.351 --> 02:12:45.410
<v Speaker 5>This is all a big illusion.</v>

4549
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 5>I think we all know that by now,</v>

4550
02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:46.830
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4551
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:47.011
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4552
02:12:47.011 --> 02:12:47.841
<v Speaker 5>if you get to that,</v>

4553
02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:50.540
<v Speaker 5>how much do you think that you can manipulate your environment and with</v>

4554
02:12:50.541 --> 02:12:51.374
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

4555
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:52.101
<v Speaker 5>how much do you think?</v>

4556
02:12:52.101 --> 02:12:52.281
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4557
02:12:52.281 --> 02:12:55.340
<v Speaker 5>the beauty of the tech technology as an extension of ourselves,</v>

4558
02:12:55.341 --> 02:12:59.030
<v Speaker 5>is it the ultimate tool with mean thinking really is a technological idea,</v>

4559
02:12:59.090 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 5>logic and reason,</v>

4560
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:03.140
<v Speaker 5>which came to us just a couple thousand years ago with Aristotle with finally</v>

4561
02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.310
<v Speaker 5>figured out how to think.</v>

4562
02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:06.860
<v Speaker 5>Even though most of the is still doesn't do that,</v>

4563
02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:11.210
<v Speaker 5>these tools will lead to something and if the values are right,</v>

4564
02:13:11.211 --> 02:13:12.230
<v Speaker 5>if we see the rationale,</v>

4565
02:13:12.231 --> 02:13:13.041
<v Speaker 5>if we see the reason,</v>

4566
02:13:13.041 --> 02:13:16.460
<v Speaker 5>if we see what it means to relate to the environment is very,</v>

4567
02:13:16.461 --> 02:13:17.180
<v Speaker 5>very simple.</v>

4568
02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:19.460
<v Speaker 5>If we see the benefit of automation as a,</v>

4569
02:13:19.461 --> 02:13:20.810
<v Speaker 5>as an isolated example,</v>

4570
02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:23.270
<v Speaker 5>we naturally adapt and adjust.</v>

4571
02:13:23.570 --> 02:13:24.530
<v Speaker 5>And what's happened now though,</v>

4572
02:13:24.531 --> 02:13:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean frankly there isn't a crisis.</v>

4573
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 5>There's only the crisis of the way we think.</v>

4574
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason you couldn't turn all this around tomorrow if he wanted</v>

4575
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.780
<v Speaker 7>it to somebody who makes a terminator.</v>

4576
02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:35.221
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4577
02:13:35.221 --> 02:13:38.880
<v Speaker 7>the older fantasy a take over by machines.</v>

4578
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:39.031
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4579
02:13:39.031 --> 02:13:40.920
<v Speaker 7>I'm certainly amused by,</v>

4580
02:13:40.921 --> 02:13:42.960
<v Speaker 7>but amused were already taken over.</v>

4581
02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 7>We're already taking everybody I know,</v>

4582
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:44.941
<v Speaker 7>but I mean,</v>

4583
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:46.020
<v Speaker 7>what if it's like literal?</v>

4584
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:47.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4585
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:47.670
<v Speaker 7>there's no,</v>

4586
02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:48.270
<v Speaker 7>you don't think so?</v>

4587
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:52.110
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing in there that that I could see programming wise that would allow</v>

4588
02:13:52.111 --> 02:13:52.910
<v Speaker 7>for such a thing.</v>

4589
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:53.040
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

4590
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.290
<v Speaker 7>the ultimate expression of that was that hideous film I,</v>

4591
02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:56.400
<v Speaker 7>robot at the very end,</v>

4592
02:13:56.401 --> 02:13:57.210
<v Speaker 7>the computer goes,</v>

4593
02:13:57.210 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 7>we add to exterminate all of humanity because they are a threat to the planet.</v>

4594
02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:03.790
<v Speaker 7>So are logical calculation that humanity can no longer exist.</v>

4595
02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 7>That's the ultimate Scifi fantasy of artificial intelligence wasn't necessary,</v>

4596
02:14:07.951 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 7>but that's a big budget.</v>

4597
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:10.770
<v Speaker 7>Will Smith Film and they got to do what they gotta do.</v>

4598
02:14:10.771 --> 02:14:11.161
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

4599
02:14:11.161 --> 02:14:12.750
<v Speaker 7>as as an idea of,</v>

4600
02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:16.440
<v Speaker 7>but that's that catered to the long standing assumptions of artificial</v>

4601
02:14:16.441 --> 02:14:19.230
<v Speaker 7>intelligence and automation and technological singularity.</v>

4602
02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:20.363
<v Speaker 7>You sure?</v>

4603
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:21.690
<v Speaker 7>And as Curtis ballpoints though,</v>

4604
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:24.390
<v Speaker 7>we don't really know what will happen with the technological singularity,</v>

4605
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:28.230
<v Speaker 7>but technology becomes sentient and as the ability to move and manipulate</v>

4606
02:14:28.231 --> 02:14:28.680
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>

4607
02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:29.400
<v Speaker 7>who knows?</v>

4608
02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:29.581
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4609
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:30.031
<v Speaker 7>if there are,</v>

4610
02:14:30.031 --> 02:14:31.200
<v Speaker 7>if they are extensions of us,</v>

4611
02:14:31.201 --> 02:14:32.190
<v Speaker 7>they become our tools.</v>

4612
02:14:32.191 --> 02:14:35.910
<v Speaker 7>Who's to say we want to program them to kill it says who says us?</v>

4613
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:39.220
<v Speaker 7>That's what we were talking about earlier about failed symbiotic show that the,</v>

4614
02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:41.130
<v Speaker 7>the parasitic relationship between,</v>

4615
02:14:41.410 --> 02:14:42.960
<v Speaker 7>I mean the symbiotic right now,</v>

4616
02:14:43.170 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 7>relationship between human beings and computers.</v>

4617
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.660
<v Speaker 7>It's very similar to if you look at like other organisms that have a,</v>

4618
02:14:49.690 --> 02:14:49.921
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4619
02:14:49.921 --> 02:14:51.420
<v Speaker 7>lampreys on sharks or whatever.</v>

4620
02:14:51.421 --> 02:14:53.070
<v Speaker 7>I mean we're almost separable.</v>

4621
02:14:53.071 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 7>We're a part of the same sort of ecosystem now.</v>

4622
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:56.190
<v Speaker 7>We need the lights to stay on,</v>

4623
02:14:56.191 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 7>we need their refrigerator to stay cold so that we can preserve the meat better.</v>

4624
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:00.611
<v Speaker 7>I mean we,</v>

4625
02:15:00.611 --> 02:15:05.160
<v Speaker 7>we have it sort of set out so we're almost completely intertwined with</v>

4626
02:15:05.161 --> 02:15:07.680
<v Speaker 7>technology and habitable and then we give birth,</v>

4627
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:08.520
<v Speaker 7>the live one,</v>

4628
02:15:08.521 --> 02:15:11.910
<v Speaker 7>we give birth to technology where it's sent in and we're could figure shit out</v>

4629
02:15:11.911 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 7>on own and it becomes another life form.</v>

4630
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 7>It becomes a life form.</v>

4631
02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:17.740
<v Speaker 7>Much like a biological carbon based life form.</v>

4632
02:15:17.770 --> 02:15:20.910
<v Speaker 7>Just completely different and unexpected and something we didn't see coming.</v>

4633
02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:22.020
<v Speaker 7>Just like,</v>

4634
02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:22.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4635
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:23.280
<v Speaker 7>it's all very possible.</v>

4636
02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:24.211
<v Speaker 7>You mean,</v>

4637
02:15:24.211 --> 02:15:26.400
<v Speaker 7>do you ever like look at look broken computers and shit?</v>

4638
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:27.061
<v Speaker 7>Those are bodies.</v>

4639
02:15:27.061 --> 02:15:27.811
<v Speaker 7>It was a dead body.</v>

4640
02:15:27.811 --> 02:15:28.041
<v Speaker 7>Sure,</v>

4641
02:15:28.041 --> 02:15:28.540
<v Speaker 7>sure.</v>

4642
02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:29.550
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking dinosaurs.</v>

4643
02:15:29.551 --> 02:15:32.250
<v Speaker 7>But they're happening really quickly at this stage of our evolution.</v>

4644
02:15:32.251 --> 02:15:32.701
<v Speaker 7>Either we,</v>

4645
02:15:32.701 --> 02:15:33.210
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4646
02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:36.960
<v Speaker 7>utilize technology to help us and hope for the best or we're going to perish</v>

4647
02:15:36.961 --> 02:15:37.351
<v Speaker 7>anyway.</v>

4648
02:15:37.351 --> 02:15:38.790
<v Speaker 7>So if it happens to be,</v>

4649
02:15:38.791 --> 02:15:40.810
<v Speaker 7>we become enslaved by a bunch of machines in the NFL,</v>

4650
02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:41.361
<v Speaker 7>so be it.</v>

4651
02:15:41.361 --> 02:15:42.690
<v Speaker 7>That must be a natural evolution.</v>

4652
02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:46.470
<v Speaker 7>So you're cool with that given what's at stake today.</v>

4653
02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:47.304
<v Speaker 7>I'm cool with that.</v>

4654
02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 7>Given what we have to deal with.</v>

4655
02:15:49.290 --> 02:15:52.200
<v Speaker 7>I'm perfectly happy to be robots like that is now I'm going to be on the</v>

4656
02:15:52.201 --> 02:15:52.650
<v Speaker 7>Internet.</v>

4657
02:15:52.650 --> 02:15:53.431
<v Speaker 7>Peter Joseph.</v>

4658
02:15:53.431 --> 02:15:55.560
<v Speaker 7>Cool with robots taking over.</v>

4659
02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.310
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

4660
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:57.143
<v Speaker 7>I'm cool with that.</v>

4661
02:15:57.610 --> 02:15:57.820
<v Speaker 7>Cool.</v>

4662
02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:58.290
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

4663
02:15:58.290 --> 02:15:59.880
<v Speaker 7>this is like ice movements,</v>

4664
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 7>primary premise.</v>

4665
02:16:01.110 --> 02:16:02.320
<v Speaker 7>We're cool with robots taken.</v>

4666
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:04.050
<v Speaker 7>I will say this if the Fallis,</v>

4667
02:16:04.100 --> 02:16:09.100
<v Speaker 7>the f the problem of human psychology is so vast now that I can only dream of</v>

4668
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:16.430
<v Speaker 7>the cold quality of calculation coming forward to save us because we've fucked</v>

4669
02:16:17.401 --> 02:16:18.720
<v Speaker 7>up just about everything so far.</v>

4670
02:16:18.721 --> 02:16:21.480
<v Speaker 7>We are way beyond our sense of self control.</v>

4671
02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.970
<v Speaker 7>That's what calculated society is.</v>

4672
02:16:23.971 --> 02:16:24.930
<v Speaker 7>That's what our brain does.</v>

4673
02:16:24.931 --> 02:16:28.020
<v Speaker 7>It's a calculation process and it's too bad.</v>

4674
02:16:28.021 --> 02:16:30.090
<v Speaker 7>We're so clouded these us and</v>

4675
02:16:30.090 --> 02:16:30.911
<v Speaker 2>them issues.</v>

4676
02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:34.120
<v Speaker 2>And all these things that are evolutionary baggage.</v>

4677
02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:35.013
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4678
02:16:35.590 --> 02:16:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

4679
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:38.020
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to see an amazing,</v>

4680
02:16:38.021 --> 02:16:41.470
<v Speaker 2>beautiful society and marriage if we simply wanted to construct one correctly</v>

4681
02:16:41.471 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 2>cause we have that power now and we have mushrooms.</v>

4682
02:16:46.630 --> 02:16:47.500
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>

4683
02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:48.970
<v Speaker 2>That's an important part of the equation.</v>

4684
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to fix people without some sort of a large scale</v>

4685
02:16:52.181 --> 02:16:53.530
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiment.</v>

4686
02:16:53.650 --> 02:16:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I did see an evolution special that alluded to that old Bill Hicks joke,</v>

4687
02:16:57.131 --> 02:17:01.390
<v Speaker 2>which may be came true that mushrooms could have been that link that pushed</v>

4688
02:17:01.391 --> 02:17:01.931
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

4689
02:17:01.931 --> 02:17:02.770
<v Speaker 2>The human brain.</v>

4690
02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:04.031
<v Speaker 2>Just theory,</v>

4691
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 2>the stoned ape theory.</v>

4692
02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what you probably saw.</v>

4693
02:17:06.490 --> 02:17:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4694
02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:09.720
<v Speaker 2>He said that it was in a more academic circle too though,</v>

4695
02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:11.560
<v Speaker 2>is actually more than just Mckenna.</v>

4696
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:11.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4697
02:17:11.981 --> 02:17:14.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of scientists that have speculated it because you know,</v>

4698
02:17:14.741 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4699
02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:17.980
<v Speaker 2>the incredible powers of psychedelic plants.</v>

4700
02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean as far as like,</v>

4701
02:17:19.301 --> 02:17:20.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4702
02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:21.160
<v Speaker 2>powers of experience.</v>

4703
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you don't know,</v>

4704
02:17:22.841 --> 02:17:23.680
<v Speaker 2>if you never had it,</v>

4705
02:17:23.681 --> 02:17:25.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people ignorant to the experience.</v>

4706
02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:26.290
<v Speaker 2>You've done mushrooms before.</v>

4707
02:17:26.650 --> 02:17:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I have you just wink if you're worried about the PR you everything in high</v>

4708
02:17:31.751 --> 02:17:32.471
<v Speaker 2>school and college.</v>

4709
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:36.220
<v Speaker 2>So if you've had a real big experience,</v>

4710
02:17:36.221 --> 02:17:37.054
<v Speaker 2>a big trip,</v>

4711
02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you realize how humbling it is first of all,</v>

4712
02:17:40.361 --> 02:17:42.280
<v Speaker 2>just to know that that's possible.</v>

4713
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:46.060
<v Speaker 2>That that's even an experience that a person can have and that they're not dying</v>

4714
02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:46.571
<v Speaker 2>from it either.</v>

4715
02:17:46.571 --> 02:17:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And then I know,</v>

4716
02:17:47.521 --> 02:17:47.641
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4717
02:17:47.641 --> 02:17:50.770
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of friends that have had gone through crazy psychedelic trips and</v>

4718
02:17:50.771 --> 02:17:51.604
<v Speaker 2>everyone's okay.</v>

4719
02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:52.480
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

4720
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:52.871
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4721
02:17:52.871 --> 02:17:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4722
02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:55.390
<v Speaker 2>the experience itself,</v>

4723
02:17:55.450 --> 02:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>to someone who's uninitiated,</v>

4724
02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.570
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to imagine like you,</v>

4725
02:18:01.571 --> 02:18:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine that it's really possible that this could exist.</v>

4726
02:18:05.250 --> 02:18:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And then this is not discussed every day on CBS evening news that someone's not</v>

4727
02:18:09.041 --> 02:18:09.281
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

4728
02:18:09.281 --> 02:18:09.701
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

4729
02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you need to get on mushrooms.</v>

4730
02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:11.651
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4731
02:18:11.651 --> 02:18:14.500
<v Speaker 2>you need to find a fucking place where you're comfortable and you need someone</v>

4732
02:18:14.501 --> 02:18:15.520
<v Speaker 2>who gets you the good shit.</v>

4733
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:17.290
<v Speaker 2>And he need to go there with clear tent.</v>

4734
02:18:17.291 --> 02:18:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And you need to do yoga and need to find yourself because life can be way</v>

4735
02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:21.250
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

4736
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And this recent John Hopkins study with a dark talked about one dose.</v>

4737
02:18:25.361 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>They had one large dose of Psilocybin and they had measurable increases in their</v>

4738
02:18:29.261 --> 02:18:29.741
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>

4739
02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:32.590
<v Speaker 2>their personality over a period of like 20 years</v>

4740
02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:36.100
<v Speaker 2>reset their whole life.</v>

4741
02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4742
02:18:36.970 --> 02:18:40.560
<v Speaker 2>So could we need [inaudible] add mushrooms to the psyche</v>

4743
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.260
<v Speaker 2>in harmony and Fox match?</v>

4744
02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:46.953
<v Speaker 2>We Need Fox.</v>

4745
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird,</v>

4746
02:18:47.981 --> 02:18:48.431
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

4747
02:18:48.431 --> 02:18:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4748
02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm still trying to figure it out.</v>

4749
02:18:49.991 --> 02:18:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Rupert Micro Rupert as our whole Fox magic thing where he believes in Fox and</v>

4750
02:18:53.921 --> 02:18:54.221
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4751
02:18:54.221 --> 02:18:54.560
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

4752
02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:55.630
<v Speaker 2>let's be real honest.</v>

4753
02:18:55.631 --> 02:18:56.650
<v Speaker 2>He was high as fuck.</v>

4754
02:18:56.651 --> 02:18:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar with time.</v>

4755
02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:59.620
<v Speaker 2>And if you get that guy sober,</v>

4756
02:18:59.621 --> 02:19:01.060
<v Speaker 2>we probably would've never said that.</v>

4757
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:02.200
<v Speaker 2>He knows Fox magic.</v>

4758
02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:03.880
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting cat,</v>

4759
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:04.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4760
02:19:04.361 --> 02:19:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be that guy.</v>

4761
02:19:05.981 --> 02:19:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4762
02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.193
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

4763
02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:07.800
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4764
02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:08.081
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

4765
02:19:08.081 --> 02:19:08.711
<v Speaker 2>he's out there,</v>

4766
02:19:08.711 --> 02:19:09.040
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4767
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:09.311
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4768
02:19:09.311 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 2>he's not following any of the status quo.</v>

4769
02:19:11.171 --> 02:19:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That guys out there trying to expose corruption in the government at every,</v>

4770
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.810
<v Speaker 2>every step of the way.</v>

4771
02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.130
<v Speaker 2>You have to be a little,</v>

4772
02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:18.881
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>

4773
02:19:18.881 --> 02:19:19.714
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4774
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

4775
02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Loony.</v>

4776
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:21.491
<v Speaker 2>He's got a,</v>

4777
02:19:21.491 --> 02:19:22.151
<v Speaker 2>here's a hero.</v>

4778
02:19:22.151 --> 02:19:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Quality to him is,</v>

4779
02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:23.651
<v Speaker 2>he's out there.</v>

4780
02:19:23.651 --> 02:19:24.281
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it.</v>

4781
02:19:24.281 --> 02:19:25.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't really fuck with amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You could tell he's a good guy.</v>

4784
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:28.791
<v Speaker 7>He's a good guy.</v>

4785
02:19:28.791 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 7>When you talk to him and he's not an asshole south,</v>

4786
02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 7>they're doing the right thing.</v>

<v Speaker 7>this is very cool conversation.</v>

4800
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:53.930
<v Speaker 7>Is there anything else you want to say?</v>

4801
02:19:53.931 --> 02:19:55.700
<v Speaker 7>Is there anything that people need to know about?</v>

4802
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.960
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4803
02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:57.793
<v Speaker 7>shit,</v>

4804
02:19:58.170 --> 02:20:00.200
<v Speaker 7>there's tons of things I could say and tons of things.</v>

4805
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:00.351
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4806
02:20:00.351 --> 02:20:01.520
<v Speaker 7>we got events coming up.</v>

4807
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to be in New York.</v>

4808
02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:06.400
<v Speaker 7>If anyone's in New York at the end of this month in Colombia to hook up,</v>

4809
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:07.340
<v Speaker 7>go for some drinks.</v>

4810
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 7>What is the best way to find out information?</v>

4811
02:20:13.641 --> 02:20:14.900
<v Speaker 7>What is your number one website?</v>

4812
02:20:14.901 --> 02:20:15.620
<v Speaker 7>I know it's,</v>

4813
02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:19.670
<v Speaker 7>it's Tz movement on those like guys movement,</v>

4814
02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.320
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] movement on Twitter.</v>

4815
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:22.460
<v Speaker 7>That's for the movement.</v>

4816
02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 7>What is the best way to be informed?</v>

4817
02:20:24.141 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 7>What website can people go to?</v>

4818
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 7>May Movement side is just simply the zeitgeists movement.com and then the movie</v>

4819
02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 7>side does zeitgeisty movie.com and then you can link to all the other sub sites</v>

4820
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:37.770
<v Speaker 7>for the films and there's a bunch of scam sites that like they said like I guess</v>

4821
02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:42.140
<v Speaker 7>film series has been subject to more manipulation and scam and resellers.</v>

4822
02:20:42.141 --> 02:20:47.141
<v Speaker 7>I've been screwed over so extensive by attempting to be altruistic with the</v>

4823
02:20:47.181 --> 02:20:48.320
<v Speaker 7>distribution of that film.</v>

4824
02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:50.260
<v Speaker 7>People buy things from me,</v>

4825
02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:50.841
<v Speaker 7>resell it,</v>

4826
02:20:50.841 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 7>profit all over the place.</v>

4827
02:20:51.891 --> 02:20:55.760
<v Speaker 7>I just now stopped doing a lot of things I used to do after four years cause I,</v>

4828
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:56.600
<v Speaker 7>I'm running out of money.</v>

4829
02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.700
<v Speaker 7>I can barely see myself making this new film.</v>

4830
02:20:58.701 --> 02:21:01.190
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be quite the quite the difficult venture,</v>

4831
02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:04.940
<v Speaker 7>but it's like just has attracted just about everything,</v>

4832
02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.850
<v Speaker 7>whether it's people that want to abuse it,</v>

4833
02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:08.870
<v Speaker 7>people that hate me,</v>

4834
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:11.060
<v Speaker 7>people that like it does.</v>

4835
02:21:11.061 --> 02:21:11.331
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4836
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:15.020
<v Speaker 7>no more strange phenomenon I've come across recently and in the Zike guys</v>

4837
02:21:15.021 --> 02:21:15.381
<v Speaker 7>phenomena.</v>

4838
02:21:15.381 --> 02:21:16.490
<v Speaker 7>As far as a cultural issue.</v>

4839
02:21:16.491 --> 02:21:19.880
<v Speaker 7>It's really strange and I'm just imagining it must be a pretty big life change</v>

4840
02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:22.760
<v Speaker 7>to go from just being a classical musician,</v>

4841
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:23.480
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4842
02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:26.750
<v Speaker 7>To all of a sudden at the head of some crazy movement where you're being</v>

4843
02:21:26.751 --> 02:21:30.290
<v Speaker 7>critiqued and criticized for every single word that comes anyway,</v>

4844
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:31.340
<v Speaker 7>probably were critiqued.</v>

4845
02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:34.520
<v Speaker 7>People gonna be mad at you for even doing this stupid show,</v>

4846
02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.760
<v Speaker 7>this ridiculous show.</v>

4847
02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 7>We make fun of everything.</v>

4848
02:21:36.891 --> 02:21:37.350
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

4849
02:21:37.350 --> 02:21:41.150
<v Speaker 7>I think it's important to realize that we're all just people and no one should</v>

4850
02:21:41.151 --> 02:21:43.430
<v Speaker 7>take any of them said anyone that seriously.</v>

4851
02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:44.290
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4852
02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 7>I have a great deal of humor with all of this.</v>

4853
02:21:46.461 --> 02:21:46.621
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4854
02:21:46.621 --> 02:21:48.020
<v Speaker 7>I have the Carlin level,</v>

4855
02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:51.800
<v Speaker 7>I call it sitting on the sideline and that's something I don't readily admit,</v>

4856
02:21:51.801 --> 02:21:52.700
<v Speaker 7>but the Carlin level,</v>

4857
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:55.970
<v Speaker 7>George Carlin is where you just don't give a shit anymore.</v>

4858
02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.430
<v Speaker 7>And as much as I push forward with all of this,</v>

4859
02:21:58.431 --> 02:21:59.450
<v Speaker 7>there's a side of me that says,</v>

4860
02:21:59.451 --> 02:22:00.050
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>

4861
02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:01.160
<v Speaker 7>It is what it is.</v>

4862
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.410
<v Speaker 7>If myself,</v>

4863
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:04.020
<v Speaker 7>if my partial,</v>

4864
02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:04.431
<v Speaker 7>excuse me,</v>

4865
02:22:04.431 --> 02:22:08.060
<v Speaker 7>if I become just deeply unhappy and he get tired of what I'm doing,</v>

4866
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:09.403
<v Speaker 7>then I'm gone.</v>

4867
02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:10.401
<v Speaker 7>And it is what it is.</v>

4868
02:22:10.401 --> 02:22:10.641
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

4869
02:22:10.641 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 7>I don't owe anybody anything.</v>

4870
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.390
<v Speaker 7>If people out there support such ideas,</v>

4871
02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.420
<v Speaker 7>they need to become their own leaders and really push this forward,</v>

4872
02:22:17.421 --> 02:22:17.811
<v Speaker 7>learn,</v>

4873
02:22:17.811 --> 02:22:18.644
<v Speaker 7>educate,</v>

4874
02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:20.930
<v Speaker 7>and do the same process that I had been doing.</v>

4875
02:22:20.931 --> 02:22:22.220
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing special here.</v>

4876
02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:24.710
<v Speaker 7>So there's anything I would leave to the audience that actually has an activist</v>

4877
02:22:24.711 --> 02:22:25.500
<v Speaker 7>bone.</v>

4878
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 7>It's that don't,</v>

4879
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 6>don't follow anybody.</v>

4880
02:22:27.271 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 6>You got to get out there and do it.</v>

4881
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 6>Cause a lot of these people that are at trying to lead,</v>

4882
02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:31.260
<v Speaker 6>if you will,</v>

4883
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.460
<v Speaker 6>are not going to be around forever.</v>

4884
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:33.900
<v Speaker 6>I could hit the car loan level and say,</v>

4885
02:22:33.901 --> 02:22:34.710
<v Speaker 6>fuck it.</v>

4886
