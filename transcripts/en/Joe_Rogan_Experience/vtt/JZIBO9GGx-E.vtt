126
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>the idea that other people's experiences in life might be true even if it's not</v>

127
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:11.824
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

128
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

129
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

130
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.221
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>

131
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 2>And also like,</v>

132

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 2>other things are out there.</v>

134
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I started seeing it.</v>

135
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there's just like,</v>

136
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.291
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

137
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:20.660
<v Speaker 2>You can be,</v>

138
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

139
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>you can cut somebody off in traffic and not let him in.</v>

140
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.771
<v Speaker 2>That's my thing.</v>

141
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I fucked that guy over.</v>

144
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Or it's almost harder to fucking fit somebody in sometimes.</v>

145
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

146
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

147
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.371
<v Speaker 2>I could do,</v>

148
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.181

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 2>in that sense that you,</v>

216
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

218
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you kind of are on your own.</v>

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

220
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of making your own destiny and you kind of,</v>

221
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to think and behave the way everybody in the office does cause</v>

223
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>there is no fucking office.</v>

224
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of out there trying to sort out what is,</v>

225
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 2>what is acceptable because so many of what,</v>

226
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 2>so much of what we think of as acceptable,</v>

227
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just patterns.</v>

228
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just follows the pattern.</v>

229
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what's supposed to make you happy.</v>

230
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 2>You have a beer at the ballgame that doesn't make you happy while you're fuck</v>

231
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

232
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.290
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

233
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>we'll do something else that makes you happy.</v>

234
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

235
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

236
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea what the rest made you just really focus on what the fuck it</v>

237
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:38.951
<v Speaker 2>is that I like,</v>

238
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>not what everybody wants me to like,</v>

239
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.193
<v Speaker 2>but what do I like?</v>

240
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's like if someone's going to think I'm an asshole for doing this,</v>

241
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 2>somebody's going to think I'm weak for doing whatever it is.</v>

242
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Like that's cool.</v>

243
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

244
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I just care about making me happy.</v>

245
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 2>They used to even joke around about on stage about being a terrible person and I</v>

246
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

247
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that job because you're not a terrible person.</v>

248
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I used to say like you're just kind of playing it up to make it seem,</v>

249
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.090
<v Speaker 1>make more sense to stay a joke.</v>

250
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible person.</v>

251
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of it too was like,</v>

252
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a terrible person when I do these few things because I'm a good</v>

253
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>person so I feel horrible about a few things you might do.</v>

254
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

255
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>But even then terrible things.</v>

256
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>They were never terrible things.</v>

257
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.381
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

258
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it was just a sort of a method to get to the list to call yourself a terrible</v>

259
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

260
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta always be careful about that audience.</v>

261
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>People go to have a good time.</v>

262
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to think they're having a good time with this terrible</v>

263
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.684
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

264
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>just dealing as fucking evil venom.</v>

265

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305

<v Speaker 1>because I mean we've been friends for a long time and like,</v>

306
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307

<v Speaker 1>everybody has relationship issues,</v>

308
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>but you were overage critically disturbed by them.</v>

309
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Like you would have them and you could sell it.</v>

310
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>You could tell it was just like crushing.</v>

311
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:56.534
<v Speaker 1>You just couldn't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

314
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to get over and then see the big picture.</v>

315
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

316
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>especially when you know someone breaks up with you or you know you thought it</v>

317
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:07.431
<v Speaker 1>was going to work out in,</v>

318
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that falls apart.</v>

319
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>You blame yourself.</v>

320
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck so hard to like come into your own.</v>

321
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're alone,</v>

322
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know that's true,</v>

323
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 1>but you aren't from that staff man.</v>

324
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>It's good to get completely disintegrated from time to time.</v>

325
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.591
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

326
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time you actually find someone that you really truly are</v>

327
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.334
<v Speaker 1>compatible with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you've gone through a bunch of different things and you understand the cause and</v>

330
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

331

<v Speaker 1>You understand the early warning signs.</v>

332
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.823
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>

333
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.361

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

401
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:24.281

402
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 4>could be something and you didn't become that.</v>

405
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.010
<v Speaker 4>I think he could be like a thing.</v>

406
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.510

412
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.593
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest one.</v>

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.340
<v Speaker 1>so tell me how should we do a move with you?</v>

437
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Why should we do a movie with you?</v>

438
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Tell me and it kicks back.</v>

439
00:11:25.481 --> 00:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Crosses his legs.</v>

440
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.133
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

441
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 4>cause they think it's going to be,</v>

442
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 4>they think it's going to be like a story.</v>

443
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 4>He came in and I said</v>

444
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Trump is fucking things.</v>

445
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:37.990
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

446
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.230
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

447
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 4>and we knew he was their guy.</v>

448
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.050
<v Speaker 4>He was a Douche bag.</v>

449
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.230
<v Speaker 4>I kept saying that it what I don't like about movies when someone does something</v>

450
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:45.400
<v Speaker 4>absolutely ridiculous.</v>

451
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 4>When a guy like runs a jumps and kicks two guys at the same time we had,</v>

452
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Speaker 4>we talked about this last time we were here.</v>

453
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 4>That's why you a very short action movies.</v>

454
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

455
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 4>You make very short,</v>

456
00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 4>realistic action movies.</v>

457
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 4>That would be my actual movie.</v>

458
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Headbutt slammed to the balls from the ground.</v>

459
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 4>STOMP has had</v>

460
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.831
<v Speaker 4>very little time.</v>

461
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.210
<v Speaker 4>There's no exchanging blows quick.</v>

462
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Nobody waits like Batman for that for one fight to end.</v>

463
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.060
<v Speaker 4>They jump on you and kill you and then there's no one.</v>

464
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.120
<v Speaker 4>My podcast,</v>

465
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:16.954
<v Speaker 4>the champs,</v>

466
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 4>we talked about how we would,</v>

467
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 4>how we have three,</v>

468
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 4>my three guys that I dealt with,</v>

469
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 4>the two guys had to do with how we would take Blake Griffin,</v>

470
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 4>the three of you together and my move was going to be,</v>

471
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 4>I'd fight his love handle,</v>

472
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 4>which is really painful and it was my brother one time.</v>

473
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 4>You think that stopped them?</v>

474
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

475
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 4>now he said he would just punch me.</v>

476
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

477
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 4>Even that wouldn't stop.</v>

478
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 4>You cannot hurt someone so much for the bite to love handle.</v>

479
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.133
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kill them.</v>

480
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm in real trouble.</v>

481
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

482
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I would say don't do that.</v>

483
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 4>If you bit me,</v>

484
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

485
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 4>I would kill you for sure because I know you'd be capable of doing something</v>

486
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 4>really naughty like biting me.</v>

487
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to kill you.</v>

488
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't you just bite ball balls to,</v>

489
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:55.520
<v Speaker 4>why would you go as,</v>

490
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I ain't no bitch man.</v>

491
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.311
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

492
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 4>you can really fuck someone's balls up through the pants.</v>

493
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.004
<v Speaker 4>When I think of my,</v>

494
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

495
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 4>but by the time you get down there,</v>

496
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

497
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna just let you buy my,</v>

498
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 4>Paul's going to move out of the way.</v>

499
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take you a while to secure a ball biding position.</v>

500
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.821
<v Speaker 4>You've got to find it.</v>

501
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Hey is that shaft and I would have that chat and you bite of shaft.</v>

502
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 4>I've learned a thing or two along the way and I'm going to implement them and on</v>

503
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 4>you while you're trying to find my cock and balls of my cock and balls.</v>

504
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I would say no.</v>

505
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 4>So that is a thing that people do though.</v>

506
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:23.670
<v Speaker 4>Sit around thinking like,</v>

507
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

508
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 4>how would I do it?</v>

509
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 4>This guy was going to come after me.</v>

510
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Brian has a very unique move to avoid rape in prison where he pretends these</v>

511
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 4>kind of blow the guy and then he just pulls his dick off.</v>

512
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Just take that ball and stick your finger nails in and run.</v>

513
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.341
<v Speaker 4>That's going to work.</v>

514
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

515
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 4>It will work once.</v>

516
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't even need to work on.</v>

517
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 4>If you've got a guy with a big meaty cock,</v>

518
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.541
<v Speaker 4>you really thinking,</v>

519
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:44.700
<v Speaker 4>you pull that cap off with one yank calendar.</v>

520
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 4>One of those guys who I actually believe if he believes something enough he</v>

521
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 4>could make it so you know what I mean?</v>

522
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Like he could believe he's like,</v>

523
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:53.630
<v Speaker 4>uh yeah.</v>

524
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 4>You could pull a car like he,</v>

525
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 4>if any.</v>

526
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 4>If I had to bet that any one person could pull a cock off of a dude,</v>

527
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 4>a hard an erect cock at that,</v>

528
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.903
<v Speaker 4>it would be calories.</v>

529
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 4>You could do it.</v>

530
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I just believe because we don't believe it,</v>

531
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 4>if he got a bully,</v>

532
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 4>you don't live in Collin Wood is so delusional.</v>

533
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Just as a person that I agree with balloon.</v>

534
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 4>I know Brian Count enough to know that even if he believed that he could pull</v>

535
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:19.391
<v Speaker 4>the cock off,</v>

536
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.670
<v Speaker 4>he could not pull the cock on it.</v>

537
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 4>So I know that you would believe that he could do it.</v>

538
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.304
<v Speaker 4>And I would sit there and go,</v>

539
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I hear Ya.</v>

540
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 4>And I would stand there and go,</v>

541
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 4>he's not gonna be able to pull the car off and he won't be able to pull the car</v>

542
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:29.501
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

543
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.091
<v Speaker 4>He'll grab it,</v>

544
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 4>he'll believe to yank on it.</v>

545
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 4>It's hard as fuck man.</v>

546
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to pull it deck off.</v>

547
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.541
<v Speaker 4>Blake Griffin,</v>

548
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.374
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

549
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 4>How big is Blake Griffin?</v>

550
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 4>He's huge and his hands are like 20 to 40 to 50 something like that.</v>

551
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.771
<v Speaker 4>He might be able to,</v>

552
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.771
<v Speaker 4>it's a little Chinese deck but it looks like set a big the cockiest size,</v>

553
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

554
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.431
<v Speaker 4>cause it's like,</v>

555
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the bigger it would be easier could you get torque?</v>

556
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Irrelevant.</v>

557
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So much tendons and ligaments and stick around.</v>

558
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It's connected in more parts,</v>

559
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>more cells are connected.</v>

560
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

561
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a soft Dick is probably easier to rip off in a heart deck.</v>

562
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

563
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could rip it more.</v>

564
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>There's more ripping motion where you could dig your nails and just rip the</v>

565
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>whole around your fingers.</v>

566
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not elbow skin,</v>

567
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:10.000
<v Speaker 1>it's soft skin.</v>

568
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.690
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder a time talking on the podcast and then</v>

569
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you probably can do it.</v>

570
00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm a real strong guy.</v>

571
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Mario has put you announced that you could probably put your cock off.</v>

572
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

573
00:15:22.141 --> 00:15:23.340
<v Speaker 1>we as the strong man guy,</v>

574
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

575
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

576
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.160
<v Speaker 1>it tastes like fun goals.</v>

577
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.970

596
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.180

<v Speaker 5>at the same time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One night.</v>

636
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And what does the name of this movie that you're working on right now?</v>

637
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:24.611
<v Speaker 1>They made a movie.</v>

638
00:17:24.611 --> 00:17:25.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on right now.</v>

639
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's called pimps again,</v>

640
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.200
<v Speaker 1>it's about pimps being slaves.</v>

641
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a slasher movie,</v>

642
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a commonly,</v>

643
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.441
<v Speaker 1>and when you see,</v>

644
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you remember who wrote it?</v>

645
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.703
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny mood.</v>

646
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.090
<v Speaker 1>The citizen Kane of pimp.</v>

647

<v Speaker 1>Slash.</v>

649
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.923
<v Speaker 1>Movie.</v>

650
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 1>When we tested it,</v>

651
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>some positive for PCP and I was like,</v>

652
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.033
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

653
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 6>that's not my straw,</v>

654
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 6>but I can almost guarantee you that there's nothing like that on it is going to</v>

655
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:55.801
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

656
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:56.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

657
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 6>it's like if I had to guess what that Charles Port,</v>

658
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.350
<v Speaker 6>it's true packet,</v>

659
00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 6>we'd into a joint.</v>

660
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.493
<v Speaker 6>And the dude was like,</v>

661
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

662
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.441
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

663
00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 6>And he was pieces together.</v>

664
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 6>He was fishing me out in front of a piece of meat on that Straw,</v>

665
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.420
<v Speaker 6>but he could not fucking figure out for the life of him what a straw was doing</v>

666
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 6>it a container or ground up weed.</v>

667
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:13.610
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

668
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 6>is this fat Moron snorting weed?</v>

669
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.631
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

670
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.640
<v Speaker 6>is he starting week?</v>

671
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 6>So he put me to the test going like,</v>

672
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:21.870
<v Speaker 6>we found a piece of crap.</v>

673
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

674
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.390
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

675
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.511
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

676
00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

677
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 6>It's for this instead.</v>

678
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:24.931
<v Speaker 6>Although that's,</v>

679
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.764
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure,</v>

680
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 6>but I think that's what it's for.</v>

681
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 6>I was in that pen,</v>

682
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 6>I was in the holding cell for maybe like an hour and a half.</v>

683
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.741
<v Speaker 6>They were really nice.</v>

684
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:35.551
<v Speaker 6>It was Canada.</v>

685
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 6>I was like right in here in Montreal.</v>

686
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.750
<v Speaker 6>I was on my way to go to just for last last.</v>

687
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.160
<v Speaker 6>So they'd probably get just as scary.</v>

688
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

689
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.311
<v Speaker 6>they did.</v>

690
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 6>The dude who came,</v>

691
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 6>like they pulled the bus,</v>

692
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:43.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

693
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.420
<v Speaker 6>are going through customs and they come to the door and it was man,</v>

694
00:18:47.421 --> 00:18:50.380
<v Speaker 6>and there were two drivers with me cause we had to double time to get to</v>

695
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.223
<v Speaker 6>Montreal,</v>

696
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 6>Clovis and Thomas.</v>

697
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.903
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

698
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.773
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

699
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 6>they open the front door and as soon as the door opens,</v>

700
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.101
<v Speaker 6>they smelled weed.</v>

701
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:01.390
<v Speaker 6>I didn't have the fucking blowers on the bus at that point.</v>

702
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.881
<v Speaker 6>And they're just like,</v>

703
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:03.714
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>

704
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 6>smells like dope in here.</v>

705
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:06.841
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

706
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:07.081
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

707
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 6>there was a lot,</v>

708
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 6>but not anymore.</v>

709
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 6>I smoked it obviously before we come here and why bring sand to the beach</v>

710
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.251
<v Speaker 6>literally?</v>

711
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:15.010
<v Speaker 6>And the guy goes,</v>

712
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.843
<v Speaker 6>get off the bus.</v>

713
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.730
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know it'd be a big deal and shit.</v>

714
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.390
<v Speaker 6>So I was in a bathroom,</v>

715
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 6>I didn't think it through,</v>

716
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.850
<v Speaker 6>is it a bathroom?</v>

717
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:24.151
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

718
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 6>my slippers on cause I had just been sleeping and they took us inside and they</v>

719
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 6>took the bus apart,</v>

720
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.060
<v Speaker 6>went through it,</v>

721
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 6>whatnot.</v>

722
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.040
<v Speaker 6>And there was no weed on the bus froze.</v>

723
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.270

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.863
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that shit that's going on with Katt Williams?</v>

887
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.500

<v Speaker 1>Those are my favorites.</v>

977
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.873
<v Speaker 1>One Star,</v>

978
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.230
<v Speaker 1>one star review is a,</v>

979

<v Speaker 1>and strangling kit.</v>

981
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a secret or you've done some crazy,</v>

982
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:33.761
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

983
00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:34.870
<v Speaker 1>do you have a tango record?</v>

984
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>World Tango Record,</v>

985
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.200
<v Speaker 1>tango spins.</v>

986
00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:39.011
<v Speaker 1>And I did a thing.</v>

987
00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:44.011
<v Speaker 1>It was sent 34 to 34 37 spins on and Kelly actually spends a one minute.</v>

988
00:26:45.731 --> 00:26:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

989
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh that was the record.</v>

990
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.110
<v Speaker 1>They do it in one minute with a partner who travels around you in a diameters</v>

991
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but 10 12 feet.</v>

992
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So it takes more time than people would take.</v>

993
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 1>How long did you learn how to do that?</v>

994
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Go into this six months in Argentina,</v>

995
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

996
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Eight hours a day of tango until my feet were black on the bottom.</v>

997
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.063
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

998
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 1>34 you've been everywhere too.</v>

999
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.011
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1000
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

1001
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 1>how many different countries you've been to this 35 I had to count them out</v>

1002
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 1>because to get a visa for India,</v>

1003
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 1>they make you list every country had been to in the last 10 years,</v>

1004
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 1>even though the only thing that I want to know is are you a terrorist from</v>

1005
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan?</v>

1006
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.580
<v Speaker 1>So they could just ask you,</v>

1007
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.401
<v Speaker 1>have you been to Pakistan?</v>

1008
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:20.611
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1009
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.530
<v Speaker 1>they were like lifts out every country you've been in the last 10 years.</v>

1010
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So I counted up about 35 same.</v>

1011
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 1>How do you have the time to do that?</v>

1012
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1013
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.570
<v Speaker 1>These days.</v>

1014
00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I ain't used to bounce around online to short trips.</v>

1015
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I find that tiring now.</v>

1016
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I'd just like to relocate for a few months at a time if I'm going to do it at</v>

1017
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:35.950
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1018
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1019
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see.</v>

1020
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 1>But I like,</v>

1021
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I do like relocating it cause like the first time I went abroad at all really it</v>

1022
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 1>was a year in Japan as an exchange student and I was introduced judo.</v>

1023
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 1>That was where I lived with a Japanese family and one I relocate like that for</v>

1024
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>me at least,</v>

1025
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 1>it shows me how much my behavior is just arbitrary.</v>

1026
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Like driving on one side of the street,</v>

1027
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1028
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 1>let's say soaping down in a shower as opposed to before a bath.</v>

1029
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all just culturally reinforced and so I find it fun to look through</v>

1030
00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 1>my life again through a fresh lens when I get back to the u s I think that's,</v>

1031
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.420
<v Speaker 1>that's really fun.</v>

1032
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:08.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:28:08.651 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It's always amazed me how different cultures are when I've only been to maybe</v>

1034
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 1>six or seven different countries,</v>

1035
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but like the difference between the way people behave in Brazil as opposed to</v>

1036
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 1>the way they were here to Germany and I was supposed to wear it.</v>

1037
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:19.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1038
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it says amazing man.</v>

1039
00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how people vary and how adaptable we are to both our environment</v>

1040
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:25.951
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1041
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And you just get used to certain things,</v>

1042
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1043
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember was staying with this German family and we were watching the</v>

1044
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Simpsons and because it's dubbed into German,</v>

1045
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1046
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 1>oh the Simpsons or from the u s like I thought it was German.</v>

1047
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's funny.</v>

1048
00:28:38.081 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause they had only seen it in German on German television.</v>

1049
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:40.831
<v Speaker 1>Do they,</v>

1050
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 1>how do they translate the jugs?</v>

1051
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:42.804
<v Speaker 1>Do you speak German?</v>

1052
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I speak uh,</v>

1053
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.700
<v Speaker 1>pretty mediocre German get to judge Schultz.</v>

1054
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't translate.</v>

1055
00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1056
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:48.781
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I mean?</v>

1057
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:49.450
<v Speaker 1>They just don't,</v>

1058
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 1>they're so subtle and they're also like these weird cultural references to,</v>

1059
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.760
<v Speaker 1>does German efficient,</v>

1060
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 1>do they have any stand up in Germany?</v>

1061
00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen standup in Germany.</v>

1062
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen standup in Japan,</v>

1063
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:01.584
<v Speaker 1>which is cool.</v>

1064
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Traditional Japanese standard where they have two guys like kneeling down or</v>

1065
00:29:05.431 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>sitting on pads and there are traditional Kimonos and it's just two guys</v>

1066
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 1>bantering back and forth.</v>

1067
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 1>That standup comedy in Japan.</v>

1068
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>

1069
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:14.941
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1070
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's all nice and Kimona.</v>

1071
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1072
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll like do like the sort of judo,</v>

1073
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu style and kneeling on the feet and then they'll just sit there like a</v>

1074
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 1>fan and why each other on the head and do this banter back and forth.</v>

1075
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1076
00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 1>so they always do it with another person.</v>

1077
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1078
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.270
<v Speaker 1>They're still in sort of a VOD village sort of overlap.</v>

1079
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So they do a lot of slapstick,</v>

1080
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.020
<v Speaker 1>ton of slapstick ties.</v>

1081
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how cultures,</v>

1082
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:33.983
<v Speaker 1>like some cultures are,</v>

1083
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how like America is so stand up comedy heavy,</v>

1085
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 1>know so many standup comics come.</v>

1086
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them come from England,</v>

1087
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:43.211
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them comfortable.</v>

1088
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 1>But you never hear about this down at talks from Germany.</v>

1089
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>You know we had one that used to come to the comedy store.</v>

1090
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He was like famous in Germany.</v>

1091
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 1>He was like on a television show,</v>

1092
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to come to America to make it.</v>

1093
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 1>But everything he did was like crazy physical.</v>

1094
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It was all like flying through the air and fall on his head.</v>

1095
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It was all weird,</v>

1096
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.360
<v Speaker 1>nutty shit.</v>

1097
00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Pulling stuff out of bags,</v>

1098
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:01.080
<v Speaker 1>smashing it'll together and noises.</v>

1099
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.923
<v Speaker 1>Sound effects.</v>

1100
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like their sense of humors,</v>

1101
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.780
<v Speaker 1>alien to our Q and German sense of humor is very different in the US for sure.</v>

1102
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's still English,</v>

1103
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 1>English sense of humor almost relies on a higher level of politeness than we</v>

1104
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:16.834
<v Speaker 1>currently enjoy.</v>

1105
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Their whole this,</v>

1106
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>the pacing of their humor,</v>

1107
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:20.531
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1108
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Replot relies on being polite.</v>

1109
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Is there any non us place like kind of about Scotland,</v>

1110
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:28.114
<v Speaker 1>Wales,</v>

1111
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>UK or Britain?</v>

1112
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Is there anywhere outside of the u s produces consistently good Kardex or</v>

1113
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Australia has some good ones.</v>

1114
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1115
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Australia has some Australia also rugged cats,</v>

1116
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you know they have some wild dudes so Australia is like,</v>

1117
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 1>it's make sense of data when people are like what the fuck's going on?</v>

1118
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And they write it and it's like,</v>

1119
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.361
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

1120
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 1>That they would like Jim Jefferies,</v>

1122
00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:48.461
<v Speaker 1>a great comic.</v>

1123
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.294
<v Speaker 1>He's from Australia.</v>

1124
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.133
<v Speaker 1>There's another dude,</v>

1125
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name but real funny guys from Australia because a few,</v>

1126
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.320
<v Speaker 1>they have like seen down there too.</v>

1127
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>We performed a Sydney,</v>

1128
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:58.390
<v Speaker 1>they've got a real comedy club down there.</v>

1129
00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes it needs a great city.</v>

1130
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1131
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 1>he's an unemployed so I live the apocalypse head.</v>

1132
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.013
<v Speaker 1>It's a good move.</v>

1133
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:04.901
<v Speaker 1>So it's out there.</v>

1134
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:05.734
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty far away.</v>

1135
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.993
<v Speaker 1>How much of a target?</v>

1136
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Except crocodiles and fucking snakes and shit.</v>

1138
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Poisonous spiders and the fact that 80% of the country's uninhabitable.</v>

1139
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:14.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1140
00:31:14.661 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1141
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I think you can only live around the edges and the inside you'll go by people</v>

1143
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 1>who get killed by other animals might get killed by people you might get killed</v>
