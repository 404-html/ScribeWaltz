17
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.620

18
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.210

<v Speaker 1>is gay.</v>

40
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>As Gay,</v>

41
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>as gay as the day is beautiful and long and flower smell pretty and butterflies</v>

42
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:12.901
<v Speaker 1>are beautiful.</v>

43
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>That guy's gay.</v>

44
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I let you,</v>

45
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>he can suck enough dick.</v>

46
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.591
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

47
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>If you could just just give him a free pass.</v>

48
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>If you ever got that guy liquored up and put a heart on in front of him,</v>

49
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>he would jump on it.</v>

50
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Like Greg Louganis off the top peer swan dive on that.</v>

51
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 2>His head would be spinning a out of a gain and he'd still get some tongue on the</v>

52
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 2>shaft.</v>

53
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>He would automatically start salivating to the point where it was like a</v>

54
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>waterfall coming out of his mouth pouring down his shirt.</v>

55
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Just so alive.</v>

56
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.473
<v Speaker 1>Long story,</v>

57
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 2>you would know where the pool started and the saliva for Dick starts coming out</v>

58
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

59
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>it would literally be like a saliva waterfall and like when not when people have</v>

61
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>a backyard and they have those really like,</v>

62
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>like fancy little rock formations where the water comes down into their pool.</v>

63
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're really fancy schmancy.</v>

64
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:04.154
<v Speaker 1>That was his mouth.</v>

65
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

67
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 2>he would say to a young man,</v>

68
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go in the hot tub with me?</v>

69
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.481
<v Speaker 2>And the guy would go,</v>

70
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:08.901
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

71
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 2>they'd get in the hot tub and the guy we go,</v>

72
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>there's no water in here,</v>

73
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.343
<v Speaker 2>and he'd go,</v>

74
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.243
<v Speaker 2>just wait,</v>

75
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 2>let me see your cock</v>

76

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 2>It's comes out 96 degrees.</v>

78
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I'd let them blow me if I knew that I could take down Michelle Bachmann</v>

79
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 2>particular down.</v>

80
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>From what though?</v>

81
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Just because she will be an elected leader.</v>

82
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:31.394
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

83

<v Speaker 2>pundits they go to for comments on shit.</v>

88
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.930

89
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:45.764
<v Speaker 2>enacted.</v>

90
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 2>So what's the stopper?</v>

91
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.500

93
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>

94
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.813

95
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.570

<v Speaker 2>you're already like 60.</v>

114
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 2>He's probably actually probably having a lot of gay sex.</v>

115
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>He's just not telling her dad he's having a lot of gay sex.</v>

116
00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's similar with a lot of celebrities.</v>

117
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mention names like say Oprah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've heard rumors.</v>

124
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 2>He always have to substantiate things like that.</v>

125
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I've heard rumors that he looks extremely gay.</v>

126
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:38.910
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

132
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

149
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

150
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Motivational speeches.</v>

151
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

152
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever you would do.</v>

153
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>This is how you find a really which powerful woman and just connect to her.</v>

154
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's [inaudible] people look,</v>

155
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.451
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

156
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the guys are really brilliant,</v>

157
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.461
<v Speaker 1>intelligent guy.</v>

158
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it doesn't give a fuck about money.</v>

159
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just enlightened.</v>

160
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.221
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

161
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:33.641
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

162
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.001
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

163
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I know dudes that are like that,</v>

164
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>that are with really strong women and they are totally cool with it.</v>

165
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

166
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>they find them and you know,</v>

167
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 2>in chanting and humorous and they go for the ride.</v>

168
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.131
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

169
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I guess for us we're kind of Alpha males,</v>

170
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>so I think it would be difficult for us to picture of being in the backseat</v>

171
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe and maybe not.</v>

172
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

173
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard when you say like that this would work or that would work</v>

174
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>generalizing because there's people in my life that on paper I shouldn't like</v>

175
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

176
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And I fucking love them.</v>

177
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

178
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>This relationships that I've had with people that despite all the craziness,</v>

179
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the fuck out of my time with them and you know,</v>

180
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes in a more intense way,</v>

181
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 1>even though it wasn't like,</v>

182
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't anything that had legs like they could actually lasts.</v>

183
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:18.511
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

184
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:22.290
<v Speaker 1>cause after a while you have real relationships where you could actually go on</v>

185
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>vacation with someone.</v>

186
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

187
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when you first started going vacation with girlfriends and like</v>

188
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>three or four days and you're like,</v>

189
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

190
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I need a jump out of a fucking window now.</v>

191
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

192
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

193
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I had a girl that I faked a phone call.</v>

194
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.660
<v Speaker 1>My friend called me up.</v>

195
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I faked an obligation to get rid of her.</v>

196
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.280
<v Speaker 1>She came to stay with me for the weekend,</v>

197
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:46.281
<v Speaker 1>just for the weekend and two days in she was complaining about everything to the</v>

198
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 1>point where it's was like there was no fun to be had.</v>

199
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Everything was just a complaint,</v>

200
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the music,</v>

201
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.060
<v Speaker 1>complaining about where we're going to go to eat,</v>

202
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 1>complaining about every fucking thing.</v>

203
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

204
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I was panicking.</v>

205
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>My friend called me up and,</v>

206
00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

207
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.501
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

208
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:00.651
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

209
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>what's up man?</v>

210
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

211
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

212
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I forgot shit.</v>

213
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

214
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I got to come get you all.</v>

215
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

216
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.214
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

217
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>This is my friend Johnny who's quite a slit character.</v>

218
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

219
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.251
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

220
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I can it.</v>

221
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.121
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

222
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.491
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

223
00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:12.324
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing over there?</v>

224
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.423
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

225
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.383
<v Speaker 1>Bethany's here.</v>

226
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.961
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

227
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Speaker 1>Is that her name?</v>

228
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.633
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

229
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>A nice person.</v>

230
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>But it was the wrong time for both of us.</v>

231
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.371
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

232
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I was a fucking pain in the ass then too.</v>

233
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the problems.</v>

234
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I was a fucking,</v>

235
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it too.</v>

236
00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you're a young man,</v>

237
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be hard for you to travel with anybody but other young men,</v>

238
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:33.181
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

239
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:34.710
<v Speaker 2>you are a fucking explore.</v>

240
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>You want to really go nuts and</v>

241
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

242
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.421
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

243
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you're dumb.</v>

244
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.331
<v Speaker 1>I was 20,</v>

246
00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:40.121
<v Speaker 1>I was 24,</v>

247
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it was maybe 23 at the time.</v>

248
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I was so stupid.</v>

249
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was so sick and crazy and it was doing me like two years removed from</v>

251
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:48.724
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

252
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.420
<v Speaker 1>So my brain was hardwired the wrong way.</v>

253
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to rewire it.</v>

254
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>My brain was,</v>

255
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 1>was wired for violent competition and then breaks in between that.</v>

256
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that was my whole life.</v>

257
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So going from that to like the like being around girls and relationships and</v>

258
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>trying to manage those waters was very confusing for me because,</v>

259
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 1>but fighting was such like a solitary pursuit.</v>

260
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:13.024
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

261
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.083
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

262
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I used to keep journals,</v>

263
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 2>up until probably when I was like 23 or something,</v>

265
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>but I was dating this girl and we went to Europe together.</v>

266
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

267
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it was like after Sophomore Year of college that summer she had,</v>

268
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 2>she had studied abroad in,</v>

269
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 2>in Austria for the second semester.</v>

270
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>So I saved us some cash and I flew over there and we met in London and we went</v>

271
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:38.291
<v Speaker 2>to Ireland and we went to France and I was fucking miserable and I was keeping a</v>

272
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 2>journal and I look back at it now and it wasn't her,</v>

273
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 2>it was just that like I just wanted to do my own fucking thing.</v>

274
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't into negotiating and compromising because at that age you feel like</v>

275
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 2>life is so short,</v>

276
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to waste a day.</v>

277
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>You just feel like whatever the most exciting thing is,</v>

278
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want to be doing.</v>

279
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's often not what comes out in the copy.</v>

280
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.210
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely that.</v>

281
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:01.901
<v Speaker 1>But this is also,</v>

282
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I was just selfish.</v>

283
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do what anybody else.</v>

285
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's what we're both saying.</v>

286
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

287
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't even that I was thinking,</v>

288
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:09.971
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

289
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>life is short.</v>

290
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a romantic,</v>

291
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it was like totally egotistical.</v>

292
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

293
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look back,</v>

294
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 1>like if you had to go back in time and be yourself when you were 23 or 22 years</v>

295
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

296
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 1>like what a fucking mess that would be.</v>

297
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd be like,</v>

298
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:23.921
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

299
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to deal with?</v>

300
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

302
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>you would like look at the relationships that you'd try to manage.</v>

303
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck mess you created and that you're just such a different human</v>

304
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>now than you were then.</v>

305
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 2>You spend so much energy on relationships back then.</v>

306
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you man,</v>

307
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.090
<v Speaker 1>having like a relationship,</v>

308
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.051
<v Speaker 1>like a special,</v>

309
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:46.051
<v Speaker 1>like when you were 16 the amount emotionally I grew from like 16 to like 18</v>

310
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.160
<v Speaker 1>which was during the term that I had this girl as a girlfriend.</v>

311
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>She was a very nice person too.</v>

312
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.673
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

313
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 1>she was not a mean nasty in any way,</v>

314
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>which was really nice as well.</v>

315
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I dated some girls after that were,</v>

316
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they were mean and nasty and when it will first time a girl in salt you,</v>

317
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

318
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing,</v>

319
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>because like sh this.</v>

321
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>My first girlfriend never would do that.</v>

322
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 1>She was very smart as well and like we would have conversations,</v>

323
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they were interesting conversations,</v>

324
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>but there was no manipulation.</v>

325
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.374
<v Speaker 1>There's no weirdness.</v>

326
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I dated this girl about a year later that was the opposite.</v>

327
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>She was very nice.</v>

328
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>She was very pretty unfortunately for her because it gave her this fucking,</v>

329
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>this ability to list constantly have men around her constantly have people</v>

330
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>hitting on her.</v>

331
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>But she knew how to fuck with you and like you would see it happened.</v>

332
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>She would say something like he was your nose always that crooked.</v>

333
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And I was just going to what?</v>

334
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

335
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.014
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

336
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember thinking,</v>

337
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:44.240
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that like,</v>

338
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

339
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

340
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

341
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>She would say shit like that.</v>

342
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Like all the time,</v>

343
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.923
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

344
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:50.801 --> 00:09:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Weird Shit.</v>

346
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you see bad marriages is when,</v>

347
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.960
<v Speaker 2>when either person and salts,</v>

348
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:57.040
<v Speaker 2>the other one it's like,</v>

349
00:09:57.041 --> 00:09:57.641
<v Speaker 2>unless it's,</v>

350
00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you really get that,</v>

351
00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:01.240
<v Speaker 2>that's their stack and they fuck around and bust each other's balls.</v>

352
00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

353
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>But when you see the guy get a little bit,</v>

354
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 2>damaged by it,</v>

356
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:07.540
<v Speaker 2>you just think God,</v>

357
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.523
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

358
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

359
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

360
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 1>the girl getting damaged out of it,</v>

361
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>he has even more like tension because there's a physical violence worry,</v>

362
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know women do violence on men.</v>

364
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean I lost a very good friend and Phil Hartman for that very thing.</v>

365
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>His wife shot him while I was in his sleep and that was a horrible relationship</v>

366
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.790
<v Speaker 1>and that was a relationship where his ex wife used to do subtle shit to insult</v>

367
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>him in front of large groups of people.</v>

368
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Like she would chew chip him down because she was a failed actress and you know,</v>

369
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Phil was a superstar,</v>

370
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.570
<v Speaker 1>was coming up Saturday night live.</v>

371
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly movies and you know,</v>

372
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.363
<v Speaker 1>he was just a,</v>

373
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 1>well like a deeply loved guy.</v>

374
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>And so she would take,</v>

375
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>he would take her to parties and she would take that opportunity to assault him</v>

376
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.131
<v Speaker 1>in front of people,</v>

377
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.570
<v Speaker 1>like in real subtle ways like acuity.</v>

378
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about cars because Phil was like a car nut and he bought a Ferrari</v>

379
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and he was so happy he bought this car.</v>

380
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Like he saved up his money and he's like a big deal for him.</v>

381
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:05.431
<v Speaker 1>He saved his money,</v>

382
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>made from a couple of movies and he always wanted one of these things.</v>

383
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>And the way he would talk about it,</v>

384
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>like he was a very interesting guy,</v>

385
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.511
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

386
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:13.201
<v Speaker 1>very smart,</v>

387
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>smoked weed and it would get like real crazy about shit,</v>

388
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>like really into things and have these wild conversations and like kid who's a</v>

389
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:20.311
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

390
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>like he loved things.</v>

391
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>He loved becoming a pilot.</v>

392
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Like he became a pilot while we were doing news radio.</v>

393
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And I remember seeing them sitting there like studying due to flee all these</v>

394
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>aviation books.</v>

395
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm way to add for that,</v>

396
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:32.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

397
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 1>But this guy would study and like his lines,</v>

398
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>like when we had a scene,</v>

399
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:39.460
<v Speaker 1>he would study his lines over and over and over and over.</v>

400
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And he was sitting like a consummate professional and Lee Scott.</v>

401
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>So when he was talking about this Ferrari,</v>

402
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>it was about the Italian engineering and the shape of it and the sound of the</v>

403
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:48.880
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>

404
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>The whole experience was everything he had just,</v>

405
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and so she goes,</v>

406
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I like trucks.</v>

407
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

408
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>my ex boyfriend had a truck,</v>

409
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>my boyfriend's back home had trucks.</v>

410
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.190
<v Speaker 1>And so what is he thinking when he,</v>

411
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.861
<v Speaker 1>what do I hear?</v>

412
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:07.861
<v Speaker 1>What I hear is she's talking about these dudes who were probably truck I</v>

413

418
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.840

419
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:17.674

00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

436
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that's just a gross thing to say.</v>

437
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

438
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And you get that from your parents.</v>

439
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:42.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

440
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 2>they model it for you.</v>

441
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 2>How you're going to treat your spouse is like,</v>

442
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I see it every fucking time.</v>

443
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I was hanging out with a friend a couple of nights ago and the parents were</v>

444
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 2>around the,</v>

445
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.241
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

446
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

447
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>his inlaws were around and I could see the way they treat each other.</v>

448
00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

449
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

450
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.233
<v Speaker 2>that's your marriage.</v>

451
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.133
<v Speaker 2>That's how your wife,</v>

452
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

453
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.783
<v Speaker 1>it's so true.</v>

454
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.591
<v Speaker 2>So my parents,</v>

455
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

456
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 2>they really respected each other.</v>

457
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Like they never,</v>

458
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.761
<v Speaker 2>they never did that.</v>

459
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 2>They kicked it around a lot,</v>

460
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but it was so obviously fun what they were doing.</v>

461
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And they really respected each other.</v>

462
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 2>They never took shots in public.</v>

463
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>And when they had to,</v>

464
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 2>if they had to have a serious discussion and it wasn't yelling,</v>

465
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 2>they would wait till we went to bed.</v>

466
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 2>They go on the other side of the house,</v>

467
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 2>closed the door,</v>

468
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 2>and we heard muffled,</v>

469
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.443
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

470
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like some people just Sir fucking argument in front of their kids,</v>

471
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:28.601
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

472
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:28.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>that's what your kids are going to do when they grow up.</v>

474
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

475
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

477
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>that's super important,</v>

478
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:33.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

479
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It's super important to show them the model of what's possible and if you're in</v>

480
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 1>a bad relationship,</v>

481
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just as equally important to get out.</v>

482
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

483
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the really important things my mother taught me when I was a little kid</v>

484
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 1>is getting out of a relationship.</v>

485
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>When we were five,</v>

486
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 1>she moved to Sim with my grandmother,</v>

487
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and then we got an apartment.</v>

488
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 1>We moved out of my dad's place because her and my dad were involved in this,</v>

489
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>a abusive relationship.</v>

490
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.210
<v Speaker 1>So I remember thinking that like,</v>

491
00:13:58.211 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

492
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 1>like my mom was smart.</v>

493
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>She does the right thing.</v>

494
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:02.111
<v Speaker 1>When Shit goes wrong,</v>

495
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't just take it.</v>

496
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.110
<v Speaker 1>She has options out.</v>

497
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 1>She figures a way out of it,</v>

498
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>even with two kids,</v>

499
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

500
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 1>So it took a lot of courage to do,</v>

501
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.541
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say balls,</v>

502
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:11.374
<v Speaker 1>but that's ridiculous.</v>

503
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
