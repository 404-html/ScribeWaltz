1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what's amazing is,</v>

3
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.350
<v Speaker 1>how well kids can manipulate their body to my,</v>

5
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>my daughter can do a,</v>

6
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:08.221
<v Speaker 1>what is that called?</v>

7
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>When you put your feet on the ground,</v>

8
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>your back bends and you put your hand.</v>

9
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:11.971
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

11
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>A little spines are so incredibly flexible and you know,</v>

12
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and she can go up on their tippy toes and she's only six.</v>

13
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>She can also climb a rope.</v>

14
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a rope in my garage.</v>

15
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You've seen my garage is preeclampsia the only great,</v>

16
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>she grabs that rub and climbs all the way to the top.</v>

17
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And I was watching her do that.</v>

18
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

19
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>how many women can do that?</v>

20
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Like she's a tiny little girl.</v>

21
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:30.234
<v Speaker 1>She's six.</v>

22
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Like how many grown women can support their own weight like that and climb a</v>

23
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>budge?</v>

24
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Grown man can't do it.</v>

25
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.911
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

26
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Most my,</v>

27
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>most grown men,</v>

29
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't climb a rope if their life actually dependent on it.</v>

30
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.264
<v Speaker 1>And that's sad.</v>

32
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.103
<v Speaker 1>It is sad.</v>

33
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the best things I ever did for my kid.</v>

34
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I just hung a rope in our foyer of our house.</v>

35
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>We had like one of those cargo architecturally designed houses that the kitchen</v>

36
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>went up three fours,</v>

37
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:55.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

39
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

40
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>by level type thing,</v>

43
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.433
<v Speaker 1>split level.</v>

44
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

45
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>took my life in my own hands with my drill.</v>

46
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Tried to hang that damn broke man.</v>

47
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I tied myself a with my Jujitsu about and was leaning over the back and he tried</v>

48
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>to find a,</v>

49
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>a beam with a beam finder and the,</v>

50
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.043
<v Speaker 1>got the drill.</v>

52
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>This is all while they actually wife was out of the house.</v>

53
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>She comes home,</v>

54
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>she has this rope hanging down in the middle of her foyer by our kitchen.</v>

55
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.973
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

56
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I got both kids climbing.</v>

58
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>That rope is at the beginning of the divorce proceedings.</v>

59
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Probably my whole,</v>

60
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>for the moment I said I do with the beginning of the divorce proceeding.</v>

61
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

62
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

63
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's just the idea of getting married,</v>

64
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

65
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be normal.</v>

66
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be like everybody else.</v>

67
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get married.</v>

68
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>it'll work out once we're married or workout.</v>

70
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.031
<v Speaker 1>It never does,</v>

71
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

72
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I preferred and marriage.</v>

73
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.783
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

74
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And unmarried is where I have my money.</v>

75
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>She has hers,</v>

76
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I got my credit card,</v>

77
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.973
<v Speaker 1>she has hers,</v>

78
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I have my possessions,</v>

79
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.574
<v Speaker 1>she has hers.</v>

80
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't tell her what to do.</v>

81
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't tell me what to do.</v>

82
00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like an agreement.</v>

84
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>We're together because we want to be together.</v>

85
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>We don't need a government agency to tell us that we can live together and we</v>

86
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't need a government agency telling us that we're allowed to be a</v>

87
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

88
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound very romantic stuff.</v>

90
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of woman's can accept that,</v>

91
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you right now,</v>

92
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I am not going to,</v>

93
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.541
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now,</v>

94
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

95
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I want a traditional marriage.</v>

96
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I know we won't be able to tell my friends and I'm married.</v>

97
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.071
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

98
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Chicks love to tell their friends who married,</v>

99
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>very few guys like you're excited to tell their friends they're getting married.</v>

100
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.341
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

101
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:29.671
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

102
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:30.504
<v Speaker 1>I got her.</v>

103
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>She's marrying me.</v>

104
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

105
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.931
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

107
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:34.171
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>

108
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:34.471
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

109
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:35.131
<v Speaker 1>We're getting married.</v>

110
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:35.281
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

111
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:35.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

113
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's never like this milestone accomplishment.</v>

114
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:40.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

115
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.071
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

116
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you pulled it off,</v>

117
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.871
<v Speaker 1>but a girl will like,</v>

118
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

119
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding me.</v>

120
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

121
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

122
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe in girls.</v>

123
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>They get so excited.</v>

124
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy for you.</v>

125
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.914
<v Speaker 1>They'll hug.</v>

126
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete different experience for the male.</v>

127
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Women have got it in their head,</v>

128
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>which some I should say because of movies and of the stories.</v>

129
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You know this romantic happily ever after idea that they have to,</v>

130
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>they have to get legally bound.</v>

131
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.073
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of it as,</v>

132
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

134
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>The way you look at it as so harsh and so jaded.</v>

135
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not a legal contract.</v>

136
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

137
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful agreement and it's you take your relationship to a next level.</v>

138
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Until you hit those divorce proceedings and then you realize,</v>

140
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.401
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

141
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>this is a contract.</v>

142
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a legal contract with the state,</v>

143
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>and now I've got to bring in lawyers and we've got to figure out how to fucking</v>

144
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>divvy up my money and the lawyers get a giant chunk of that action.</v>

145
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the big scam.</v>

146
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what's when I'm Phil Hartman,</v>

147
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>before his wife killed him,</v>

148
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>when he was trying to get divorced,</v>

149
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>shot him in his sleep.</v>

150
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.153
<v Speaker 1>He um,</v>

151
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>was ranting to me,</v>

152
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>but I go just fucking give her half and he was like,</v>

153
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.091
<v Speaker 1>it's not a half.</v>

154
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.924
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

155
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a third because the lawyers get a third too.</v>

156
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You'll lose two thirds.</v>

157
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not half pretty much man.</v>

158
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It was just steam it as well.</v>

159
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I like done the non marriage,</v>

160
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>that's nice than non marriage.</v>

162
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>The line keeps their own personality and you don't like just get all wrapped up.</v>

163
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.971
<v Speaker 1>See this Guy Jamie was showing me these yesterday's Russian oligarch 4.5</v>

164
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

165
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I in a divorce.</v>

166
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.241
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

167
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you have billions in Bellin's is probably not that big of a deal.</v>

168
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

169
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

170
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.340
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much money you got,</v>

171
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>the idea that some chick is going to be going off bang another dudes with your</v>

172
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:29.241
<v Speaker 1>money and riding Ferrari's and flying private jets everywhere and buying castles</v>

173
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>all with your cash.</v>

174
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.871
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

175
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Because he had sex with her.</v>

176
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess they don't have prenups in Russia or if they do,</v>

177
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get one.</v>

178
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:38.900
<v Speaker 1>he's just maybe thought it was going to be,</v>

180
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be different man.</v>

181
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all the other 50% of the people that could make it.</v>

182
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even hedging my bets.</v>

183
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm all in.</v>

184
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>He pushed all his chips on the table and you know,</v>

185
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I think sours a lot of marriages,</v>

186
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and I can speak from experience because I've been married and divorced three</v>

187
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:54.834
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

188
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 1>three times,</v>

189
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>three times.</v>

190
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>You fucking crazy,</v>

191
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.441
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

193
00:04:58.441 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back from Warren.</v>

194
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I finally got smart.</v>

195
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

196
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.253
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.523

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>a woman who was the,</v>

205
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.231
<v Speaker 1>what I call it,</v>

206
00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:13.064
<v Speaker 1>the girl,</v>

207
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 1>really fun to be around very,</v>

209
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.903
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

211
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>just you relate to,</v>

213
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.180
<v Speaker 1>together as friends and then what do we do?</v>

215
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>We turn around and change her into a mother,</v>

216
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 1>and mother is a whole different animal,</v>

218
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>a whole different being than that girl that,</v>

219
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

220
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

221
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

222
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 1>that young girl that was carefree and Yup.</v>

223
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>And Fun to be around.</v>

224
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And you go to the movies and you'd go out and you'd play and you'd just have a</v>

225
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:47.210
<v Speaker 1>great time and all that just goes right out the window once you turn her into a</v>

226
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

227
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not even talking about kids,</v>

228
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I've seen plenty of people without kids.</v>

230
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 1>The woman's still becomes the mother.</v>

231
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

232
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

233
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.310
<v Speaker 1>like a mother substitute.</v>

234
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

235
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>they become a dominant role.</v>

236
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 1>The man's decision making and they sort of Cook,</v>

237
00:05:59.441 --> 00:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Cook,</v>

238
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>control him in a very motherly way.</v>

239
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that becomes very unattractive to women too.</v>

240
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think a lot of women,</v>

241
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>like the man that they didn't like that role.</v>

242
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

243
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to be put into that role.</v>

244
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of women,</v>

246
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

248
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>they had like a strong guy that kind of take care of them.</v>

249
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

250
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.991
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

252
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

253
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to generalize,</v>

254
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:17.250
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

255
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>what I've seen from the women that dominate the men,</v>

256
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.231
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

257
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>like the guys that I know with a woman tells him what to do.</v>

258
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>And those guys also have a hard time getting sex.</v>

259
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Like almost universally,</v>

260
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>

261
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a rule.</v>

262
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if the woman dominates and the woman tells you what to do and the woman</v>

263
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>does control your spending and controls,</v>

264
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you know what your hobbies are and tells you what's going to happen and where</v>

265
00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:38.604
<v Speaker 1>are you going to go.</v>

266
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Those guys don't get much sex.</v>

267
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that's related to like a woman being attracted to a man that</v>

268
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>she can't control or not attracted to a man she can control rather well.</v>

269
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 1>The mother doesn't like sex.</v>

270
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>The mother is against sex.</v>

271
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens so often in these marriages.</v>

272
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.481
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

273
00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of women that are misuses and you know,</v>

274
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

275
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>body workers and man,</v>

276
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

277
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 1>they tell me it's uncanny how many other male clients will always proposition</v>

279
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 1>and tried to rankle sex out of them,</v>

280
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>raising legitimate.</v>

281
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

282
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about prostitutes.</v>

283
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.591
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

284
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:15.831
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

285
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

286
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's pretty common.</v>

287
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Guys are just sex starved.</v>

289
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Did their relationships,</v>

290
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 1>their marriages.</v>

291
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that really used to rankle me most more than anything was the way</v>

292
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>women would not want to be.</v>

293
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>They would want to separate their guys from their,</v>

294
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.621
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

295
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.454
<v Speaker 1>their friends.</v>

296
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And they really resented the fact that God has come to two Shitzu trading as it</v>

297
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>got the owned it you,</v>

298
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.543
<v Speaker 1>she's at school,</v>

299
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

300
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

301
00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>the wives and girlfriends would give the guys such a hard time about gone and</v>

302
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>train it.</v>

303
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

304
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>they should be encouraged and they got to go as much as possible.</v>

305
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.221
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

306
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>they pulled these guys out of there and that's a damn shame to do that to a guy.</v>

307
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's also damn shame for a guy to pull his woman out of something that she loves</v>

308
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

309
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh well yeah,</v>

310
00:07:59.301 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

311
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

312
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>

313
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.191
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

314
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:01.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

315
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:01.561
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

316
00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing when people try to change the person who they're,</v>

317
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>they love and control them.</v>

318
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

319
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine your friend doing that to you?</v>

320
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Like a friend going,</v>

321

323
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>What are you working out for?</v>

324
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you working out.</v>

325
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

326
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you working out.</v>

327
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You're my friend.</v>

328
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.053
<v Speaker 1>You're coming with me.</v>

329
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>And like what?</v>

330
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like you camping,</v>

331
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>camping,</v>

332
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you know I don't like you going to ball games.</v>

333
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:22.671
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

334
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking crazy?</v>

335
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>But when that friend happens to be someone that you have sex with or you're</v>

336
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>romantically connected to girlfriend,</v>

337
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:31.761
<v Speaker 1>fiance,</v>

338
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.091
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

339
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

340
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>that person all of a sudden has a some sort of a role they can dictate like your</v>

341
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>actual day,</v>

342
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>like dictate what you do,</v>

343
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a guy doing it to a wife or a girlfriend or a woman doing it to her</v>

344
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:45.131
<v Speaker 1>husband or her boyfriend.</v>

345
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that people just sort of accept ed the Ed and it happens so</v>

346
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>often and it's always gross.</v>

347
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 1>No wonder that divorces at its all time highs,</v>

348
00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

349
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Fucking idiots.</v>

350
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.560
<v Speaker 1>All of us to three jobs.</v>

351
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you think about on number three when that one failed and you like,</v>

352
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.751
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

353
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with me?</v>

354
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I do this three times?</v>

355
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

356
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

357
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.220
<v Speaker 1>damn you,</v>

358
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

359
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of shame actually,</v>

360
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of feelings of</v>

361
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>unworthiness or whatever,</v>

362
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

363
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I like the feeling of being a failure and all that,</v>

364
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and then I just realized,</v>

365
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:21.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>some people just aren't cut out.</v>

368
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I should have never been in that situation the first.</v>

369
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.633
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

370
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
