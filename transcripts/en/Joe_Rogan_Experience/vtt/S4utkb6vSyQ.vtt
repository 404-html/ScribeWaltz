29
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been extra weirded out over the </v>

30
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 2>last couple months and I just got back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Mexico,</v>

31
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 2>was on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do shit for a week and in not </v>

32
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.751
<v Speaker 2>doing anything for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really got a chance to sit down and </v>

33
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 2>think about stuff and I'm more weirded </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by life today than I think I ever </v>

34
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.491
<v Speaker 2>have been before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm excited to have you on because I </v>

35
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.641
<v Speaker 2>want to hear your story because Sam has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been telling me about it and I looked </v>

36
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 2>into it and please explain like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you,</v>

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 2>like where you were and what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

38
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a,</v>

39
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.740
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the panic attack.</v>

40
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 3>It was 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a little show that we do at ABC</v>

41
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 3>news called Good Morning America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big shots,</v>

42
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 3>a big show show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a little show.</v>

43
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the job that I was filling </v>

44
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.021
<v Speaker 3>in as the news reader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the person who comes on at the </v>

45
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:49.021
<v Speaker 3>top of each hour and reason the </v>
<v Speaker 3>headlines.</v>

46
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And I just freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just lost it.</v>

47
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 3>So as a couple seconds into it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to get really scared and it </v>

48
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

49
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever had a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever had a panic?</v>

50
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like anxiety on steroids,</v>

51
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 3>so you start to worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then your fight or flight instincts </v>

52
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 3>kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

53
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your lungs seize up,</v>

54
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 3>your palms start sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mouth dries up,</v>

55
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 3>your heart is racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind is racing.</v>

56
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't breathe and therefore </v>

57
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 3>couldn't speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a couple of seconds into reading what</v>

58
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to be six stories right off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the teleprompter.</v>

59
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost the capacity to speak and I had </v>

60
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 3>to kind of squeak out a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about,</v>

61
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to you,</v>

62
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 2>to the main anchors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

63
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>That sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uncontrollable.</v>

64
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

65
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>what caused it?</v>

66
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

67
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 3>definitely know I'm some dumb behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my personal life is what caused it.</v>

68
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 3>I had spent a lot of time as a war </v>
<v Speaker 3>reporter at ABC News.</v>

69
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>

70
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 3>the West Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaza six,</v>

71
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>six trips to and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had come home from a long run and I </v>

72
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 3>covered a kind of pre-invasion invasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a insurgency in one's kind of </v>

73
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:14.371
<v Speaker 3>six month run and I came home after that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got depressed and I didn't </v>

74
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:19.051
<v Speaker 3>actually know I was depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was having some obvious symptoms </v>

75
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:19.051
<v Speaker 3>in hindsight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

76
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I was having trouble getting out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like that,</v>

77
00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 3>had a low grade fever all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I did something really smart,</v>

78
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 3>which is I started to self medicate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and ecstasy.</v>

79
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even though I wasn't doing it all </v>

80
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to say it wasn't like that,</v>

81
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever see the wolf of Wall Street </v>

82
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 3>where they're popping ludes that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't me.</v>

83
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wasn't getting high on the air or </v>

84
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 3>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

85
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting,</v>

86
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 3>I was partying in my spare time because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me feel better.</v>

87
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so after I had the panic attack I went </v>

88
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.581
<v Speaker 3>to a doctor who's an expert in panic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started asking me a bunch of </v>

89
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:53.581
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to figure out what,</v>

90
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what had caused the panic attack and one</v>

91
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 3>of the questions was do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do drugs,</v>

92
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

93
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he leaned back in his chair and gave</v>

94
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 3>me a look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's communicated,</v>

95
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the following sentiment.</v>

96
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay asshole mystery solved.</v>

97
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 3>And he just pointed out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 3>you raised the level of adrenaline in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain artificially,</v>

99
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

100
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you make it much more likely to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>panic attack.</v>

101
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>And I at at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at baseline,</v>

102
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm a jittery little dudes so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>

103
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 3>doesn't take much to put me in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone.</v>

104
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 3>We can just offer me coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said no because that even that </v>

105
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 3>will freak me out.</v>

106
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that ecstasy and cocaine was </v>

107
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.271
<v Speaker 2>the combination because ecstasy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they actually give to a </v>

108
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.361
<v Speaker 2>lot of soldiers that have ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's been quite a few tests on </v>

109
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:39.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

110
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually think ecstasy was the </v>

111
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coke,</v>

112
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

113
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.460
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So those are the two drugs I was mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

115
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 2>How often were you doing it?</v>

116
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

117
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 3>there would be months where I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it at all because I would,</v>

118
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I was off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I covered the 2004 presidential campaign</v>

119
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't have a lot of time to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>snorting coke.</v>

120
00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

121
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 3>but when I was home and around my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

122
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a good,</v>

123
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 3>on a busy week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times a week.</v>

125
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

126
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll do you [inaudible] there's a,</v>

127
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a comeback right now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine is experiencing really ever go </v>

128
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

129
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there some sort of cocaine recession</v>

130
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 2>that had to bounce back from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there was really.</v>

131
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm talking totally </v>

132
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.341
<v Speaker 2>ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been out of the game for a long </v>

133
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:28.341
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

134
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:28.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

135
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of boring now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

136
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 2>but it feels to me like it's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perennial favorite.</v>

137
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

138
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it went through a recession,</v>

139
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just my perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy of mine when I was in high</v>

140
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:45.871
<v Speaker 2>school and his cousin was hooked on coke</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I watched while we're in high </v>

141
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.391
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start selling it and he withered </v>

142
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.921
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost like 30 pounds or something like </v>

143
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:51.921
<v Speaker 2>that and just him and his girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hide out in the attic.</v>

144
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 2>They lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an attic apartment.</v>

145
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.100
<v Speaker 2>They would just hide out there and watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV and do coconut oil,</v>

146
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>coke to people and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

147
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 3>fuck that drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that drug's doing.</v>

148
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.771
<v Speaker 3>Like these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like knowing someone who </v>

149
00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 3>had gotten bitten by a vampire become </v>
<v Speaker 3>something different.</v>

150
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my experience is seeing people do </v>

151
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 3>that led me to never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

152
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean it certainly was not like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

153
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

154
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I could see it over the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

155
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredibly addictive drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think you've made the right call.</v>

156
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems a little.</v>

157
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It's got a little too much gravity </v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to it.</v>

158
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

159
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.350
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

160
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 3>you can get hooked and it will bring you</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

161
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 3>There are other drugs you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not recommending drugs,</v>

162
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

163
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 3>the way of my friend Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

164
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 3>my half brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam over there.</v>

165
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Let me get to it.</v>

166
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are other drugs,</v>

167
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 3>drugs you can do that have vastly lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive,</v>

168
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a character,</v>

169
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 3>a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the word I'm looking for here?</v>

170
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics.</v>

171
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

172
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how did you recover?</v>

173
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't actually doing it that long.</v>

174
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I actually never done hard drugs into my</v>
<v Speaker 3>early thirties and when I came home from</v>

175
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 3>the war zones and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what started it.</v>

176
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were freaked out by seeing too much.</v>

177
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:08.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.760
<v Speaker 3>it's actually wasn't ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

179
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was addicted to the adrenaline I was </v>

180
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.481
<v Speaker 3>having was not that I was traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that I was enjoying it too much </v>

181
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 3>and I would come home and the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>would seem gray and boring.</v>

182
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

183
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the problem.</v>

184
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch her locker?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you did it,</v>

185
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did that resonate with you?</v>

186
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 3>It's been a while since I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apps,</v>

187
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

188
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to just be clear that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of a journalist is so </v>

189
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 3>different from the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much more mild than the experience of</v>

190
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an enlisted man or a woman.</v>

191
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.450
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want to compare my experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

192
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 3>to the hurt locker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a observer on the side and I,</v>

193
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even want to compare my </v>

194
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 3>experience to more experienced work </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondence out there.</v>

195
00:07:55.221 --> 00:08:00.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of like guys like Richard </v>
<v Speaker 3>Angle and I'm absolutely just actually </v>

196
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 3>sat down with him the other day for he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to do documentary coming out.</v>

197
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my experiences are much more mild than </v>

198
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.501
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly enough to really get a </v>

199
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:11.501
<v Speaker 3>sense of how thrilling it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an expression,</v>

200
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing more thrilling than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet that misses you.</v>

201
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>And in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily they all missed.</v>

202
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 3>That was not true for some of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

203
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

204
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a real sense of the stakes,</v>

205
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 3>but 80 is exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also thrilling on a,</v>

206
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a idealistic level.</v>

207
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the importance of bearing </v>

208
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 3>witness to the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the tip of the spirit,</v>

209
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:38.801
<v Speaker 3>to what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what our military is doing in our </v>

210
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of that is a heady mix.</v>

211
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 3>So you knew people over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a journalist that got killed?</v>

212
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

213
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Speaker 3>A very good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who actually ultimately set me </v>

214
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 3>up with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy named Bob Woodruff,</v>

215
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>who was the anchor of world news tonight</v>
<v Speaker 3>on ABC News.</v>

216
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 3>He had only been in the chair for about </v>
<v Speaker 3>a month when he was on a trip to Iraq </v>

217
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.870
<v Speaker 3>and he got hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally got his head nearly blown off </v>

218
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 3>when he was in the back when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of an Iraqi tank.</v>

219
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost died.</v>

220
00:09:06.141 --> 00:09:11.141
<v Speaker 3>He was an absolute miracle is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are pictures of him on the </v>

221
00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Internet with basically half ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

222
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.570
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury was brought back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to life is to this day walking miracle </v>

223
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.030
<v Speaker 3>that he's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

224
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and after he recovered,</v>

225
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 3>he then introduced me to the woman I </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

226
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.890
<v Speaker 3>So he's a close friend and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I saw cases like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost friends,</v>

228
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 3>both Iraqi friends and journalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

229
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

230
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the woman I was dating at the time when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

231
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 3>when I was spending a lot of time in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>

232
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.200
<v Speaker 3>she got hit by a tank show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in the hotel Palestine where all the </v>

234
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.811
<v Speaker 3>journalists were staying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was on a balcony in or one of her </v>

<v Speaker 3>colleagues in the balcony below or he </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a direct hit and died.</v>

236
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

237
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 3>she carried him to the hospital and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically got the reverberations and </v>

238
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 3>couldn't hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still can't hear as far as I know.</v>

239
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>When you're a journalist and you're over</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq or in Afghanistan,</v>

240
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:12.741
<v Speaker 2>you're in war and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing is so far removed from the </v>

241
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 2>day to day life that most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

242
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it like trying to relay that to </v>

243
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How difficult is it trying to.</v>

244
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Because I think so many people have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a dramatic television movie slash</v>

245
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.930
<v Speaker 2>view of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of war where they don't,</v>

246
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 2>they don't ever experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would imagine probably 99 percent</v>

247
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.000
<v Speaker 2>of the people that are in this country </v>
<v Speaker 2>will never experience.</v>

248
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's good.</v>

249
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

250
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that you can describe it,</v>

251
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that will really give the full </v>

252
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a absurdities and,</v>

253
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.340
<v Speaker 3>and horrors and long stretches of </v>
<v Speaker 3>boredom punctuated by terror.</v>

254
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

255
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.960
<v Speaker 4>and also this other piece which is taboo</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about,</v>

256
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 4>which is the pleasure and excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then people get fighting wars.</v>

257
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

258
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 4>This is Sebastian younger's thesis as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

259
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:14.861
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comradery is the most intense </v>

260
00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:15.140
<v Speaker 4>comradery they ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

261
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.150
<v Speaker 4>that's something they come back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilian life and are missing it in and </v>

262
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.770
<v Speaker 4>it's part of what's so difficult about </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming back</v>

263
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.920
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you see them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of risk taking behavior among a </v>

264
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.040
<v Speaker 3>vets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

265
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.330
<v Speaker 3>because I know that you're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>another way to get that hit of </v>

266
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

267
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.370
<v Speaker 3>there was a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm blanking on the name,</v>

268
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 3>is a great book written by a much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced war correspondent to me that</v>

269
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.280
<v Speaker 3>he used the phrase war is a drug and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me sums it up,</v>

270
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:51.281
<v Speaker 3>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got hooked on the experience of being </v>

271
00:11:51.281 --> 00:11:55.650
<v Speaker 3>in these really elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heightened situations,</v>

272
00:11:55.651 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 3>cinematic dramatic situations and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would come home and I just,</v>

273
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do to replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this synthetic squirt of </v>

274
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline that you can get from cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to do it for me,</v>

275
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160
<v Speaker 3>obviously had tremendously negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences and so I wouldn't recommend</v>

276
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see why people do this.</v>

277
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 3>So how did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you bounce back?</v>

278
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.420
<v Speaker 3>That was actually the question you asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>me before that I somehow neglected to </v>

279
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the doctor who pointed out that I was</v>

280
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 3>an idiot and doing drugs and it caused a</v>
<v Speaker 3>panic attack.</v>

281
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agreed he didn't think I needed to go </v>

282
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 3>to rehab because it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty short lived.</v>

283
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:43.351
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in my early thirties when I </v>

284
00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:44.761
<v Speaker 3>started on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still in my early thirties when I had a </v>

285
00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:44.761
<v Speaker 3>panic attack and so it was only a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years,</v>

286
00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just have wanting to come see me once or</v>

287
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:51.571
<v Speaker 3>twice a week forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever basically saying it.</v>

288
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 3>He said basically indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I still say it,</v>

289
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 3>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

290
00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good business model,</v>

291
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 3>but not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's been,</v>

292
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 3>well north of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been about 13 years,</v>

293
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:07.111
<v Speaker 3>so I don't see them that often now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a long time I saw him </v>

294
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:08.490
<v Speaker 3>intensively so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

295
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy and I wouldn't have,</v>

296
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't call what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who have had drug </v>

297
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 3>addictions that are vastly more severe </v>
<v Speaker 3>than mine.</v>

298
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

299
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>it sucks to stop a habit that is giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pleasure on,</v>

300
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>

301
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.960
<v Speaker 3>pretty prominent areas of your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're</v>

302
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.130
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're talking about is very,</v>

303
00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:33.780
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very extreme situation.</v>

304
00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:36.000
<v Speaker 5>Like being a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a war correspondent,</v>

305
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:41.001
<v Speaker 5>going over there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>experiencing that intense sort of </v>

306
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:42.510
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline rush and then having your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your issues with it.</v>

307
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:48.170
<v Speaker 5>But it seems like there's a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of people today that are </v>

308
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.430
<v Speaker 5>stimulating themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adderall.</v>

309
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.280
<v Speaker 5>It was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just A.</v>

310
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've found out recently like four or </v>

311
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.511
<v Speaker 5>five people that I didn't know that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>on adderall and it seems like you just </v>

312
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:02.010
<v Speaker 5>sort of start asking questions and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out how many people.</v>

313
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:07.011
<v Speaker 5>I mean all these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my kid goes to school with a bunch of </v>

314
00:14:07.011 --> 00:14:11.181
<v Speaker 5>other kids and you get to meet the </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents and like fucking half of them </v>

315
00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:11.520
<v Speaker 5>were on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very weird.</v>

316
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.300
<v Speaker 5>And adderall is a form of amphetamine </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it seems like,</v>

317
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

318
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.190
<v Speaker 5>it's mind boggling how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing this stuff.</v>

319
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.380
<v Speaker 3>We're dosing ourselves with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things so it can be stimulated </v>

320
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 3>stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also can be a Benzos,</v>

321
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cousins of Valium.</v>

322
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be shopping,</v>

323
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.330
<v Speaker 3>gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be a,</v>

324
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.540
<v Speaker 3>a whatever except the twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

325
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just speaking,</v>

326
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 3>we have a neuroscientist in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll let him say more about this.</v>

327
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:49.300
<v Speaker 3>And also a guy who's more experienced </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner of Buddhism that I am.</v>

328
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

329
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does speak to the nature of the</v>

330
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Speaker 2>human mind that we're always on the hunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next little hit of dopamine and </v>

331
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 2>now there are lots of ways to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

332
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>it's also very bizarre that you can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

333
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's ever been a time </v>

334
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.711
<v Speaker 2>in history where you could just take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill and you'll be elevated for five or </v>

335
00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:13.181
<v Speaker 2>six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that your doctor will give you </v>

336
00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>this pill and they'll encourage you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it and then you'll find out that 50</v>

337
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people in your community </v>
<v Speaker 2>and take it.</v>

338
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done stories about parents who </v>

339
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.370
<v Speaker 2>steal it from the kids.</v>

340
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Also just caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>

341
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:23.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reaching for the coffee here,</v>

342
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.660
<v Speaker 4>having slept poorly last night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that is,</v>

343
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.970
<v Speaker 4>and that's just as much of a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not as.</v>

344
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not as potent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The drug is taken methamphetamine or,</v>

345
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.690
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or adderall or anything else that's a </v>

346
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:39.690
<v Speaker 4>drug drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

347
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean as a whole,</v>

348
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this had civilizational consequences </v>

349
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when humanity,</v>

350
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.580
<v Speaker 4>more or less switched from alcohol in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning to caffeine in the morning,</v>

351
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.940
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things got a lot different than we used </v>

352
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:53.940
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for hundreds of years.</v>

353
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.230
<v Speaker 4>People were just drinking ale and wine </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning,</v>

354
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

355
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.000
<v Speaker 4>before coffee and tea became huge in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>

356
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

357
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 4>it kind of colonialism the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

358
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:08.650
<v Speaker 4>the engine of colonialism to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant degree was coffee,</v>

359
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Speaker 4>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>

360
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

361
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.990
<v Speaker 4>things are behavior changed.</v>

362
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.270
<v Speaker 2>So people that were drinking ale and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wine weren't,</v>

363
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.330
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they drank it with food </v>

364
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.330
<v Speaker 2>is because the water would get stagnant.</v>

365
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's the issue with clean water </v>

366
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

367
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>

368
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 4>if just imagine the consequences of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone,</v>

369
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting up in the morning and just </v>

370
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 4>starting with beer or wine</v>

371
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.070
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

372
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 4>long day or a very short one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.510
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

374
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.590
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

375
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:47.310
<v Speaker 4>But the fundamental point of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying neuroscience is that all of </v>

376
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 4>these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything you're putting into your body,</v>

377
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:54.340
<v Speaker 4>it is modifying the behavior of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

378
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:59.370
<v Speaker 4>is only modifying the existing available</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry of your brain.</v>

379
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:04.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean the these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these molecules either gets your brain </v>

380
00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:08.791
<v Speaker 4>to secrete more of an existing </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitter or they mimic an </v>

381
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:12.961
<v Speaker 4>existing neurotransmitter binding to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same receptor site where they keep </v>

382
00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 4>something in play longer than it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise have been,</v>

383
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:18.910
<v Speaker 4>that they block the uptake of of </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.</v>

384
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 4>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a drug is never get in your brain</v>

385
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.640
<v Speaker 4>to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain is incapable of doing so.</v>

386
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.300
<v Speaker 4>And that's the most extreme thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dmt or Lsd in the brain.</v>

387
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:36.330
<v Speaker 4>The brain is still doing all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it stands to reason that there </v>

388
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.730
<v Speaker 4>are potentially other ways of getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain to do that.</v>

389
00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:44.731
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's meditation or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer interface ultimately to the </v>

390
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:49.351
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are interested in in brain </v>

391
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:52.471
<v Speaker 4>computer interface that not only allows </v>
<v Speaker 4>a quadriplegic to move a robotic arm or </v>

392
00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:00.290
<v Speaker 4>gets a a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Parkinson's patient to be able to </v>

393
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

394
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the ultimate degree,</v>

395
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:07.311
<v Speaker 4>I mean actually augmenting human </v>
<v Speaker 4>function that's a or opening landscapes </v>

396
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 4>of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic and otherwise that have been</v>

397
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 4>unexplored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

398
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that is</v>

399
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

400
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.480
<v Speaker 4>in principle possible because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just talking about electro </v>

401
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.490
<v Speaker 4>chemical phenomenon happening in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>heads which are being,</v>

402
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.810
<v Speaker 4>which is just there to be</v>

403
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Speaker 2>modulator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you were talking about being </v>

404
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.671
<v Speaker 2>depressed and Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about re uptake </v>

405
00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what are your,</v>

406
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.710
<v Speaker 2>what are your thoughts on the massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people there are on Ssri is </v>

407
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.880
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is another thing that I know</v>

408
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.120
<v Speaker 2>how many people I know that I'm either </v>
<v Speaker 2>on or have been on some sort of </v>

409
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.210
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants and it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to the layman,</v>

410
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.250
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone who's never taken them or </v>

411
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have personal experience with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>massively overprescribed.</v>

412
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well anything I say is with the caveat </v>

413
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 4>that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

414
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a neurologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have.</v>

415
00:19:03.861 --> 00:19:08.861
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have zero clinical experience and I'm </v>

416
00:19:08.861 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 4>certainly not my area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not up on the recent literature on </v>

417
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.750
<v Speaker 4>the efficacy of antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is clearly,</v>

418
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a spectrum.</v>

419
00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:26.771
<v Speaker 4>There are people who have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>unambiguously helped by antidepressants </v>

420
00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:27.980
<v Speaker 4>and there are people who are on them who</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be on them,</v>

421
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there are people who are on them who</v>

422
00:19:30.321 --> 00:19:33.500
<v Speaker 4>wants to get off them and find it </v>
<v Speaker 4>surprisingly difficult to get off them.</v>

423
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.600
<v Speaker 4>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

424
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are blunt instruments by by </v>

425
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.651
<v Speaker 4>definition because it's anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>modulating serotonin in this case is </v>

426
00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:51.320
<v Speaker 4>effective everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin is effective and it's just,</v>

427
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 4>there's no magical property of</v>

428
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.790
<v Speaker 6>have a</v>

429
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.470
<v Speaker 4>finding the neuromodulator where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where only the symptoms you want to </v>

430
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.520
<v Speaker 4>relieve our effect because these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

431
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.070
<v Speaker 4>these chemicals do a lot of things and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of places and even in your gut,</v>

432
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:15.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not said that hence the side </v>

433
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.130
<v Speaker 4>effects you get with almost any </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>

434
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120
<v Speaker 4>And we would have to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be in many respects as a matter</v>

435
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:25.121
<v Speaker 4>of luck to find a pharmacological target</v>
<v Speaker 4>that actually does just what you want it</v>

436
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:29.140
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it just to say that,</v>

437
00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:34.141
<v Speaker 4>that those receptors are not elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are going to reduce side effects </v>

438
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:34.141
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

439
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

440
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.630
<v Speaker 4>that's why a different kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>intervention,</v>

441
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:43.631
<v Speaker 4>something like ultimately some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some electrical or magnetic or,</v>

442
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 4>or a machine based could be more </v>
<v Speaker 4>targeted because then you're,</v>

443
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 4>you're not just putting something in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bloodstream that spreads everywhere.</v>

444
00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Machine based.</v>

445
00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:01.521
<v Speaker 2>You mean something like electrodes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they put on the mind to or the surface </v>

446
00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:01.860
<v Speaker 2>of the head to stimulate areas of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

447
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

448
00:21:02.811 --> 00:21:07.811
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we have now is also still pretty </v>

449
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:10.841
<v Speaker 4>primitive and anything that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have that would be super futuristic </v>

450
00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:16.691
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't seem to require that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put something actually inside your </v>

451
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:17.390
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

452
00:21:17.391 --> 00:21:22.391
<v Speaker 4>So whether that's a neurosurgery or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting something into the bloodstream </v>

453
00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:27.730
<v Speaker 4>that somehow gets inside your head what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is an injectable,</v>

454
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

455
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elon Musk just mentioned something </v>

456
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 4>called a which he called neural lace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

457
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.530
<v Speaker 4>believe a term that came from a Scifi </v>
<v Speaker 4>novel.</v>

458
00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:42.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it originates with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big science fiction reader,</v>

459
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 4>but he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

460
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.500
<v Speaker 4>he announced an investment in a company </v>
<v Speaker 4>called neuro neuro link,</v>

461
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 4>which is looking at looking at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced brain computer interface,</v>

462
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on the idea that you could get a </v>

463
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.530
<v Speaker 4>way with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these new micro electrodes,</v>

464
00:22:00.531 --> 00:22:05.531
<v Speaker 4>you can get an injectable Mesh like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a wire mesh that just integrates </v>

465
00:22:06.771 --> 00:22:11.240
<v Speaker 4>with the brain or very likely just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cortex.</v>

466
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I believe this work has already been</v>

467
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 4>done in mice and the mice are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

468
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.010
<v Speaker 4>have survived and are living with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this mesh in there in their brains.</v>

469
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.510
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not research.</v>

470
00:22:23.511 --> 00:22:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm close to it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in and he just announced it a couple</v>

471
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:27.200
<v Speaker 4>of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

472
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:29.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in principle,</v>

473
00:22:29.421 --> 00:22:29.910
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

474
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.160
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about having a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a mesh or whether it's,</v>

475
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a bag neato electric particles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something that is on site around </v>

476
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 4>individual neurons or assemblages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurons which can both read out and </v>

477
00:22:46.881 --> 00:22:50.630
<v Speaker 4>input wirelessly signal from those </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurons.</v>

478
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.830
<v Speaker 4>So just both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

479
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.340
<v Speaker 4>putting your thoughts into the world by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

480
00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 4>influencing effectors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a robotic arms or cursors on screens or </v>

481
00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:06.521
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also influencing your mind based on </v>

482
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:07.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever</v>

483
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 2>puts you want to put in there from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

484
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:11.760
<v Speaker 2>whether that's Doug mentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hack you and yeah,</v>

485
00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that opens,</v>

486
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it opens all of those concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

487
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always the Russians,</v>

488
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Chinese gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Chinese people are </v>

489
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.760
<v Speaker 2>responsible for a lot of the propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes us think about the Russians.</v>

490
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Just push it off on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push it off on them.</v>

491
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm prepared to blame the Russians for a</v>

492
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:29.220
<v Speaker 2>lot at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blame a law.</v>

493
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 2>What a slippery slope though for humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming cyborgs.</v>

494
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're already like some weird form of </v>

495
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.830
<v Speaker 2>semi hot right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karen,</v>

496
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.260
<v Speaker 2>our cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a baby,</v>

497
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you leave your cell phone or home </v>

498
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:43.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

499
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I forgot the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a very strange thing that we</v>

500
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.511
<v Speaker 2>already have and there's not a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of steps between that and snapchat </v>

501
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 2>glasses.</v>

502
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's got the snapchat glasses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing those things I didn't know they </v>

503
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.240
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other very strange they are.</v>

504
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They have little cameras on them and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to go ahead,</v>

505
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.980
<v Speaker 2>throw them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

506
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.660
<v Speaker 2>But now he knows how to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google glass just was totally still born</v>

507
00:24:03.661 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't.</v>

508
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>

509
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:05.850
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

510
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 2>he's transmitting or he's making a video</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with that left side.</v>

511
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:12.950
<v Speaker 2>See how the left side of spinning with </v>
<v Speaker 2>snapchat do like 15 seconds,</v>

512
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.080
<v Speaker 2>10 seconds at 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little counter.</v>

513
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:20.081
<v Speaker 2>It's just flashing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like the last three seconds and you </v>

514
00:24:20.081 --> 00:24:22.061
<v Speaker 2>can hit it again and do another 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds so you can hold it and do like </v>

515
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.061
<v Speaker 2>30 seconds or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

516
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Step one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that spinning just to alert the </v>

517
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:26.910
<v Speaker 4>people you're looking at that</v>

518
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 2>to sort of alert me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to let me know that my recording is </v>

519
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.731
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably a little bit to let you know </v>

520
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:36.201
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's probably the only </v>

521
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:37.701
<v Speaker 2>notification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that I'm recording and it just </v>

522
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't post automatically and now I </v>

523
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>have to link it to my phone and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>post it from there.</v>

524
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Google glass thing made people very </v>

525
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:44.620
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

526
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I tried to very early prototype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good friend of mine who was a </v>

527
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 2>executive at Google at the time and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>got ahold of one of the really early </v>

528
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 2>ones that actually had to be tethered by</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cord and you know,</v>

529
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you talk to it and swipe it and I played</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it a couple of times and we used it</v>

530
00:24:58.171 --> 00:25:03.171
<v Speaker 2>once at a ufc way in where I put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I broadcast from the way and it's </v>

531
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:03.330
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very odd.</v>

532
00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 2>But it made people made people very </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

533
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you could see the difference when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw you with that thing on all of a</v>

534
00:25:08.731 --> 00:25:12.180
<v Speaker 2>sudden there was all this apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're being recorded,</v>

535
00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:15.510
<v Speaker 2>are transmitted or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how long?</v>

536
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.000
<v Speaker 2>How long do we have where we're still </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

537
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long before you asked that question?</v>

538
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.850
<v Speaker 4>Our sense of private.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

539
00:25:27.851 --> 00:25:32.851
<v Speaker 4>I remember what it was like to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotic about the sound of your voice </v>

540
00:25:32.851 --> 00:25:34.870
<v Speaker 4>on a voicemail or Laura on the answering</v>
<v Speaker 4>machine,</v>

541
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like rerecording the outgoing message </v>

542
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.661
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just just being worried about your </v>

543
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:42.661
<v Speaker 4>voice showing up and someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 4>tape.</v>

544
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now we were living in this pan optic</v>

545
00:25:45.851 --> 00:25:50.851
<v Speaker 4>on surveillance society where you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>assume you're on camera virtually every </v>

546
00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:55.051
<v Speaker 4>moment or in public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I guess people don't think </v>

547
00:25:55.051 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 4>about it all that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

548
00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.660
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think we're the norms around </v>

549
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 4>privacy shift just because we get so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much value from having the data </v>

550
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:05.980
<v Speaker 4>ultimately</v>

551
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems also like to just this</v>

552
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.060
<v Speaker 2>inexorable pole towards this connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have it.</v>

553
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take where we are now and sort of</v>

554
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>look at all the data points and </v>
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate,</v>

555
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look good,</v>

556
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 4>it just salt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's both.</v>

557
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 4>It's both bad and good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fake news thing is horrible,</v>

558
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.630
<v Speaker 4>but the ability to fact check in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to pick up your phone and </v>

559
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 4>find out what's true is has also never </v>
<v Speaker 4>been better,</v>

560
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:44.530
<v Speaker 4>so it's like we're both vulnerable in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that we've never been and where </v>

561
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:44.530
<v Speaker 4>we're empowered</v>

562
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 2>in a way that we've always been true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but technological progress.</v>

563
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there's a certain </v>

564
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.491
<v Speaker 2>amount of time we have left before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>give birth to some new thing we're </v>

565
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:58.330
<v Speaker 2>talking about just integrating ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically with,</v>

566
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 2>with our machines and also something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's independent of us,</v>

567
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 2>some artificial intelligence independent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

568
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.130
<v Speaker 2>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to look for some fear around </v>

569
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got the right guy,</v>

570
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Well we've talked about Evan's past </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fears here.</v>

572
00:27:10.781 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean Josh has apps freaked me out this</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

574
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>sent me some articles about the self </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving trucks that are already going in</v>

575
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:24.051
<v Speaker 2>Australia that are as big as a seven 67 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're driving down the road by </v>

576
00:27:24.051 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 2>themselves with cargo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably nuclear waste or something.</v>

577
00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to wind down the road,</v>

578
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.130
<v Speaker 2>but people are so bad at it.</v>

579
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Driving that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

580
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the robots just have to get reliably </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than people and then you'll just </v>

581
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.410
<v Speaker 4>feel nothing but relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably already are yet.</v>

582
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

583
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they probably are,</v>

584
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.380
<v Speaker 4>as far as I know from what I hear from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tesla that yeah,</v>

585
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:50.180
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the accident,</v>

586
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.370
<v Speaker 4>the man hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have people using the autopilot in </v>

587
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.370
<v Speaker 4>the autopilots not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

588
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Obviously two people have died already </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

589
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.050
<v Speaker 4>from using it badly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still they have something like some </v>

590
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:07.710
<v Speaker 4>millions of man hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have autopilot assisted driving and </v>

591
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 4>I think that is has been safer than just</v>
<v Speaker 4>pure ape.</v>

592
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the video of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell asleep in traffic in San Francisco?</v>

593
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.910
<v Speaker 2>He's literally out cold and his car is </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving on the highway kind of fit.</v>

594
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just some guy on his way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

595
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.330
<v Speaker 2>just pass out completely mouth open and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are filming them.</v>

596
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.170
<v Speaker 2>His cars driving down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually probably the people filming him</v>

597
00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:32.450
<v Speaker 2>or doing the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more dangerous thing.</v>

598
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.240
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Well texting and driving drive me crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see it.</v>

600
00:28:36.831 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Like to be in an uber now you can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

601
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Speaker 2>you can see how many people are texting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

602
00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Including your driver sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

603
00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 2>That drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

604
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Here's the guy that dude's Alcoa is cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>creeping along and stop and go traffic </v>

605
00:28:52.821 --> 00:28:55.400
<v Speaker 2>and he is completely alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

606
00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Well it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The autopilot works.</v>

607
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

608
00:29:00.831 --> 00:29:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

609
00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Texting and driving scares the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

610
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:09.130
<v Speaker 2>That pokemon go thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God that that died off but </v>

611
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.740
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving on the highway and there </v>

612
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:12.860
<v Speaker 2>was a woman to the left of us and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed that she was being,</v>

613
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.750
<v Speaker 2>her face was illuminated by her cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

614
00:29:14.751 --> 00:29:17.750
<v Speaker 2>So I look over and she's playing pokemon</v>
<v Speaker 2>as she's driving.</v>

615
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.210
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I don't know how pokemon </v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

616
00:29:20.211 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but I guess you pick up things and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driving you get stuff.</v>

617
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.150
<v Speaker 2>And so she was playing the game while </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on the hot,</v>

618
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.520
<v Speaker 2>barely paying attention to the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking at her phone.</v>

619
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.640
<v Speaker 2>This is the argument for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for robot drivers.</v>

620
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

621
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 2>And also it will open up and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are ultimately being driven safely,</v>

622
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 4>buy a car that you trust more than you </v>
<v Speaker 4>trust yourself.</v>

623
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 4>Then just imagine the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

624
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.740
<v Speaker 4>the information consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment options that open up </v>

625
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:52.740
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll watch movies,</v>

626
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.460
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

627
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:58.530
<v Speaker 4>you'll listen to podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get work done and it will become </v>

628
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.951
<v Speaker 4>a space of more not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna miss having to pay </v>

629
00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 4>attention to the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

630
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 4>maybe maybe there's some people want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive recreationally for some reason,</v>

631
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

632
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 4>it will just be a new space where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't believe that 40,000</v>

633
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:17.260
<v Speaker 4>people every year were dying because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't figure out how to drive safely.</v>

634
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that a slippery slope like </v>
<v Speaker 4>$40,000?</v>

635
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a great thing that 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not going to die.</v>

636
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that we're going gonna stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>people from driving a car,</v>

637
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have to live with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>40,000</v>

638
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I was going to say,</v>

639
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but I was gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean pretty much all the things that </v>

640
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:35.850
<v Speaker 4>people do.</v>

641
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 4>And then it's going to get down to why </v>
<v Speaker 4>have people mean ultimately that's the.</v>

642
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 4>When I look at the event horizon of </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence,</v>

643
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:44.700
<v Speaker 4>it's why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would we were so far?</v>

644
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.980
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to get our shit together</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the time artificial intelligence is </v>

645
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.430
<v Speaker 4>given birth to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While that that all goes to what we </v>

646
00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 4>build,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we build artificial intelligence that is</v>

647
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 4>independent of us and seems conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>and is more powerful than us.</v>

648
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Well then we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have built a in limit.</v>

649
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:14.461
<v Speaker 4>We have essentially built a god that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>now have to be in relationship to and </v>

650
00:31:14.461 --> 00:31:18.391
<v Speaker 4>hopefully that works out well for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very easy to see how it might </v>

651
00:31:18.391 --> 00:31:23.251
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're even scarier cases in </v>

652
00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 4>that that we could build something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has like power,</v>

653
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 4>but there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's conscious.</v>

654
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

655
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 4>it's no more conscious than our current </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers,</v>

656
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.370
<v Speaker 4>which is to say that intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness may be separable </v>

657
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon that you could.</v>

658
00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Intelligence can scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but consciousness need not come along </v>

659
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.941
<v Speaker 4>for the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that for me is the worst case </v>

660
00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 4>scenario because we inherit all of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger of,</v>

661
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:47.980
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>

662
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.130
<v Speaker 4>the power of this system being </v>
<v Speaker 4>misaligned with our interest.</v>

663
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 4>We could build something that is godlike</v>
<v Speaker 4>in its power.</v>

664
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.190
<v Speaker 4>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

665
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:02.090
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could essentially be canceling the </v>

666
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.291
<v Speaker 4>prospects of the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness because of this thing </v>

667
00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 4>wipes us out that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

668
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Nick Bostrom,</v>

669
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 4>the philosopher who wrote a great book </v>
<v Speaker 4>on this entitled Superintelligence,</v>

670
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.580
<v Speaker 4>I think he calls this the Disneyland </v>
<v Speaker 4>without children and were like,</v>

671
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically we could build this,</v>

672
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.950
<v Speaker 4>this incredibly powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent landscape that continues to </v>

673
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.850
<v Speaker 4>refine itself and its own powers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

674
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 4>who knows what ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ways perhaps that are,</v>

675
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.170
<v Speaker 4>that are unimaginable to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet they're,</v>

676
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.350
<v Speaker 4>the lights aren't on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

677
00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

678
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.870
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing that is like to be this </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine or system of machines is in the </v>

679
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 4>way that is probably nothing that has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be the internet right now.</v>

680
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 4>You think of all this going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Internet.</v>

681
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

682
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the Internet is conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>of any of it right now.</v>

683
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 4>The question is could the internet </v>
<v Speaker 4>become conscious of what its thinking </v>

684
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:57.100
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's no reason to think it </v>

685
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just we don't understand the,</v>

686
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 4>the physical basis of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet the real question is why would it do</v>

687
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:07.031
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it doesn't have any of the </v>

688
00:33:07.031 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 4>biological motivations that people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to breed and to stay alive and to,</v>

689
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight or flight and to be nervous and </v>

690
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.980
<v Speaker 4>this desire to carry on our genes mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really did build the ultimate </v>

691
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.720
<v Speaker 4>supercomputer artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was beyond our capacity for reason </v>

692
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 4>and understanding what niches do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing because everything is pointless.</v>

693
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

694
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 4>because what we would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would program it,</v>

695
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 4>it would do whatever we asked it to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>initially,</v>

696
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

697
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 4>We things we program now have goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

698
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:37.241
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your thermostat is trying to regulate </v>

699
00:33:37.241 --> 00:33:37.241
<v Speaker 4>the temperature in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

700
00:33:37.241 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 4>and when get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it gets too warm,</v>

701
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:41.000
<v Speaker 4>it kicks on the air and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it gets too cold,</v>

702
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:41.930
<v Speaker 4>it kicks on the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

703
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 4>that's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a goal,</v>

704
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

705
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 4>so we would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are everything we build.</v>

706
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 4>That's automated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has goals explicitly programmed into it,</v>

707
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.170
<v Speaker 4>and when you're talking about a truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent machine,</v>

708
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.950
<v Speaker 4>it will have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will discover a goals that you have </v>

709
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.861
<v Speaker 4>never programmed into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are our intermediate to the goal </v>

710
00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 4>that you have programs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

711
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.900
<v Speaker 4>if the goal of this machine is to pick </v>
<v Speaker 4>up all the trash in this room and you </v>

712
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.240
<v Speaker 4>physically try to stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then it's gonna try to get around </v>

713
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 4>you to pick up the rest of the trash and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the room.</v>

714
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

715
00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:21.530
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

716
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 4>this probably already true of a Roomba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

717
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.300
<v Speaker 4>I actually don't have a room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

718
00:34:25.301 --> 00:34:30.301
<v Speaker 4>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you put something in the way of the </v>

719
00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:33.011
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to get around the thing </v>

720
00:34:33.011 --> 00:34:33.011
<v Speaker 4>you have put in it's way so that it can </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to the rest of the room.</v>

721
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.500
<v Speaker 4>So that's an intermediate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of these goals need never have </v>

722
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 4>been explicitly thought about or </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented,</v>

723
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.620
<v Speaker 4>which is to say programmed into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet they,</v>

724
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.210
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're formed by,</v>

725
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 4>by the fact that the thing has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>longterm goal.</v>

726
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 4>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the concerns is that we could </v>

727
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 4>build something that has a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal,</v>

728
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 4>build something that's super powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has a longterm goal,</v>

729
00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:01.280
<v Speaker 4>which in principle is benign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

730
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.020
<v Speaker 4>As executive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something we want,</v>

731
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.680
<v Speaker 4>and yet it could discover instrumental </v>
<v Speaker 4>goals that are deeply hostile to what we</v>

732
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

733
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing doesn't have common sense,</v>

734
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:16.961
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't figured out how to build </v>

735
00:35:16.961 --> 00:35:18.881
<v Speaker 4>common sense into the machine so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cartoon examples of this kind of </v>

736
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:24.011
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one example that Ilan used when he </v>

737
00:35:24.011 --> 00:35:25.670
<v Speaker 4>first was expressing fears about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you built a machine,</v>

738
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 4>the only goal of which was was to cancel</v>
<v Speaker 4>spam,</v>

739
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:29.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more.</v>

740
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 4>We don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we want.</v>

741
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 4>No more spam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of the spam.</v>

742
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an easy way to get rid of spam is just </v>

743
00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 4>killed all the people right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy thing to think,</v>

744
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's not in unless you've built,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you've closed the door to that </v>

745
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 4>intermediate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to think that a</v>

746
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.200
<v Speaker 5>for powerful machine couldn't form such </v>
<v Speaker 5>a goal.</v>

747
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 5>My question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if this super powerful machine has the </v>

748
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:55.870
<v Speaker 5>ability to create new super powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>machines,</v>

749
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.700
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't use the same mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would it,</v>

750
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.330
<v Speaker 5>would it still try to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 5>original programming or would it realize</v>

751
00:36:01.331 --> 00:36:06.100
<v Speaker 5>that our original program is only </v>
<v Speaker 5>instrumental to the success of the human</v>

752
00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:10.330
<v Speaker 5>race and it might think the human race </v>
<v Speaker 5>is ridiculous and preposterous and why?</v>

753
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Why not just program something that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks is the ultimate intelligence?</v>

754
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.680
<v Speaker 5>Something beyond our capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasoning and understanding now and that</v>

755
00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:25.681
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would wonder in the absence of any </v>

756
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:27.550
<v Speaker 5>sort of biological motivations and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>absence would mean.</v>

757
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Do you think of all the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

758
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you break it down to what motivates </v>

759
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.140
<v Speaker 5>people to get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What motivates people to do good,</v>

760
00:36:35.141 --> 00:36:40.141
<v Speaker 5>but my sense of community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a desire to breed the social status,</v>

761
00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:42.370
<v Speaker 5>all these different things that motivate</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to do things.</v>

762
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.670
<v Speaker 5>We remove all of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what actions would it take?</v>

763
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

764
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I think you want to build it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is focused on our wellbeing.</v>

765
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.850
<v Speaker 4>And so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Stuart Russell on my podcast,</v>

766
00:36:57.851 --> 00:37:01.570
<v Speaker 4>he's a computer scientist at Berkeley </v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

767
00:37:01.571 --> 00:37:06.571
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike many computer scientists takes </v>

768
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:07.840
<v Speaker 4>this problem really seriously and has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought a lot about it.</v>

769
00:37:07.841 --> 00:37:12.841
<v Speaker 4>And in his lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe they're working on a,</v>

770
00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 4>a way of thinking about safety that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is open ended and flexible without,</v>

771
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.640
<v Speaker 4>without pretending we have any of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right answers in the near term or,</v>

772
00:37:25.641 --> 00:37:30.641
<v Speaker 4>or likely to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you want to build a system that wants</v>

773
00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:34.330
<v Speaker 4>to know what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right at each point.</v>

774
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's tracking what humanity one </v>

775
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.840
<v Speaker 4>wants in terms of its goals and wants to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stay aligned with whatever it is we </v>

776
00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

777
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.400
<v Speaker 4>wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to learn from what we seem to want</v>

778
00:37:48.401 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 4>based on our behavior.</v>

779
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

780
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.890
<v Speaker 4>and so there could be some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>clarifying function.</v>

781
00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Where were we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

782
00:37:55.751 --> 00:38:00.751
<v Speaker 4>we can get our priorities more aligned </v>
<v Speaker 4>in dialogue with the super intelligent </v>

783
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:04.891
<v Speaker 4>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is it always wants </v>

784
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:09.211
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't think it knows what we want </v>

785
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:12.720
<v Speaker 4>and it continually wants to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>approximating better and better what we </v>

786
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.920
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so from my point of view,</v>

787
00:38:14.921 --> 00:38:19.921
<v Speaker 4>the most crucial thing is you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always want the door to remain open </v>

788
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.620
<v Speaker 4>to the statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

789
00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:23.980
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

790
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.810
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

791
00:38:25.811 --> 00:38:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Like you wouldn't want to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>presence of this.</v>

792
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:32.490
<v Speaker 4>God likes super power that will always </v>
<v Speaker 4>take direction from you when say,</v>

793
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

794
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's</v>

795
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.990
<v Speaker 5>not going in the right direction and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

796
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.690
<v Speaker 5>So the fear is we could build something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>

797
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 5>is just not amenable to being controlled</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that way.</v>

798
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Is it not the case that computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are starting to come around </v>

799
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:50.740
<v Speaker 3>to the idea that there's real danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

800
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 3>potentially there's dangerous potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

801
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:54.530
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Ai.</v>

802
00:38:54.531 --> 00:38:59.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to when you talked to </v>

803
00:38:59.531 --> 00:38:59.531
<v Speaker 3>will macaskill a few weeks ago who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

804
00:38:59.531 --> 00:38:59.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

805
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:01.820
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a few years from starting to</v>

806
00:39:01.821 --> 00:39:04.880
<v Speaker 3>think about how to split the atom to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually having a bomb.</v>

807
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they not coming around the idea that</v>

808
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.960
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that technology can progress much faster</v>

809
00:39:11.961 --> 00:39:13.130
<v Speaker 3>than we think of?</v>

810
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

811
00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:19.151
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole spectrum of the people who </v>

812
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.951
<v Speaker 5>think that this is never going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it's so far away that thinking about </v>

813
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:25.601
<v Speaker 5>it now is completely irrational to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are super worried and think </v>

814
00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:29.360
<v Speaker 5>that huge changes are imminent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's just the spectrum.</v>

815
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm with the ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

816
00:39:31.161 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's as am I,</v>

817
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.630
<v Speaker 5>what my concern is not even with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>initial construction,</v>

818
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.470
<v Speaker 5>like the initial ai,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my concern is with what the ai creates.</v>

819
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 5>If we give the AI ability to improve </v>
<v Speaker 5>upon itself and look at are irrational </v>

820
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:48.080
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and how we've programmed itself</v>
<v Speaker 5>to support the human race.</v>

821
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.340
<v Speaker 5>And then it might go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

822
00:39:49.341 --> 00:39:52.160
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys are ridiculous.</v>

823
00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

824
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.680
<v Speaker 5>this is a new life form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new.</v>

825
00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.780
<v Speaker 5>We've given birth to some incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>potent new thing that we think of it as </v>

826
00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:01.310
<v Speaker 5>artificial by.</v>

827
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it really,</v>

828
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.290
<v Speaker 5>it's just a form of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a form of life that we've created.</v>

829
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 5>Human beings have sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the analogy I always use is that we're </v>

830
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.731
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an electronic caterpillar </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving birth to some spectacular </v>

831
00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:18.590
<v Speaker 5>butterfly we're not even aware of while </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're building our cocoon.</v>

832
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 5>We're just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a caterpillar fully </v>

833
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 5>conscious of what it's doing when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes that cocoon,</v>

834
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 5>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it just does and there's plenty of </v>

835
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 5>examples of that in nature of something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's doing something that's going </v>

836
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.660
<v Speaker 5>through some metamorphosis that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely unconscious.</v>

837
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.290
<v Speaker 5>My worry would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's not even really a worry.</v>

838
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 5>It's more like looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility of the AI improving upon </v>

839
00:40:41.721 --> 00:40:46.721
<v Speaker 5>itself and making a far better version </v>
<v Speaker 5>than we could create like almost </v>

840
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:47.390
<v Speaker 5>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

841
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:52.670
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that if you give it the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be autonomous and you give it the </v>

842
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.631
<v Speaker 5>ability to innovate and to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out what's a better way around things </v>

843
00:40:55.631 --> 00:41:00.461
<v Speaker 5>and what's a better way to program </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and then make its own version of </v>

844
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:00.461
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

845
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.720
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really will be just.</v>

846
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's obviously just talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really would be a god.</v>

847
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about something that if </v>

848
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:11.570
<v Speaker 5>we give it the ability to create,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we give it the ability to think,</v>

849
00:41:11.571 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rationalize,</v>

850
00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:16.040
<v Speaker 5>and then build,</v>
<v Speaker 5>build something better.</v>

851
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:21.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean by bill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be thinking more software </v>

852
00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:25.391
<v Speaker 5>than hardware to make it there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's obviously there's anything is </v>

853
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:28.361
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that can be built with </v>

854
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:28.361
<v Speaker 5>intelligence can be built with </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence,</v>

855
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:31.520
<v Speaker 5>so you could be talking about armies of </v>
<v Speaker 5>robots and nanotechnology and everything</v>

856
00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:32.120
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

857
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 5>That is the staple</v>

858
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.490
<v Speaker 4>of the PSI Phi scare scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm more likely and certainly faster</v>

859
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:46.150
<v Speaker 4>and ultimately more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about something that can </v>

860
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 4>rewrite it's own code,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve.</v>

861
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:47.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

862
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.310
<v Speaker 4>it's the code that is that is dictating </v>
<v Speaker 4>the intelligence and so you're talking </v>

863
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 4>about something that could be for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>longest time,</v>

864
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 4>invisible and just happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

865
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about code that could,</v>

866
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 4>could be put into financial markets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

867
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Which could be built to be self </v>
<v Speaker 4>modifying.</v>

868
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's already out in the wild.</v>

869
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:17.891
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not sequestered in some air gapped </v>

870
00:42:17.891 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 4>computer in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's out there and it's changing itself.</v>

871
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be totally irresponsible </v>

872
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:25.900
<v Speaker 4>thing to do from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a,</v>

873
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a software designers point of view,</v>

874
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 4>I think at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

875
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.640
<v Speaker 4>there's just no question that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get to a place where I'm going.</v>

876
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.740
<v Speaker 4>It's either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either it will be the province of one </v>

877
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 4>lab that gets there first or it will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>open source,</v>

878
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:48.041
<v Speaker 4>but you're talking about software rev,</v>
<v Speaker 4>US figuring out how to write better.</v>

879
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:53.471
<v Speaker 4>It's better software which becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis of general intelligence and then </v>

880
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 4>where that gets put and what gets done </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>

881
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:03.911
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the question isn't in the real </v>

882
00:43:03.911 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 4>question of also the race to see who can</v>
<v Speaker 4>come up with one first.</v>

883
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once the idea gets put out there,</v>

884
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.750
<v Speaker 4>like the idea of the nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously no one in their right </v>

885
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 4>mind thinks it's a good idea to make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bomb.</v>

886
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:20.470
<v Speaker 4>What that story is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially a sobering because I may </v>

887
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 4>forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the details.</v>

888
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>

889
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 4>I could have this backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Rutherford,</v>

890
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:32.950
<v Speaker 4>the two famous physicists involve to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rutherford who said we're never going to</v>

891
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:35.630
<v Speaker 4>unlock the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

892
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

893
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

894
00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:43.251
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Rutherford gave a talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that we're never going to unlock </v>

895
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:46.620
<v Speaker 4>the energy that we now know to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam and Leo Szilard the next day </v>

896
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.630
<v Speaker 4>produced the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

897
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the equations that I'm locked in the </v>

898
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.690
<v Speaker 4>next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>next and an indirect response to this </v>

899
00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:58.690
<v Speaker 4>announcement.</v>

900
00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

901
00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:59.420
<v Speaker 4>let's just wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bullshit.</v>

902
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 4>And they gave him the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>woke up and produce that.</v>

903
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 4>They produced the math that gave us the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the atomic bomb.</v>

904
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can happen really fast and if you </v>

905
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.171
<v Speaker 4>want to get those details exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to what's Stuart Russell said on </v>

906
00:44:14.171 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 4>my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

907
00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:19.181
<v Speaker 4>oppenheimer in like a really ironic </v>
<v Speaker 4>twist wasn't a Buddhist.</v>

908
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

909
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 4>he was a fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of um,</v>

910
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Hinduism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technically.</v>

911
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he taught himself Sanskrit apparently in</v>

912
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 4>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One never how much this is exaggerated,</v>

913
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:37.461
<v Speaker 4>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his publicists will tell you that he </v>

914
00:44:37.461 --> 00:44:39.720
<v Speaker 4>taught himself Sanskrit in three months </v>
<v Speaker 4>to read the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

915
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 4>which is the one of the texts of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Hinduism,</v>

916
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 4>the quote that he gave out as the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>bomb was tested.</v>

917
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 4>I've become death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>death destroyer of worlds.</v>

918
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 4>And then when you hear him saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>even more creepy because you could see </v>

919
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 4>the sort of remorse.</v>

920
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.060
<v Speaker 4>And so have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

921
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 4>I also get the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every photo of Oppenheimer.</v>

922
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.730
<v Speaker 4>He looks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just looks haunted.</v>

923
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was hanging out with weird to see him</v>

924
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:13.461
<v Speaker 4>with his general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching some documentary on the </v>

925
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 4>creation of the atom bomb and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

926
00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hanging out with these generals as </v>

927
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 4>they're probably Curtis Lemay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

928
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.250
<v Speaker 4>And you see the two of them together and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

929
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:25.251
<v Speaker 4>what a bizarre pairing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this one monkey needs this other </v>

930
00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 4>genius to make this bomb so he can drop </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on these people.</v>

931
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 4>And the guy realizes that if he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it,</v>

932
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 4>someone's going to make it and it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>be dropped on them.</v>

933
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing we are,</v>

934
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 4>we were genuinely in a race condition </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and we,</v>

935
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 4>and we didn't know how close the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

936
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:43.020
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that they weren't as close </v>
<v Speaker 4>as we feared.</v>

937
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just imagine Hitler haven't gotten there</v>

938
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

939
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:49.470
<v Speaker 4>With the help of Heisenberg and others </v>
<v Speaker 4>play at Jamie</v>

940
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:13.930
<v Speaker 7>scripture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the game test persuade to pressed him </v>

941
00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:33.070
<v Speaker 7>takes on form.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I ended up coming to worlds.</v>

942
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.890
<v Speaker 4>He does not look like a happy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a,</v>

943
00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 4>what a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's actually,</v>

944
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:53.000
<v Speaker 4>I read the history of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that effort,</v>

945
00:46:53.001 --> 00:46:54.920
<v Speaker 4>the Manhattan project and the Trinity </v>
<v Speaker 4>Test.</v>

946
00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.560
<v Speaker 4>It is super sobering because there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they move forward in,</v>

947
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:07.290
<v Speaker 4>in a context of real uncertainty about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what was going to happen.</v>

948
00:47:07.881 --> 00:47:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean there were they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the yield of the first bomb,</v>

949
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.380
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a range,</v>

950
00:47:15.381 --> 00:47:20.381
<v Speaker 4>I think of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred fold difference of opinion of </v>

951
00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 4>what they were going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing went off.</v>

952
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were some people who still </v>

953
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 4>placed some possibility a on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prospect of igniting the atmosphere.</v>

954
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:38.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just canceling all of life right </v>

955
00:47:38.851 --> 00:47:38.851
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had,</v>

956
00:47:38.851 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 4>they had spent a lot of time to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

957
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 4>they did something like due diligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were,</v>

958
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 4>many of them were confident it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was not without,</v>

959
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 4>beyond the realm of possibility for some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the people working on it.</v>

960
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.660
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we,</v>

961
00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 4>we have shown a propensity for taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly existential risks to develop </v>

962
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:02.890
<v Speaker 4>new technology because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason to develop it.</v>

963
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:07.640
<v Speaker 4>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the destruct,</v>

964
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 4>the destructive potential is so obvious </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's all destructive potential.</v>

965
00:48:11.861 --> 00:48:12.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

966
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 4>we're building the biggest bombs we </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly can build.</v>

967
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.140
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

968
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:21.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not difficult to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger.</v>

969
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 4>It's all danger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

970
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these bombs,</v>

971
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:29.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now getting into the hands of the wrong </v>

972
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.261
<v Speaker 4>people with Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so seductive because if you looked </v>

973
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:33.030
<v Speaker 4>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at in,</v>

974
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:34.210
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one light,</v>

975
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 4>it's just all upside and there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>better than intelligence is nothing more</v>

976
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 4>intrinsically desirable than </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence.</v>

977
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 4>And so to get more of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems an intrinsic good.</v>

978
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.100
<v Speaker 4>And so it takes an extra step to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

979
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this could in fact be the most dangerous</v>

980
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 4>thing we've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have to,</v>

981
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 4>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to spend a lot of time fighting</v>

982
00:48:56.771 --> 00:49:01.771
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ideological battle with people who </v>

983
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:01.771
<v Speaker 4>just think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

984
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:04.200
<v Speaker 4>just this is just all upside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what could be.</v>

985
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 4>What could go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

986
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:11.731
<v Speaker 4>you're just scare mongering and the year</v>
<v Speaker 4>just evil that you've seen too many </v>

987
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:11.731
<v Speaker 4>terminator movies.</v>

988
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Is that even possible to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

989
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.570
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not with the first.</v>

990
00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:18.900
<v Speaker 2>The first was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First one.</v>

991
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Second was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one in there that I don't think </v>

992
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I've seen all of the three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

993
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I lost touch after the second </v>

994
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any more than two.</v>

995
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

996
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's been because of the </v>

997
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 2>race because the idea that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>race to get to it,</v>

998
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.340
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's inevitable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone actually does create it and much</v>

999
00:49:43.341 --> 00:49:46.160
<v Speaker 2>like the atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll probably launched,</v>

1000
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 2>probably be launched without a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what his potential is.</v>

1001
00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.130
<v Speaker 2>That's my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified of it.</v>

1002
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I think about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1003
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I stepped back sometimes and I look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the city of Los Angeles,</v>

1004
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.820
<v Speaker 2>of the skyline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the lights go off and I'm like,</v>

1005
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.500
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all new.</v>

1006
00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Like this has only been here for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years like this,</v>

1007
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:07.250
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing here.</v>

1008
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.140
<v Speaker 2>1,700,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing.</v>

1009
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.430
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now look at it,</v>

1010
00:50:10.431 --> 00:50:13.730
<v Speaker 2>it's all lit up and there's a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>grid you see from the sky,</v>

1011
00:50:13.731 --> 00:50:15.890
<v Speaker 2>like what are we looking at 300 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>from now?</v>

1012
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we looking at with all these </v>

1013
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>things that were feverously attempting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to build and create.</v>

1014
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the,</v>

1015
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 4>our dependence on the net is sobering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1016
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:32.050
<v Speaker 4>just what you just forget about all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these highfalutin fears of,</v>

1017
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.030
<v Speaker 4>of roguey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1018
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:39.070
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a backup for the Internet </v>

1019
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.070
<v Speaker 4>and the Internet goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens in the real world a lot.</v>

1020
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.130
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is very difficult to recover from.</v>

1021
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens to your money,</v>

1022
00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1023
00:50:45.911 --> 00:50:50.911
<v Speaker 4>what is money when there is no right or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or just just imagine some malicious code</v>

1024
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.460
<v Speaker 4>just destroying the record of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

1025
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1026
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:00.290
<v Speaker 4>just to getting into the banking system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1027
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:05.291
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have men have to go look for the </v>

1028
00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:07.961
<v Speaker 4>paperwork you may or may not have in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your desk to argue that you have a </v>

1029
00:51:07.961 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of money because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1030
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 4>all those bits got scrambled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1031
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we need some,</v>

1032
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 4>all of this is just this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many aspects of this,</v>

1033
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:20.531
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that you can now credibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake audio,</v>

1034
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1035
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.850
<v Speaker 4>So someone can listen to sample,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1036
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.720
<v Speaker 4>five minutes of this podcast and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce a conversation.</v>

1037
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 4>We've never had invoices exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 4>our own.</v>

1038
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.380
<v Speaker 4>And those edits will no longer be </v>
<v Speaker 4>discernible.</v>

1039
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:38.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're basically there now and we're </v>

1040
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.660
<v Speaker 4>almost there with video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right where you could just have our </v>

1041
00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.121
<v Speaker 4>mouths moving in the correct way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go to snapchat these crazy snapchat</v>

1042
00:51:43.731 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 4>filters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know about these,</v>

1043
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 4>but my daughter did pull up the one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughter being Abraham Lincoln.</v>

1044
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking crazy.</v>

1045
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really rudimentary right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1046
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.360
<v Speaker 4>but my six year old loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She thinks it's hilarious and she </v>

1047
00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 4>constantly uses it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she just like,</v>

1048
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:04.601
<v Speaker 4>can I pay with your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she grabs my phone and then she </v>

1049
00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:04.730
<v Speaker 4>starts doing these little videos like </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another,</v>

1050
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:08.660
<v Speaker 4>their little brains like sync up </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately with the technology.</v>

1051
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if I gave it to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's be like,</v>

1052
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do I do?</v>

1053
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:15.050
<v Speaker 4>That six year old could figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1054
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Check this out.</v>

1055
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.490
<v Speaker 8>I lost my tooth</v>

1056
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.650
<v Speaker 4>if I showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I showed this to my daughters,</v>

1057
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:35.160
<v Speaker 4>you just never hear from them again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be the most captivating thing.</v>

1058
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is obviously black and white and </v>

1059
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 4>she's being silly and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious.</v>

1060
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

1061
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:46.470
<v Speaker 4>how far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is thing in the world who </v>

1062
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.440
<v Speaker 4>looks like Abraham linking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mimicking the voice.</v>

1063
00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:49.150
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you see her,</v>

1064
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.240
<v Speaker 4>her mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't discern where her mouth ends </v>

1065
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240
<v Speaker 4>and Abraham Lincoln's face begins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here.</v>

1066
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:59.170
<v Speaker 4>But what's so insidious about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology I'm talking about now is that</v>

1067
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:04.590
<v Speaker 4>someone can fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's basically what is already </v>

1068
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 4>true of Photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1069
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Where you can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be an expert to tell whether</v>

1070
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:13.081
<v Speaker 4>the person was standing next to Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump at the time because they could </v>

1071
00:53:13.081 --> 00:53:16.981
<v Speaker 4>have just been put there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with expert and expert use of </v>

1072
00:53:16.981 --> 00:53:16.981
<v Speaker 4>Photoshop.</v>

1073
00:53:16.981 --> 00:53:20.700
<v Speaker 4>But now we're talking about being able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to produce content where you are saying </v>

1074
00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>the thing that completely destroys your </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation,</v>

1075
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's pure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fake news is just fiction.</v>

1076
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 4>And so we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1077
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fix where this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1078
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:34.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just Spec,</v>

1079
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.990
<v Speaker 4>and this is again something I know very </v>
<v Speaker 4>little about,</v>

1080
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:41.991
<v Speaker 4>but I've clearly something like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>blockchain has to be a way of anchoring </v>

1081
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.100
<v Speaker 4>each piece of digital content so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a chain of custody where </v>

1082
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 4>you see exactly where this came from in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a way that's not favorable.</v>

1083
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.170
<v Speaker 4>And so if I take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1084
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:58.190
<v Speaker 4>your podcast and example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone is producing a clip that </v>

1085
00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 4>purports to be from your podcast where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying something insane,</v>

1086
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just has to be a clear fingerprint </v>

1087
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.510
<v Speaker 4>digitally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which shows whether that came from you </v>

1088
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.271
<v Speaker 4>and Jamie or whether this came from some</v>
<v Speaker 4>Macedonian hacker who just decided to </v>

1089
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:15.600
<v Speaker 4>screw with you.</v>

1090
00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's not.</v>

1091
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1092
00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that clearly we need that.</v>

1093
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:25.061
<v Speaker 2>We need that tomorrow because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is here to produce totally </v>

1094
00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:25.940
<v Speaker 2>fake content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

1095
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I am worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also worried about the idea that </v>

1096
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.440
<v Speaker 2>someone anywhere is completely in charge</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knows what's going on.</v>

1097
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:38.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always point to you remember that guy </v>

1098
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.271
<v Speaker 2>that went onstage with Obama and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretended to be a sign language </v>

1099
00:54:40.271 --> 00:54:44.200
<v Speaker 2>translator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one that was really that this guy </v>

1100
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.440
<v Speaker 2>was South Africa or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was,</v>

1101
00:54:45.441 --> 00:54:47.510
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds right.</v>

1102
00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.520
<v Speaker 2>But I forget where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1103
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:49.850
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1104
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:54.970
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was amazing because it's </v>

1105
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:57.491
<v Speaker 2>just so few people read sign language </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't it around a Mandela.</v>

1106
00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the details,</v>

1107
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:07.211
<v Speaker 2>but I remember thinking this fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is three feet away from the president </v>

1108
00:55:07.211 --> 00:55:11.350
<v Speaker 2>who was three feet away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and you would think that they </v>

1109
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:11.350
<v Speaker 2>had vetted everyone out.</v>

1110
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:15.230
<v Speaker 2>So here's this guy talking and that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just completely making things up.</v>

1111
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.620
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has no idea how to do sign language and </v>

1112
00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1113
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can happen.</v>

1114
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.100
<v Speaker 2>There was another incidence where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>had gotten in an elevator with Obama,</v>

1115
00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:33.101
<v Speaker 2>a security guard here with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a gun loaded gun in an elevator </v>

1116
00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:33.170
<v Speaker 2>with Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's screened them.</v>

1117
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just people aren't really on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

1118
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:41.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bit for my last comedy </v>

1119
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:41.860
<v Speaker 2>special about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that broke into the White House,</v>

1120
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:46.750
<v Speaker 2>but there was a woman guarding the front</v>
<v Speaker 2>door by herself and they had shut the </v>

1121
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:48.350
<v Speaker 2>alarm off because it kept going off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had a fuck up,</v>

1122
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:53.380
<v Speaker 2>just shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a guy who was on the </v>

1123
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:53.380
<v Speaker 2>lawn who's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had canines,</v>

1124
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.260
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be guarding lawn.</v>

1125
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.740
<v Speaker 2>He took his earpiece out to talk to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend on the cell phone.</v>

1126
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 2>He had a backup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a walkie talkie because they have a </v>

1127
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 2>backup one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he left that in his locker.</v>

1128
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So it was like all these steps and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy just hit the perfect sweet spot </v>

1129
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.260
<v Speaker 2>where you hopped the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran the whatever,</v>

1130
00:56:09.261 --> 00:56:11.360
<v Speaker 2>100 yards plus to get to the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>

1131
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 2>got to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was unlocked,</v>

1132
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 2>got through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a girl by herself through her </v>

1133
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.810
<v Speaker 2>to the ground and just ran through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>White House and was in there for five,</v>

1134
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.460
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a knife,</v>

1135
00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

1136
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.980
<v Speaker 4>was basically trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was basically a suicide by cop </v>

1137
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:28.980
<v Speaker 4>situation because they hadn't caught </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1138
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:33.691
<v Speaker 4>This is what's really hilarious when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that the government is </v>

1139
00:56:33.691 --> 00:56:36.211
<v Speaker 4>watching out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't even watching this guy and </v>

1140
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:36.211
<v Speaker 4>listen to what this guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got arrested.</v>

1141
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:40.890
<v Speaker 4>They pulled him over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was less than three months </v>

1142
00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 4>before that with 800 rounds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ammunition.</v>

1143
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:48.931
<v Speaker 4>He had two rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a shot gun and the ax and a machete and </v>

1144
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:54.330
<v Speaker 4>a map of Washington with a fucking x </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the White House is and they let </v>

1145
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:58.470
<v Speaker 4>them go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have.</v>

1146
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.290
<v Speaker 4>There has to be a crime there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't even watching that guy.</v>

1147
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea that they're watching you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not built as a species for </v>

1148
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:11.110
<v Speaker 4>perfect vigilance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so not perfect.</v>

1149
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:12.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so ridiculous.</v>

1150
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.630
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about even the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1151
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:16.770
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1152
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 4>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just not built for that.</v>

1153
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Twitter and twitter can confound even </v>
<v Speaker 4>the perfect vigilance,</v>

1154
00:57:25.741 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 4>but just look what happened at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oscars.</v>

1155
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.140
<v Speaker 4>That was just their only job is to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>those envelopes right.</v>

1156
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:37.470
<v Speaker 4>You've got two people with briefcases </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one guy starts tweeting and produces</v>

1157
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:39.020
<v Speaker 4>the wrong envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1158
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what happened?</v>

1159
00:57:40.241 --> 00:57:41.550
<v Speaker 4>He was tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1160
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 4>he was tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is brutal,</v>

1161
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 4>but he took a photo of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what actress,</v>

1162
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.630
<v Speaker 4>but it clearly he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have been deleted the photo,</v>

1163
00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 4>but people recovered it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1164
00:57:55.150 --> 00:58:00.150
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took a shot of somebody I don't </v>

1165
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.400
<v Speaker 4>charlise their own or somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking backstage and put it on his </v>

1166
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.221
<v Speaker 4>twitter feed and then that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the very next moment was the moment</v>

1167
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:13.441
<v Speaker 4>when he had to hand over the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>envelope and he just handed over the </v>

1168
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:19.020
<v Speaker 4>envelope for the best bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's been their only job is to get</v>

1169
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:25.111
<v Speaker 4>this straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just safeguarding the envelopes so it's </v>

1170
00:58:25.111 --> 00:58:25.360
<v Speaker 4>all adorable.</v>

1171
00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some.</v>

1172
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.840
<v Speaker 4>There's something I really enjoy about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the folly of people that.</v>

1173
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:35.970
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the main things that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>worry about with ai that are the things </v>

1174
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:40.411
<v Speaker 4>that we find cute about us being </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous like that or like the sign </v>

1175
00:58:40.411 --> 00:58:42.440
<v Speaker 4>language guy or any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that.</v>

1176
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 4>But that's the thing that computers are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at it.</v>

1177
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean one is computer to get good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of thing,</v>

1178
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.300
<v Speaker 4>but we're programming them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we,</v>

1179
00:58:50.301 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can program them to,</v>

1180
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:58.900
<v Speaker 4>to fill in the gaps for stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want.</v>

1181
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.930
<v Speaker 4>What we want to do is automate </v>
<v Speaker 4>repetitive behavior and error detection </v>

1182
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 4>that we know we're not good at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

1183
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 4>You have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a TSA screening robot that,</v>

1184
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:16.650
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these machines don't get </v>

1185
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.650
<v Speaker 4>distracted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1186
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.650
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get hungry.</v>

1187
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to take bathroom breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

1188
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:23.100
<v Speaker 4>they're not looking at the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at them and get captivated by </v>

1189
00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 4>some social glitch.</v>

1190
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that it all,</v>

1191
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:30.311
<v Speaker 4>if you have a bomb screening robot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all it will do and it will be </v>

1192
00:59:30.311 --> 00:59:30.490
<v Speaker 4>better once it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1193
00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.360
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever they visual signature or of a,</v>

1194
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 4>of a bomb is when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for one in a bag.</v>

1195
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Once computers get better at that than </v>
<v Speaker 4>people they will be.</v>

1196
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 4>They will be reliable in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people can never be.</v>

1197
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 4>And then we know that about ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's we want to,</v>

1198
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 4>we want to outsource all of that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>is driving is the perfect example,</v>

1199
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:53.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

1200
00:59:53.551 --> 00:59:56.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't have self driving cars that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are falling asleep or you know,</v>

1201
00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:01.540
<v Speaker 4>will reading billboards and while </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're driving at 80 miles an hour and </v>

1202
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we want that and,</v>

1203
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the scary scary stuff is when it can</v>

1204
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:14.290
<v Speaker 4>change itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's a principle that will allow </v>

1205
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:16.400
<v Speaker 4>it to kind of escape from our control or</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just,</v>

1206
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 4>we build something where we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>anticipated the consequences and,</v>

1207
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 4>and the incentives are wrong.</v>

1208
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 4>The incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the incentives are not aligned to make </v>

1209
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 4>us prudent in the development of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what an arms race is.</v>

1210
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 4>The worst case for that because with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>incentives are to get to the end zone as</v>

1211
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:40.331
<v Speaker 4>quickly as you can because the guy next </v>
<v Speaker 4>to you is doing the same and you don't </v>

1212
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 4>know how you don't know whether he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead of you or behind you.</v>

1213
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1214
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 4>and it's a winner take all scenario </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the amount of wealth that will </v>

1215
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.760
<v Speaker 4>go to the winner of this race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if things work,</v>

1216
01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:54.460
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this person that doesn't know,</v>

1217
01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:57.620
<v Speaker 4>if this group doesn't destroy the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>is unimaginable.</v>

1218
01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1219
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.580
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about a level of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of um,</v>

1220
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:08.010
<v Speaker 4>kind of windfall profits that we just </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't seen in any other domain.</v>

1221
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect example is the creation of the </v>

1222
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.190
<v Speaker 4>atomic bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1223
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 4>look at 70 years from the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the atomic bomb to today,</v>

1224
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 4>which is literally a blip in human </v>
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

1225
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Just a tiny little blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the United States emerges as </v>

1226
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:24.860
<v Speaker 4>the greatest superpower of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever known.</v>

1227
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:30.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to be directly </v>
<v Speaker 4>attributed to those bombs that were </v>

1228
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 4>dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean that from there on,</v>

1229
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 4>that's where everything takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at human history,</v>

1230
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 4>if you look at us from a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 4>from now,</v>

1231
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 4>it's very likely that they look at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and then they go,</v>

1232
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 4>this is the emergence of the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>empire.</v>

1233
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.710
<v Speaker 4>But this is so much bigger than that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

1234
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.760
<v Speaker 4>Because the bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the power and the bomb was just,</v>

1235
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.280
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the implicit threat that you might use </v>

1236
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.280
<v Speaker 4>them if you get pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1237
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 4>But you can't do anything with the bombs</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1238
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the resource that </v>
<v Speaker 4>does everything.</v>

1239
01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about.</v>

1240
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the cure for cancer.</v>

1241
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.280
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the best virtual </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality entertainment we're talking </v>

1242
01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.130
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1243
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.920
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1244
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 4>everything that a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you,</v>

1245
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about general human </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and beyond,</v>

1246
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.120
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about now having access </v>
<v Speaker 4>to suddenly having access to the </v>

1247
01:02:22.561 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 4>smartest people who have ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who never sleep,</v>

1248
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.991
<v Speaker 4>who never get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who never get distracted because now </v>

1249
01:02:29.991 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 4>their machines and the smartest people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have never lived,</v>

1250
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:37.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are a thousand times smarter </v>

1251
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:37.070
<v Speaker 4>than those people and getting smarter </v>
<v Speaker 4>every hour,</v>

1252
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:41.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what are they going to do for you </v>

1253
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:41.540
<v Speaker 4>when they're your slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1254
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 4>Because now you're talking about because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to feed these people.</v>

1255
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:49.220
<v Speaker 4>These are working for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just how powerful would you suddenly be </v>

1256
01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.750
<v Speaker 4>if you had 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the smartest people in the world </v>

1257
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 4>working for you full time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to be fed,</v>

1258
01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:00.950
<v Speaker 4>they never get disgruntled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't need contracts and they just </v>

1259
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>want to do whatever Joe Rogan wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do and get done and you just,</v>

1260
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.960
<v Speaker 4>you flip a switch and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 4>company,</v>

1261
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1262
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's some version of that going to </v>

1263
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:12.980
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

1264
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.661
<v Speaker 4>is it going to happen in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we get this massive dislocation </v>

1265
01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:22.241
<v Speaker 4>and in wealth inequality where all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden someone's got a company and </v>

1266
01:03:22.241 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 4>products and a business model which </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviates,</v>

1267
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 percent of the American workforce in </v>

1268
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.130
<v Speaker 4>over the span of three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you have some,</v>

1269
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.330
<v Speaker 4>some political and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1270
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 4>and economic and ethical context in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which we start sharing the wealth with </v>

1271
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:45.130
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

1272
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.740
<v Speaker 4>this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the best case scenario.</v>

1273
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:50.430
<v Speaker 4>This is when we don't destroy ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>inadvertently by,</v>

1274
01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.890
<v Speaker 4>by producing something that's hostile to</v>
<v Speaker 4>our interests.</v>

1275
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Daniel terrified.</v>

1276
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1277
01:03:55.011 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what hanging out with Sam does.</v>

1278
01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spot.</v>

1279
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.460
<v Speaker 3>We get to a high spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get a pitcher of Margaritas and we </v>

1280
01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:04.750
<v Speaker 3>just watched this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not gonna make it anyway.</v>

1281
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.100
<v Speaker 3>None of this room was going to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever when I hang out with Sam,</v>

1282
01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:12.101
<v Speaker 3>usually his wife's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like with the conversation is a </v>

1283
01:04:12.101 --> 01:04:12.101
<v Speaker 3>little less elliptic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1284
01:04:12.101 --> 01:04:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she keeps me grounded.</v>

1285
01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.390
<v Speaker 3>She is actually awesome because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's there she's like,</v>

1286
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:20.840
<v Speaker 3>just tooling on him and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he giggles and stuff like that.</v>

1287
01:04:20.841 --> 01:04:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like a completely different Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the guy who's under it,</v>

1288
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 3>like being an undertaker here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling you about how we're all going to</v>

1289
01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:27.410
<v Speaker 3>die from Ai.</v>

1290
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

1291
01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 4>she keeps me honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1292
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean the truth is it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1293
01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:38.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cautiously.</v>

1294
01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1295
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:40.870
<v Speaker 4>there's no way to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1296
01:04:40.871 --> 01:04:42.280
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no brake to pull.</v>

1297
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

1298
01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:46.840
<v Speaker 4>this is the inevitability you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing before.</v>

1299
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:52.170
<v Speaker 4>We're moving toward this thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence is the best thing in the </v>

1300
01:04:52.811 --> 01:04:53.530
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1301
01:04:53.531 --> 01:04:58.531
<v Speaker 4>intelligence is the thing that allows us</v>
<v Speaker 4>to solve every problem we have or don't </v>

1302
01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:02.941
<v Speaker 4>know we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we discovered what continually </v>

1303
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:02.941
<v Speaker 4>discovering new problems and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question is,</v>

1304
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:06.940
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some global pandemic arrives and</v>

1305
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 4>the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you find a vaccine for this thing or </v>

1306
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 4>not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1307
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Only intelligence solves that problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>for us.</v>

1308
01:05:14.321 --> 01:05:19.321
<v Speaker 4>We either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we either have the data and we can </v>

1309
01:05:19.321 --> 01:05:19.321
<v Speaker 4>interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to get that.</v>

1310
01:05:19.321 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 4>We have to design the experiments to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>the data.</v>

1311
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's.</v>

1312
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1313
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 4>there's no question of us deciding while</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got.</v>

1314
01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:29.890
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to stick with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence we've got.</v>

1315
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just,</v>

1316
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't,</v>

1317
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's other people that are working</v>

1318
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:39.481
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly right because that's just </v>

1319
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.401
<v Speaker 4>too much power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if even if we decided that as an </v>

1320
01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:41.401
<v Speaker 4>American policy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1321
01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:46.291
<v Speaker 4>we were not going to let China and North</v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea and Singapore and Iran and Israel </v>

1322
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:49.780
<v Speaker 4>and all these other countries do it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

1323
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 4>so I'm fine,</v>

1324
01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:57.470
<v Speaker 5>but right above denver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big bucket of Margarita or,</v>

1325
01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:01.100
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the meditation that has helped a,</v>

1326
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.860
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that definitely will help you.</v>

1327
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.020
<v Speaker 5>While human beings are a real thing.</v>

1328
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I wonder if you know,</v>

1329
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:15.930
<v Speaker 3>the getting enough people meditating </v>
<v Speaker 3>might improve the quality of whatever </v>

1330
01:06:16.911 --> 01:06:19.220
<v Speaker 3>gets created in the Ai community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1331
01:06:19.221 --> 01:06:22.790
<v Speaker 3>if you have people who are a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sane as a consequence of meditation</v>

1332
01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>than maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people designing these products that</v>

1333
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.970
<v Speaker 3>the rather these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1334
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>don't know if products the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff that somehow this stuff is </v>

1335
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1336
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's especially relevant for the</v>

1337
01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:40.160
<v Speaker 4>other side of that which is when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean in the near term,</v>

1338
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:42.770
<v Speaker 4>we clearly have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an employment problem.</v>

1339
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are jobs that will go away that </v>

1340
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.461
<v Speaker 4>are not coming back and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perennial problem where people need to </v>

1341
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 4>find meaning in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1342
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:58.530
<v Speaker 4>but we've always had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been such a pressing problem </v>

1343
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:02.141
<v Speaker 4>for thousands of years because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>always been so much to do just to </v>

1344
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:03.500
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now what we're.</v>

1345
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 4>In the ideal case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get to a place where there's </v>

1346
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 4>actually much less that has to be done </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have machines that do it and </v>

1347
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:17.981
<v Speaker 4>we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have seen the wisdom of mitigating </v>

1348
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:19.980
<v Speaker 4>wealth inequality to some extent</v>

1349
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 5>bilevel were so every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all,</v>

1350
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 5>all boats</v>

1351
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 4>begin to rise with this tied to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

1352
01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:30.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so whether it's universal basic income </v>

1353
01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:32.491
<v Speaker 4>or some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have some mechanism to spread the </v>

1354
01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:32.491
<v Speaker 4>wealth around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there's the</v>

1355
01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:33.090
<v Speaker 5>question of what do you do with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life?</v>

1356
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:35.550
<v Speaker 5>So what do you think people will do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1357
01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.880
<v Speaker 5>that's the easiest one is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not so easy because people </v>

1358
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:40.880
<v Speaker 5>will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are confused.</v>

1359
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.660
<v Speaker 5>People in St Louis need to get their </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit together.</v>

1360
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:45.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's giving someone free time,</v>

1361
01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:48.210
<v Speaker 5>but find a hobby man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of stuff to do.</v>

1362
01:07:48.211 --> 01:07:50.280
<v Speaker 5>If you told me that I never had to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1363
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.400
<v Speaker 5>that we just have to find things to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>all day and all my food and everything </v>

1364
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.971
<v Speaker 5>would be taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be the easiest choice I've </v>

1365
01:07:58.971 --> 01:07:59.250
<v Speaker 5>ever made in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just pursue things.</v>

1366
01:07:59.251 --> 01:08:00.960
<v Speaker 5>I would just learn how to speak a </v>
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

1367
01:08:00.961 --> 01:08:04.530
<v Speaker 5>I've learned how to play an instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd practice archery more.</v>

1368
01:08:04.531 --> 01:08:06.960
<v Speaker 5>I do Jujitsu more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1369
01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.820
<v Speaker 5>That seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so riddick,</v>

1370
01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:12.120
<v Speaker 5>that seems to me that can be solved </v>
<v Speaker 5>really easy was a guy,</v>

1371
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.680
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1372
01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I think that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced I feel that I could </v>

1373
01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.461
<v Speaker 3>fill endless swaths of of free time with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number of things that I'm interested </v>

1374
01:08:21.461 --> 01:08:26.051
<v Speaker 3>in including but not limited to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation or just hanging out with my </v>

1375
01:08:26.051 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1376
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:31.721
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are like that</v>

1377
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 4>guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be the be the easiest </v>

1378
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 4>thing to solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let them know it.</v>

1379
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Go find something fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can start running up hills,</v>

1380
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:40.740
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go up,</v>

1381
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:45.230
<v Speaker 4>take up Frisbee Golf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to shift to do.</v>

1382
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My concern is that more and more it </v>

1383
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.771
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will take the form of being merely </v>

1384
01:08:53.771 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 4>entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we'll plug into some vr.</v>

1385
01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Last scene of wally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that movie.</v>

1386
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay guys,</v>

1387
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.450
<v Speaker 3>you should maybe pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull this up,</v>

1388
01:09:02.451 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in wally.</v>

1389
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:09.610
<v Speaker 3>That's a dystopian future where </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's riding around in those </v>

1390
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:12.880
<v Speaker 3>little jazzy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mobile wheelchairs that people </v>

1391
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:19.331
<v Speaker 3>sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in Disneyland and they are also </v>

1392
01:09:19.331 --> 01:09:22.660
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got huge buckets of soda and </v>

1393
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.020
<v Speaker 3>like Turkey legs and and draped like </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of hooked over the back of the,</v>

1394
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 3>of their motorized vehicle as a monitor </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the front,</v>

1395
01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:33.761
<v Speaker 3>which is entertaining them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just obese and entertained and </v>

1396
01:09:33.761 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 3>immobile or mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not actually ambulatory</v>

1397
01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 4>is Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were.</v>

1398
01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.540
<v Speaker 4>What's happened in our lifetime that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>smartphone has made it virtually </v>

1399
01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:47.350
<v Speaker 4>impossible to be bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boredom used to be a thing like you'd.</v>

1400
01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.620
<v Speaker 4>You'd be sitting in the waiting room of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a doctor,</v>

1401
01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:55.621
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have crappy magazines and then </v>

1402
01:09:55.621 --> 01:09:55.621
<v Speaker 4>you're just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at the end,</v>

1403
01:09:55.621 --> 01:10:00.061
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't know how to meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to confront this sense of on </v>

1404
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 4>board right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a while you just go.</v>

1405
01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:07.931
<v Speaker 4>One thing you discovered when he learned</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to meditate is boredom is just an </v>

1406
01:10:07.931 --> 01:10:10.270
<v Speaker 4>inability to pay attention to anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can pay attention.</v>

1407
01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Once you learn to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1408
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.530
<v Speaker 4>even something as seemingly boring as </v>
<v Speaker 4>your breath,</v>

1409
01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.630
<v Speaker 4>it suddenly becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1410
01:10:16.631 --> 01:10:21.631
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so focused attention is intrinsically </v>

1411
01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:22.750
<v Speaker 4>pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but boredom is the state of,</v>

1412
01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:27.810
<v Speaker 4>of kind of scattered attention looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>for something that's worth paying </v>

1413
01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:30.190
<v Speaker 4>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet now with technology,</v>

1414
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.470
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to be bored again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've got,</v>

1415
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I have at least 10 years worth of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading on my phone,</v>

1416
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like if I'm standing in live,</v>

1417
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.370
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm constantly pulling this thing out as</v>

1418
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:43.180
<v Speaker 4>a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1419
01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:46.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's potentially a bad thing because you</v>

1420
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 4>for images to take this example of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of one interesting insight you get when </v>

1421
01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.060
<v Speaker 4>you learn to meditate.</v>

1422
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:59.200
<v Speaker 4>It's incredibly powerful to cut through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the illusion of boredom.</v>

1423
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to realize that boredom is,</v>

1424
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:06.310
<v Speaker 4>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not something you can become </v>

1425
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:09.690
<v Speaker 4>interested in the feeling of boredom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment you do it bites its own tail </v>

1426
01:11:10.541 --> 01:11:11.880
<v Speaker 4>and disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just like a,</v>

1427
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:15.210
<v Speaker 4>it's there no such thing as boredom when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're paying close attention</v>

1428
01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:20.260
<v Speaker 3>to your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the bad thing about the hyper </v>

1429
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:20.620
<v Speaker 3>stimulation that we get through our </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and,</v>

1430
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:25.670
<v Speaker 3>and all of technology is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost the ability to just sit back and,</v>

1431
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a less cliched term,</v>

1432
01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 3>B and w we're just constantly stimulated</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means we have trouble paying </v>

1433
01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:42.070
<v Speaker 3>attention when we're holding our kid in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lap and reading him or her a book or</v>

1434
01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:44.380
<v Speaker 3>we find ourselves without our technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a moment.</v>

1435
01:11:44.381 --> 01:11:47.210
<v Speaker 3>There was a recent study that asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>people a,</v>

1436
01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>would you rather be alone with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts or get electric shocks and a </v>

1437
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:57.061
<v Speaker 3>lot of people took the electric shocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I actually think that is a </v>

1438
01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:57.440
<v Speaker 3>fundamental problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1439
01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:02.650
<v Speaker 3>in terms of not being able to get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch with the Ra and kind of powerful,</v>

1440
01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:06.730
<v Speaker 3>although obvious fact that you're alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you exist.</v>

1441
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1442
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:09.680
<v Speaker 5>don't you think those people are idiots?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1443
01:12:09.681 --> 01:12:11.120
<v Speaker 5>you don't want electric shock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want.</v>

1444
01:12:11.121 --> 01:12:16.121
<v Speaker 5>I won't take an electric shock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to take an electric </v>

1445
01:12:16.121 --> 01:12:18.281
<v Speaker 5>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about the dude with the </v>

1446
01:12:18.281 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 5>snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie is on the ball.</v>

1447
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't want those glasses either,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I'm saying.</v>

1448
01:12:21.381 --> 01:12:26.381
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't use the glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just explores it because it's </v>

1449
01:12:26.381 --> 01:12:26.381
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I'm talking about.</v>

1450
01:12:26.381 --> 01:12:28.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not talking about rational people.</v>

1451
01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:29.750
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about lowest common </v>
<v Speaker 5>denominator.</v>

1452
01:12:29.751 --> 01:12:31.210
<v Speaker 5>People that would take an electric </v>
<v Speaker 5>shock,</v>

1453
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.870
<v Speaker 5>you would take an electric shock</v>

1454
01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.980
<v Speaker 3>study of they're not just picking idiot</v>

1455
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.060
<v Speaker 5>are they asking and what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are they phrasing the question,</v>

1456
01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:40.780
<v Speaker 5>but it also doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have</v>

1457
01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.070
<v Speaker 4>to be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

1458
01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:47.130
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we willingly grant our attention to </v>

1459
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:50.461
<v Speaker 4>things which retrospectively we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>judge produce more or less nothing but </v>

1460
01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.160
<v Speaker 4>pain for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

1461
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:59.430
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm continually thinking about </v>

1462
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:00.580
<v Speaker 4>this and rethinking about this with </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect to social media.</v>

1463
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:05.610
<v Speaker 4>Like I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I like what comes to </v>

1464
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the effect on my mind of looking </v>

1465
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.711
<v Speaker 4>at my twitter at mentioned?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I wondered that when you were asking </v>

1466
01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:10.750
<v Speaker 4>people what kind of questions they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1467
01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.410
<v Speaker 4>we should ask what some of this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's incredibly useful.</v>

1468
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.480
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking of what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're opening yourself up to the green </v>

1469
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.110
<v Speaker 4>frog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've had both kinds of experience.</v>

1470
01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:28.111
<v Speaker 4>I've had people send me articles that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have never found otherwise and </v>

1471
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:29.210
<v Speaker 4>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super useful and it's just,</v>

1472
01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:32.590
<v Speaker 4>it's like this is the perfect use of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this technology and then again,</v>

1473
01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.860
<v Speaker 4>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I get this river of green frogs and</v>

1474
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.730
<v Speaker 4>weirdness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>

1475
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:43.100
<v Speaker 4>But the to the previous point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pay attention to something for long </v>

1476
01:13:45.071 --> 01:13:50.071
<v Speaker 4>stretches of time rather than do in </v>
<v Speaker 4>something I know is good for me with my </v>

1477
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:52.530
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of spin the roulette wheel with,</v>

1478
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:57.590
<v Speaker 4>with twitter and rather often there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just this kind of toxic undercurrent of,</v>

1479
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.710
<v Speaker 4>of mental activity that it produces in </v>
<v Speaker 4>me that I'm mean.</v>

1480
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.710
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make me feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1481
01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't equip me to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>better in life.</v>

1482
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make me feel any better about</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself or other people.</v>

1483
01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:14.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1484
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.490
<v Speaker 4>if it has any net effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1485
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 4>It basically grabbed a dozen dials that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I can just sort of dimly conceive of in </v>

1486
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 4>my mind and turn them all a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>toward the negative.</v>

1487
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel a little bit worse about myself,</v>

1488
01:14:27.581 --> 01:14:32.581
<v Speaker 4>a little bit worse about my career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit worse about people will go </v>

1489
01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:34.390
<v Speaker 4>a little bit worse about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit worse about the fact that I</v>

1490
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 4>was doing this when I could have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing with my kid or or writing or </v>

1491
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:42.630
<v Speaker 4>thinking productive thoughts or </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditating or doing anything that I know</v>

1492
01:14:42.631 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 4>is that you still do this twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>compulsion,</v>

1493
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 4>you argue with people.</v>

1494
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.940
<v Speaker 4>I found that fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

1495
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go for.</v>

1496
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I go for weeks without arguments as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1497
01:14:56.771 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 4>but also you argue with people on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

1498
01:14:59.440 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1499
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.210
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>

1500
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:06.470
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just on the podcast you'll also be </v>

1501
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.470
<v Speaker 4>talking about people you're arguing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>on twitter or a.</v>

1502
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:10.180
<v Speaker 4>So the arguing is a part of your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 4>I get trolled a lot on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get trolled.</v>

1504
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.140

<v Speaker 4>you have guests who come on your podcast</v>

<v Speaker 4>and savage me on the podcast and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>troll me endlessly on twitter and abby.</v>

1506
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Abby Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well she was.</v>

1507
01:15:23.711 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't try.</v>

1508
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1509
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1510
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:26.260
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she hates me,</v>

1511
01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:27.460
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1512
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 4>I haven't noticed her at trolling me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1513
01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:32.080
<v Speaker 4>you got in a room with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would calm down.</v>

1514
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.200
<v Speaker 4>She just has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that have radical </v>

1515
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:37.200
<v Speaker 4>misconceptions of who you are.</v>

1516
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:37.200
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1517
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you heard the josh steps a </v>
<v Speaker 4>patent Oswald thing or Patton Oswalt </v>

1518
01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:45.630
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't listen to it because he went off </v>

1519
01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 4>the rails pack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went off the rails,</v>

1520
01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 4>like Hannibal style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When are you thinking of Andy Kindler?</v>

1521
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1522
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

1523
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.700
<v Speaker 4>So sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I connect patents?</v>

1524
01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good patents.</v>

1525
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Very smart and very reasonable as is </v>
<v Speaker 4>andy for the most,</v>

1526
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.380
<v Speaker 4>most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so,</v>

1527
01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.200
<v Speaker 4>so the end is kind of discovered this </v>
<v Speaker 4>very late.</v>

1528
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I kept seeing this guy.</v>

1529
01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept seeing him in my twitter feed,</v>

1530
01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.620
<v Speaker 4>Andy Kindler and they can learn and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized,</v>

1531
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:13.540
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is actually,</v>

1532
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.970
<v Speaker 4>he seems to be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an established comic.</v>

1533
01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:20.730
<v Speaker 4>He seems to be friends with people who I</v>
<v Speaker 4>really respect who I don't know.</v>

1534
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:21.240
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1535
01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 4>like Sarah Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I don't know personally,</v>

1536
01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:28.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've communicated a little bit on </v>

1537
01:16:28.891 --> 01:16:28.891
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like I,</v>

1538
01:16:28.891 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just nothing but a pure fan of </v>

1539
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 4>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Gaffigan,</v>

1540
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 4>other big comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I totally respect.</v>

1541
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how close he is with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1542
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:41.580
<v Speaker 4>but he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has endless energy for vilifying me </v>

1543
01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.370
<v Speaker 4>as a racist and a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1544
01:16:42.371 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a madman.</v>

1545
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:49.350
<v Speaker 4>And I discovered so I did a search of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his twitter feed and he's got hundreds </v>

1546
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:54.120
<v Speaker 4>and hundreds of tweets where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going after me in the most retail </v>

1547
01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.120
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

1548
01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.730
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1549
01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.880
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted out a can anyone recommend 500</v>
<v Speaker 4>seat halls and all these cities and I </v>

1550
01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 4>think your friend is Duncan Trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend of yours.</v>

1551
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Duncan wrote back saying,</v>

1552
01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dma,</v>

1553
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I've got a great place in Boston or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1554
01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:12.450
<v Speaker 4>And then Andy kindler jumped into that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thread talking to Duncan saying,</v>

1555
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.810
<v Speaker 4>don't help him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duncan,</v>

1556
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.140
<v Speaker 4>he's a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1557
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:20.230
<v Speaker 4>So like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is Andy kindler just got endless </v>

1558
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:20.230
<v Speaker 4>energy for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I,</v>

1559
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.921
<v Speaker 4>then I looked at what he was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had been doing it for years and I </v>

1560
01:17:23.921 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 4>wasn't aware of it just to you just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and Bill Maher,</v>

1561
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:31.361
<v Speaker 4>he hates Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you've got another guy on this </v>

1562
01:17:31.361 --> 01:17:31.361
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

1563
01:17:31.361 --> 01:17:34.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm hunter mats once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1564
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:39.770
<v Speaker 4>So he was on here and I actually had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go back and watch what he said here </v>

1565
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:43.211
<v Speaker 4>because I had been getting so much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this on twitter and I mean it's </v>

1566
01:17:43.211 --> 01:17:43.400
<v Speaker 4>incredibly common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are tweeting at me saying,</v>

1567
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.540
<v Speaker 4>why won't you debate hunter is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is Matt?</v>

1568
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why won't you debate hunter mass?</v>

1569
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 4>I went back and looked at what he said </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1570
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half of it frankly didn't make any </v>

1571
01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:55.560
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1572
01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:59.170
<v Speaker 4>but his attacks on me on twitter are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most juvenile.</v>

1573
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:04.241
<v Speaker 4>It's like the idea that he thinks this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a way he's going to establish a </v>

1574
01:18:04.241 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 4>conversation with me by sending me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweets and then sending me 400,</v>

1575
01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 4>which say you're scared to debate me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1576
01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1577
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1578
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:15.860
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1579
01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:20.861
<v Speaker 4>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but taking a terrible socially retarded </v>

1580
01:18:20.861 --> 01:18:21.950
<v Speaker 4>approach to establishing a debate.</v>

1581
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:26.950
<v Speaker 4>And I've contacted Brian Cowen about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and Brian Cowen contacted hunter </v>

1582
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:27.050
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1583
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:29.840
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he continues to do crazy behavior.</v>

1584
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:32.190
<v Speaker 4>He said he wouldn't do it anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he gives more.</v>

1585
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I look,</v>

1586
01:18:33.771 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see him somewhere in there,</v>

1587
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 4>but then there's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Cernovich,</v>

1588
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:43.181
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's actually has effects on the real </v>

1589
01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:43.181
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1590
01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Mike Cernovich is again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a twitter troll.</v>

1591
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1592
01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 4>one of these other guys who's challenged</v>
<v Speaker 4>me to debate him and uh,</v>

1593
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:50.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1594
01:18:50.771 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

1595
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.730
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no possibility to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suitable dialogue,</v>

1596
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.770
<v Speaker 4>spend less time on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Cernovich's was just on 60 minutes.</v>

1597
01:18:57.771 --> 01:18:58.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1598
01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:02.300
<v Speaker 4>he's in the world and he's affecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's psyche.</v>

1599
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1600
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1601
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can come back.</v>

1602
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:07.920
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

1603
01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not the nine times out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking just makes me think,</v>

1604
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:18.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's an illusion because if you </v>

1605
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.531
<v Speaker 4>met most of these people with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they came up to you at a conference </v>

1606
01:19:20.531 --> 01:19:20.531
<v Speaker 4>or at a book signing or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1607
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:25.040
<v Speaker 4>after a Gig of yours and you thought you</v>
<v Speaker 4>had more information about them,</v>

1608
01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:27.530
<v Speaker 4>you saw all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1609
01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 4>all of the crazy coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1610
01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:33.570
<v Speaker 4>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to pay any time.</v>

1611
01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:36.230
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what this guy is saying.</v>

1612
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Whereas on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is,</v>

1613
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.760
<v Speaker 4>has the same stature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whether it's a Washington Post </v>

1614
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.781
<v Speaker 4>columnist who's tweeting at me or some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy like hunter who I had no idea </v>

1615
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:52.511
<v Speaker 4>who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's telling me I've got something </v>

1616
01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:52.511
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1617
01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 4>everything has the same stature and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1618
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:55.920
<v Speaker 4>there's no signal to noise sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1619
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1620
01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:59.300
<v Speaker 4>you fucked up because you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1621
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.140
<v Speaker 4>both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said candy man five times and now </v>

1622
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.751
<v Speaker 4>you've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You talked about him right now on this </v>

1623
01:20:07.751 --> 01:20:10.301
<v Speaker 4>project,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the first time I've ever </v>

1624
01:20:10.301 --> 01:20:11.831
<v Speaker 4>mentioned the gun out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll go in and talk to you before </v>

1625
01:20:11.831 --> 01:20:11.831
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm bringing it to you because you you,</v>

1626
01:20:11.831 --> 01:20:12.700
<v Speaker 4>but you created it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

1627
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was his.</v>

1628
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.900
<v Speaker 4>It was his podcast with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kicked this whole thing on.</v>

1629
01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.840
<v Speaker 4>100 was going to do that and I know for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fact that hunter is actually a fan of </v>

1630
01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.701
<v Speaker 4>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when hunter is trying got a </v>

1631
01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:25.701
<v Speaker 4>strange way of showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a smart way.</v>

1632
01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I think what he's trying to do and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1633
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:32.500
<v Speaker 4>when I was trying to hold his feet to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire and get some sort of a logical </v>

1634
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.860
<v Speaker 4>definition of what you do wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really didn't have anything we'll hit</v>

1635
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 4>but he thinks he does and he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did he,</v>

1636
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 4>when I talked to them about it and send </v>
<v Speaker 4>half of what he said about Dawkins and </v>

1637
01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.801
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was totally wrong of what he said </v>

1638
01:20:48.801 --> 01:20:48.801
<v Speaker 4>about the relevant biology was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's just,</v>

1639
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.020
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have his shit together,</v>

1640
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 4>but he thinks he does and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1641
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:02.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a level of arrogance and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in civility and just kind of a lack </v>

1642
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:09.771
<v Speaker 4>of charity in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in interacting with other people's </v>

1643
01:21:09.771 --> 01:21:13.130
<v Speaker 4>views,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is now kind of getting rebranded </v>

1644
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:16.950
<v Speaker 4>on the Internet as just just American </v>
<v Speaker 4>can do Chutzpah.</v>

1645
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1646
01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's given us trump,</v>

1647
01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:23.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you've got a trump as the </v>

1648
01:21:23.811 --> 01:21:23.811
<v Speaker 4>ultimate example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like the cartoon version of,</v>

1649
01:21:23.811 --> 01:21:27.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a person who doesn't know anything </v>

1650
01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.741
<v Speaker 4>relevant to the enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who doesn't show any aptitude for </v>

1651
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 4>civilly engaging with differences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>

1652
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.320
<v Speaker 4>And this thing gets amplified to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the place of greatest prominence.</v>

1653
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:47.541
<v Speaker 4>Now in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's on social media or many </v>

1654
01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 4>people on social media are playing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same game.</v>

1655
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:51.060
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Cernovich is another,</v>

1656
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just malignant example of this where you</v>

1657
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:57.360
<v Speaker 4>have someone who's got a fairly large </v>
<v Speaker 4>following.</v>

1658
01:21:57.361 --> 01:21:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not as big as yours,</v>

1659
01:21:58.771 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1660
01:21:59.401 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very engaged following.</v>

1661
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.530
<v Speaker 4>This whole trump phenomenon has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>

1662
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1663
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.190
<v Speaker 4>shown me that Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if a small percentage of,</v>

1664
01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:13.191
<v Speaker 4>of one's audience can have like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times the energy of the rest of your </v>

1665
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:16.080
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whenever I went against trump on my</v>

1666
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 4>podcast or this is still the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the level of,</v>

1667
01:22:20.581 --> 01:22:25.581
<v Speaker 4>of pain it causes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the sort of feedback space is </v>

1668
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.830
<v Speaker 4>completely out of proportion to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers of people who are,</v>

1669
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.680
<v Speaker 4>who are on that side of the argument.</v>

1670
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.480
<v Speaker 4>And it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's incredibly energized,</v>

1671
01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:38.481
<v Speaker 4>but it's just this weird style of self </v>
<v Speaker 4>promotion where you'd.</v>

1672
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:40.710
<v Speaker 4>All you do is that you brag about </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

1673
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:42.080
<v Speaker 4>you say you're the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1674
01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1675
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:48.140
<v Speaker 4>you're someone who has absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis to back up those claims.</v>

1676
01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:53.361
<v Speaker 4>And yet an audience thrills to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of arrogance and an empty boast.</v>

1677
01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.540
<v Speaker 4>It's just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But well there's a,</v>

1678
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.600
<v Speaker 4>there's a big issue I think online where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people find likeminded people and then </v>

1679
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 4>they develop these communities where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they</v>

1680
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 5>just support each other and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just have these,</v>

1681
01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 5>these gigantic groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1682
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:16.771
<v Speaker 5>not even necessarily gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but groups of people that find any </v>

1683
01:23:16.771 --> 01:23:17.920
<v Speaker 5>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like for me,</v>

1684
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.550
<v Speaker 5>you know what it is flat earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1685
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.040
<v Speaker 5>I get trolled by people all day that </v>
<v Speaker 5>claim I'm a sellout because I don't </v>

1686
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 5>believe the earth is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mrs Reel.</v>

1687
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:29.340
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't think that there's a,</v>

1688
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1689
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I think this phenomenon that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>describing is both,</v>

1690
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has really serious negative </v>

1691
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also has some beauty on the same.</v>

1692
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.730
<v Speaker 3>By the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got parents,</v>

1693
01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world who've got children </v>

1694
01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:47.850
<v Speaker 3>with a rare disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can connect on the internet and</v>

1695
01:23:47.851 --> 01:23:51.190
<v Speaker 3>bond over that and share tips and Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1696
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.560
<v Speaker 3>So it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>

1697
01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.410
<v Speaker 3>they're both outgrowths of the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of phenomenon,</v>

1698
01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:57.810
<v Speaker 3>but he can be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see the,</v>

1699
01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.450
<v Speaker 3>the really difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1700
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of this in our politics </v>

1701
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

1702
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1703
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.200
<v Speaker 5>I think we're talking about two </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

1704
01:24:06.201 --> 01:24:07.940
<v Speaker 5>You think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm talking about confirmation bias.</v>

1705
01:24:07.941 --> 01:24:09.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>get together and say,</v>

1706
01:24:09.831 --> 01:24:14.831
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously I'm woke in the earth is flat </v>

1707
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:16.070
<v Speaker 5>and pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an analogy allows ball,</v>

1708
01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:18.440
<v Speaker 5>yes it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are different things.</v>

1709
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 5>The groups of people that will find </v>
<v Speaker 5>communities where maybe your child has </v>

1710
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:27.581
<v Speaker 5>autism and there's some sort of an issue</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can be mitigated with diet and </v>

1711
01:24:27.581 --> 01:24:31.990
<v Speaker 5>parents have had some success with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they could give you some </v>

1712
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:35.891
<v Speaker 5>enlightening information and you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate with each other and that's </v>

1713
01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:39.071
<v Speaker 5>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful and I'm some of the </v>

1714
01:24:39.071 --> 01:24:39.350
<v Speaker 5>hashtags that people use that they find </v>
<v Speaker 5>search through.</v>

1715
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.560
<v Speaker 5>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know that these little </v>

1716
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.670
<v Speaker 5>communities that you bond,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're not those those ideas.</v>

1717
01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:49.400
<v Speaker 5>There's no confirmation bias in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>

1718
01:24:49.401 --> 01:24:54.401
<v Speaker 5>but there's confirmation bias and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that trump is the man is </v>

1719
01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:54.860
<v Speaker 5>confirmation bias and the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth is flat.</v>

1720
01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.120
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you just huddle in those little </v>

1721
01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:00.680
<v Speaker 5>communities and just bark the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>noises that everybody else barks,</v>

1722
01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.390
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of sense of community </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that too.</v>

1723
01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.080
<v Speaker 5>And people love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love being a part of a fucking </v>

1724
01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:09.770
<v Speaker 5>team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's a stupid team of green frog</v>

1725
01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840
<v Speaker 3>and you don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to listen to other </v>

1726
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.600
<v Speaker 3>people's views and you get deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply entrenched.</v>

1727
01:25:15.601 --> 01:25:20.601
<v Speaker 3>I think we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing this all through our </v>

1728
01:25:20.601 --> 01:25:20.601
<v Speaker 3>politics and media right now.</v>

1729
01:25:20.601 --> 01:25:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you also see when you go to those </v>

1730
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.110
<v Speaker 5>people's pages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I do often,</v>

1731
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't engage with people in a negative</v>
<v Speaker 5>way online very often.</v>

1732
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rarely.</v>

1733
01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.890
<v Speaker 5>Do you not look at your ad mentions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you?</v>

1734
01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:31.620
<v Speaker 5>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what,</v>

1735
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:33.910
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just like to just go on about my day.</v>

1736
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.560
<v Speaker 5>I've found that the negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences that you're discussing,</v>

1737
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rare that I go down the rabbit hole</v>

1738
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:44.480
<v Speaker 5>and I go for days without looking at at </v>
<v Speaker 5>mentioned.</v>

1739
01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:46.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's more that if I publish </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1740
01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:49.390
<v Speaker 5>if I asked for feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see the feedback.</v>

1741
01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did anything wrong?</v>

1742
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as your friend.</v>

1743
01:25:53.531 --> 01:25:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel like there's nothing wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1744
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I look at my app mentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1745
01:25:57.170 --> 01:25:58.850
<v Speaker 5>but you can function in a very different</v>
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>

1746
01:25:58.851 --> 01:26:00.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not pushing controversial stuff.</v>

1747
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not.</v>

1748
01:26:02.581 --> 01:26:03.660
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1749
01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

1750
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:05.930
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1751
01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:08.180
<v Speaker 5>I was just more worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1752
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.240
<v Speaker 5>back to your psyche like it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you need a a little bit of a middle </v>

1753
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stay offline after UFC is for the most</v>

1754
01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:19.310
<v Speaker 5>part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when I get the most crazy.</v>

1755
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 5>People said if there's any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial decision,</v>

1756
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.040
<v Speaker 5>but are they criticizing you for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something you said or they get fucking </v>

1757
01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 5>mad at my commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll just disagree with who I thought</v>

1758
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:29.970
<v Speaker 5>water and when they're so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>vicious about it.</v>

1759
01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:31.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just yell.</v>

1760
01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:34.160
<v Speaker 5>Just yell on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to see any of that.</v>

1761
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:39.161
<v Speaker 5>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with millions and </v>

1762
01:26:39.161 --> 01:26:42.250
<v Speaker 5>millions of people and who knows how </v>
<v Speaker 5>many of them are rational when you're </v>

1763
01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:42.250
<v Speaker 5>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1764
01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:45.461
<v Speaker 5>there's a bit that I had one of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>specials where I was talking about the </v>

1765
01:26:45.461 --> 01:26:45.830
<v Speaker 5>number of people that are stupid in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1766
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Like if you get a room full of 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1767
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 5>the idea that one person isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 5>complete fucking idiot.</v>

1768
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.420
<v Speaker 5>Of course you're being very charitable </v>
<v Speaker 5>being shared in one,</v>

1769
01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:00.700
<v Speaker 5>but if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about 300 million people </v>

1770
01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 5>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus that's 3 million fucking idiots.</v>

1771
01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you have 3 million fucking idiots </v>

1772
01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.251
<v Speaker 5>and all your ad mentions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at your ad mentions and $3 </v>

1773
01:27:09.251 --> 01:27:12.501
<v Speaker 5>million comments are saying you're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking moron and there's just too many </v>

1774
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are,</v>

1775
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:18.320
<v Speaker 5>they're not manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The numbers of human beings you interact</v>

1776
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:23.321
<v Speaker 5>with online are not manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anytime anything gets negative or </v>

1777
01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 5>insulting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just check out.</v>

1778
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:26.180
<v Speaker 5>I just next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>

1779
01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.340
<v Speaker 5>next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't pay attention because you can't.</v>

1780
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 5>But if I fucked up and I know I fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

1781
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I do is I admit that I fuck you and</v>

1782
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 5>I talk about it and I apologize and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1783
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm flawed.</v>

1784
01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made a mistake.</v>

1785
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then just step away.</v>

1786
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.380
<v Speaker 5>Let the fucking chaos ensue and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>comments,</v>

1787
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:47.640
<v Speaker 5>but all the people call you a shill and </v>
<v Speaker 5>a whatever.</v>

1788
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Let all that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't let it in like you're letting </v>

1789
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:53.870
<v Speaker 5>it in and then you stew on it and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to bring up,</v>

1790
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:59.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hunter and all these other people and </v>

1791
01:27:59.200 --> 01:27:59.770
<v Speaker 5>you're letting them way too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1792
01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.130
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1793
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:03.400
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I perhaps I gave a false impression of,</v>

1794
01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:08.420
<v Speaker 5>of how under my skin this has gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the fact that you talked about it </v>

1795
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:08.420
<v Speaker 5>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those too much.</v>

1796
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:08.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1797
01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's a huge consequence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's given us trump this way,</v>

1798
01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.680
<v Speaker 5>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that this style of </v>

1799
01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 5>communication is attractive to so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1800
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.300
<v Speaker 5>The fact that you can bluff and bluster </v>
<v Speaker 5>and empty boast and lives with it being </v>

1801
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.370
<v Speaker 5>caught in lies without consequence.</v>

1802
01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that the people never admit </v>

1803
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 5>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

1804
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:33.750
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1805
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.450
<v Speaker 5>what you just described to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

1806
01:28:35.451 --> 01:28:36.730
<v Speaker 5>And which I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1807
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 5>you make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to hear about it.</v>

1808
01:28:38.871 --> 01:28:40.730
<v Speaker 5>You want to correct it as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>

1809
01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:45.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the antithesis of what we're </v>

1810
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:45.760
<v Speaker 5>seeing now in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1811
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 5>it made when has trump admitted a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mistake,</v>

1812
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.960
<v Speaker 5>but isn't the difference being that </v>
<v Speaker 5>neither you nor I have any desire to </v>

1813
01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.921
<v Speaker 5>control anything like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be the leader of </v>

1814
01:28:56.921 --> 01:28:56.921
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1815
01:28:56.921 --> 01:28:56.921
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you want effective.</v>

1816
01:28:56.921 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Can we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want good ideas too?</v>

1817
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:01.220
<v Speaker 5>I am sure and you want the truth to win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want the truth to propagate.</v>

1818
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 5>We want facts to</v>

1819
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 4>propagate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to be able to correct errors,</v>

1820
01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 4>whether they're your own or others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're consequential.</v>

1821
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:11.690
<v Speaker 4>And I think that we need a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a common ethic where align has </v>

1822
01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 4>real consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1823
01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:17.970
<v Speaker 4>so many people are trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the antidote to fake news?</v>

1824
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one antidote is to be caught.</v>

1825
01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Line has to be devastating for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>career,</v>

1826
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it hit politically,</v>

1827
01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 4>journalistically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>academically as a,</v>

1828
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:37.070
<v Speaker 4>as a public intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to be caught in a whopping lie </v>

1829
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:41.350
<v Speaker 4>without a will require at minimum some </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious atonement.</v>

1830
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.000
<v Speaker 4>And historically it has been absolutely</v>

1831
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:46.420
<v Speaker 3>and it in many spheres</v>

1832
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.560
<v Speaker 4>we have slipped those rails just to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a degree that I've never thought </v>

1833
01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.131
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going lightspeed right into the </v>

1834
01:29:55.131 --> 01:29:55.131
<v Speaker 4>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1835
01:29:55.131 --> 01:29:58.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about people have figured </v>

1836
01:29:58.490 --> 01:30:00.471
<v Speaker 4>out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to use dishonesty as extra fuel.</v>

1837
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1838
01:30:02.761 --> 01:30:03.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1839
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.560
<v Speaker 4>the whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nitrous oxide boost in those hacky </v>

1840
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:08.560
<v Speaker 4>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1841
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like we can use this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1842
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:15.260
<v Speaker 4>And the getting the way you behave when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get caught just,</v>

1843
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 4>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just go fuck yourself.</v>

1844
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Just redounds to your credibility in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1845
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:23.490
<v Speaker 4>among your tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1846
01:30:23.491 --> 01:30:25.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like this guy is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1847
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:25.900
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1848
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:30.910
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he so fully doesn't give a shit what </v>

1849
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:31.630
<v Speaker 4>people think that he can catch him in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lie and just watch how he,</v>

1850
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.760
<v Speaker 4>he gets out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1851
01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:34.500
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

1852
01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1853
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:35.610
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm,</v>

1854
01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 4>when I was bringing up these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Cernovich,</v>

1855
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1856
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:39.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

1857
01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1858
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I trolled Crna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided to troll Cernovich one day and</v>

1859
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:44.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was hilarious and I,</v>

1860
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 4>it was just nothing but fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was only topic about that.</v>

1861
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:54.220
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing that bothers me is that </v>

1862
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 4>this has real political consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that this is a,</v>

1863
01:30:56.970 --> 01:31:01.970
<v Speaker 4>this is a time period where we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of adolescent stage of </v>

1864
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:03.880
<v Speaker 4>communication online where you can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>away</v>

1865
01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:09.130
<v Speaker 3>saying things that are dishonest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there might be some sort of a way </v>

1866
01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:09.740
<v Speaker 3>to mitigate that in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There might be some.</v>

1867
01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:15.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should act like </v>
<v Speaker 3>dishonesty and bluff and bluster to use </v>

1868
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.000
<v Speaker 3>a phrase you used before is started </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow knew to the human repertoire.</v>

1869
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The acceptance of it seems to be though </v>

1870
01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.971
<v Speaker 3>I think we're in a period where that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>true and I think it is aided and abetted</v>

1871
01:31:25.611 --> 01:31:30.611
<v Speaker 3>by technology and social networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with your diagnosis on many </v>

1872
01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:31.340
<v Speaker 3>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1873
01:31:31.341 --> 01:31:32.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having an interesting conversation</v>

1874
01:31:32.901 --> 01:31:36.530
<v Speaker 3>with a guy that you introduced me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Goldstein,</v>

1875
01:31:36.531 --> 01:31:38.470
<v Speaker 3>who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1876
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:41.330
<v Speaker 3>eminent meditation teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become my meditation teacher,</v>

1877
01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:43.170
<v Speaker 3>old friend of Sam's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying,</v>

1878
01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:45.170
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about the current </v>
<v Speaker 3>political situation.</v>

1879
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:48.170
<v Speaker 3>He used a phrase that I like when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking him what he thought about it,</v>

1880
01:31:48.171 --> 01:31:53.171
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of slotting into geological </v>

1881
01:31:53.171 --> 01:31:55.781
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that actually makes some </v>

1882
01:31:55.781 --> 01:31:55.781
<v Speaker 3>sense not to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1883
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that I'm just viewing it from a</v>

1884
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:05.130
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm widening the Lens to look at the </v>

1885
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:07.810
<v Speaker 2>broad scope of human history to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1886
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time we've got these ups and downs.</v>

1887
01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He's getting to the top of the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>near Denver with a big bucket of </v>

1888
01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Margarita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly right.</v>

1889
01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.670
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just lucked out with binoculars,</v>

1890
01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.900
<v Speaker 2>watch the bombs go off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to get water out of the </v>

1891
01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.211
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a solar powered generator and make </v>

1892
01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.230
<v Speaker 2>good Margarita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1893
01:32:31.231 --> 01:32:34.270
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't seem to me that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

1894
01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>It feels like this is just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some spectacular moment in history where</v>

1895
01:32:37.661 --> 01:32:40.510
<v Speaker 2>people were Rah Rah Nixon and now they </v>
<v Speaker 2>look back and go,</v>

1896
01:32:40.511 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nixon was a fucking liar and a buffoon.</v>

1897
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take</v>

1898
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:49.370
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a point I've made before and I </v>

1899
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380
<v Speaker 4>don't think it's original with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think other people have made it,</v>

1900
01:32:49.381 --> 01:32:54.381
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my claim is that if trump were one 10th </v>

1901
01:32:54.631 --> 01:32:57.540
<v Speaker 4>as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would appear much worse.</v>

1902
01:32:57.570 --> 01:33:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Because like everything he does now is </v>
<v Speaker 4>as appearing against a background of so </v>

1903
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:06.210
<v Speaker 4>many lies and so much craziness that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can barely even weight its value.</v>

1904
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:07.980
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean just so I just,</v>

1905
01:33:07.981 --> 01:33:12.981
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the things I find useful </v>

1906
01:33:12.981 --> 01:33:12.981
<v Speaker 4>about twitter because I follow some very</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting people.</v>

1907
01:33:12.981 --> 01:33:15.780
<v Speaker 4>And so Anne Applebom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Washington Post columnist,</v>

1908
01:33:15.781 --> 01:33:19.380
<v Speaker 4>it was just awesome on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone should follow her.</v>

1909
01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.700
<v Speaker 4>She just keeps hammering trump with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with her own points and other stuff that</v>

1910
01:33:23.701 --> 01:33:26.320
<v Speaker 4>she finds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1911
01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:32.150
<v Speaker 4>she just pointed out that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did anyone notice that trumped trump </v>

1912
01:33:32.150 --> 01:33:36.180
<v Speaker 4>threatened a war with North Korea two </v>
<v Speaker 4>days ago?</v>

1913
01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:42.290
<v Speaker 4>It was in the financial times and yet no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one can talk about it because no one </v>

1914
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:43.560
<v Speaker 4>believes him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1915
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1916
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:49.340
<v Speaker 4>it's like we have a president whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech has now become so denuded of </v>

1917
01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:51.570
<v Speaker 4>truth value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1918
01:33:51.571 --> 01:33:56.571
<v Speaker 4>Perceived truth value that he can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1919
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.190
<v Speaker 4>where if China doesn't handle North </v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea,</v>

1920
01:33:59.191 --> 01:34:04.191
<v Speaker 4>we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no one even feels like they have to </v>

1921
01:34:04.191 --> 01:34:08.280
<v Speaker 4>ask a followup question on that topic </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it just,</v>

1922
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 4>everyone assumes as an empty bluff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1923
01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:15.980
<v Speaker 4>images imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you've just stepped back into the </v>

1924
01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:18.231
<v Speaker 4>previous presidency of Obama had said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if China doesn't handle North Korea,</v>

1925
01:34:18.781 --> 01:34:23.340
<v Speaker 4>we will write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be top of the fold.</v>

1926
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:26.250
<v Speaker 4>This is all we're talking about today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1927
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just comes out of a blizzard </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1928
01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:31.400
<v Speaker 4>of inanity and craziness that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1929
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:31.900
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1930
01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:32.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1931
01:34:32.630 --> 01:34:34.450
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going after Meryl Streep is,</v>

1932
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:37.670
<v Speaker 4>he's lying about Obama wiretapping him </v>
<v Speaker 4>now his,</v>

1933
01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:40.850
<v Speaker 4>he's threatening war with North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1934
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:42.370
<v Speaker 4>nobody knows what to talk about.</v>

1935
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:43.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1936
01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:48.710
<v Speaker 4>the consequence of this is we have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>president who not only can he not be </v>

1937
01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:54.861
<v Speaker 4>trusted to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can be trusted to lie when ever he </v>

1938
01:34:55.021 --> 01:34:58.780
<v Speaker 4>thinks that suits his purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now so,</v>

1939
01:34:58.820 --> 01:34:59.360
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

1940
01:34:59.361 --> 01:34:59.640
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1941
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.660
<v Speaker 4>the state of mind that everyone's in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the press in listening to him </v>

1942
01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 4>is just his to take potentially the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious things in the world.</v>

1943
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Not seriously and the least serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in the world.</v>

1944
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1945
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Meryl Streep or what he thinks of her </v>
<v Speaker 4>acting,</v>

1946
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:17.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that becomes a,</v>

1947
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 4>that dominates a whole new cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very upside down,</v>

1948
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be to be quite new as </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposed to the or are perennial,</v>

1949
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:29.861
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like we're in a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>different space now with the </v>

1950
01:35:29.861 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 4>consequences of of misinformation and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly are.</v>

1951
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:37.331
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that they're connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about before we said </v>

1952
01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:40.151
<v Speaker 4>that people would rather be electrocuted</v>
<v Speaker 4>than to be alone with their thoughts </v>

1953
01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 4>that we have gotten to this weird place </v>
<v Speaker 4>with our society,</v>

1954
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:48.221
<v Speaker 4>with our civilization where we've made </v>
<v Speaker 4>things so easy and made people so soft,</v>

1955
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:50.990
<v Speaker 4>so dependent upon technology.</v>

1956
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:54.360
<v Speaker 4>We've slotted out these paths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these predetermined patterns of behavior</v>

1957
01:35:54.361 --> 01:35:59.361
<v Speaker 4>to people for people to follow where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can just sort of plug into a </v>

1958
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:01.370
<v Speaker 4>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a right wing or left wing,</v>

1959
01:36:01.371 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 4>one with very little room for personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought at all.</v>

1960
01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Very little room for objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasoning.</v>

1961
01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.430
<v Speaker 4>We've sort of made it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We baby.</v>

1962
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:14.910
<v Speaker 3>I do think that it's imperative if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be a good citizen to have a </v>

1963
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:19.180
<v Speaker 3>varied media diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have a clear view of</v>

1964
01:36:19.181 --> 01:36:24.181
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all you're reading it well for the </v>

1965
01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:24.880
<v Speaker 3>New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1966
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I think you have nothing against the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York Times or bright part,</v>

1967
01:36:27.161 --> 01:36:32.161
<v Speaker 3>but I think you need to read many things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and follow up many different sorts of </v>

1968
01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:33.070
<v Speaker 3>people on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just because you want to troll them,</v>

1969
01:36:33.071 --> 01:36:38.071
<v Speaker 3>but because you actually want to listen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to what they have to say and take it </v>

1970
01:36:38.071 --> 01:36:38.071
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1971
01:36:38.071 --> 01:36:38.820
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times really fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're really fucked up is well,</v>

1972
01:36:38.821 --> 01:36:40.060
<v Speaker 3>they said that they're going to</v>

1973
01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:45.410
<v Speaker 4>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to rededicate themselves </v>

1974
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:46.830
<v Speaker 4>to reporting the truth and read like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1975
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Why'd she say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1976
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.550
<v Speaker 4>I wish I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I was in the office.</v>

1977
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:52.980
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just sends the wrong message.</v>

1978
01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:56.340
<v Speaker 4>We weren't into the truth that says they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are biased.</v>

1979
01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.490
<v Speaker 4>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1980
01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:01.650
<v Speaker 4>as they were by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>

1981
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:07.590
<v Speaker 4>the enemy is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is was so grotesque in this case that it</v>

1982
01:37:09.151 --> 01:37:14.151
<v Speaker 4>was impossible to not have been biased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seemed an abdication of responsibility </v>

1983
01:37:14.151 --> 01:37:19.041
<v Speaker 4>and I feel it myself like people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything I say against trump from a </v>

1984
01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:21.660
<v Speaker 4>trump person sounds like mirror partisan</v>
<v Speaker 4>bias.</v>

1985
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:26.550
<v Speaker 4>There's zero connection to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democratic Party or two.</v>

1986
01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1987
01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:33.230
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no partisan bias and that every </v>

1988
01:37:33.230 --> 01:37:36.150
<v Speaker 4>100 percent of what I want to say about </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump does not apply to some other </v>

1989
01:37:36.571 --> 01:37:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Republican who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1990
01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:40.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just a stands for things that I don't</v>

1991
01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.540
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>policies I might not like.</v>

1992
01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.450
<v Speaker 4>It's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely unique circumstance and um,</v>

1993
01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I mean it's true that you went to </v>

1994
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 4>read the New York Times for the longest </v>
<v Speaker 4>time it was,</v>

1995
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 4>it was reading like just the thing had </v>
<v Speaker 4>become</v>

1996
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.730
<v Speaker 5>the opinion page on the Huffington post </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>

1997
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like at this stage of our,</v>

1998
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:08.590
<v Speaker 5>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's real consequences to the infant </v>

1999
01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:12.390
<v Speaker 5>tylenol if that's actually a word of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of human beings in our culture.</v>

2000
01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:17.391
<v Speaker 5>We've made it very easy to just go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>work and just get home and watch </v>

2001
01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:22.971
<v Speaker 5>television and just not pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything and not read anything and not </v>

2002
01:38:22.971 --> 01:38:25.140
<v Speaker 5>really think and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then be manipulated.</v>

2003
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:30.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's incredibly easy to </v>

2004
01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:32.871
<v Speaker 5>manipulate people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially people that are aware that </v>

2005
01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:35.811
<v Speaker 5>they don't have a varied media diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that are aware that they don't </v>

2006
01:38:35.811 --> 01:38:39.951
<v Speaker 5>have a real sense of the word and there </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems daunting to try to take into </v>

2007
01:38:39.951 --> 01:38:41.850
<v Speaker 5>consideration like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is involved in foreign policy,</v>

2008
01:38:41.851 --> 01:38:45.000
<v Speaker 5>what is involved in dealing with Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is involved?</v>

2009
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:47.460
<v Speaker 5>How do you negotiate with North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

2010
01:38:47.461 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 5>it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put it in the hands of the strong man.</v>

2011
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:54.790
<v Speaker 3>This is true on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum though because I think we've </v>

2012
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:55.640
<v Speaker 3>got folks um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2013
01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.940
<v Speaker 3>who slot into just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2014
01:38:59.030 --> 01:39:02.390
<v Speaker 3>a media diet where they're just hearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on the left and they're not,</v>

2015
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:06.260
<v Speaker 3>they're not curious about or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2016
01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess just just not curious enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear things from a different perspective</v>

2017
01:39:11.271 --> 01:39:16.271
<v Speaker 3>unless it's just some right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>political who comes on and they beat </v>

2018
01:39:16.271 --> 01:39:16.271
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2019
01:39:16.271 --> 01:39:16.271
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2020
01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:21.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do think and I think it put </v>

2021
01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.290
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is going to be a self serving </v>

2022
01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:25.811
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think it places increasing </v>

2023
01:39:25.811 --> 01:39:28.540
<v Speaker 3>important sun media outlets like the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>for which I work to be really vigilant </v>

2024
01:39:29.211 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 3>about being seen as fair arbiters or </v>
<v Speaker 3>fax.</v>

2025
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the consequences have never been</v>

2026
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:35.370
<v Speaker 5>greater for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2027
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:38.550
<v Speaker 5>The reason that so many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2028
01:39:38.551 --> 01:39:40.520
<v Speaker 5>somebody trump's support supporters </v>
<v Speaker 5>fear,</v>

2029
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:45.590
<v Speaker 5>feel like they're right is because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>has been proven that the media was </v>

2030
01:39:46.711 --> 01:39:51.711
<v Speaker 5>biased and that they did get it all </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong and they were absolutely wrong </v>

2031
01:39:51.711 --> 01:39:55.011
<v Speaker 5>when it came to who was going win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The huffington post has some ridiculous </v>

2032
01:39:55.011 --> 01:39:58.431
<v Speaker 5>thing where it was the night of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>election and they said that Hillary had </v>

2033
01:39:58.431 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 5>like a 98 percent chance of winning or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something crazy like that.</v>

2034
01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there were some polls that were </v>

2035
01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:05.190
<v Speaker 5>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the pole like the,</v>

2036
01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:09.260
<v Speaker 5>because I remember this because I sent </v>
<v Speaker 5>out a tweet which said like by,</v>

2037
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.470
<v Speaker 5>by Donald or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day of.</v>

2038
01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.840
<v Speaker 5>But when I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that wasn't a prediction and the,</v>

2039
01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the polls that I was going by that most </v>

2040
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:21.270
<v Speaker 5>people were going by that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like 80 slash 20,</v>

2041
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:26.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or at best 75 slash 25 that she was </v>

2042
01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:26.290
<v Speaker 5>going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that's not.</v>

2043
01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you roll dice for a few minutes,</v>

2044
01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 5>you realize 20 percent chance comes up a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot,</v>

2045
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.220
<v Speaker 5>so I guess that's infinite test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Melodic plus Florida.</v>

2046
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2047
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:36.690
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2048
01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.420
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2049
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.440
<v Speaker 5>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should tell the story about what it </v>

2050
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:42.440
<v Speaker 5>was like to anchor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2051
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:42.440
<v Speaker 3>well I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.960
<v Speaker 3>So I was anchoring the ABC News digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>coverage that night.</v>

2053
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2054
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:46.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2055
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.800
<v Speaker 3>they give you the exit polling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're not supposed to report it </v>

2056
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:52.660
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the exit polling that we were seeing</v>

2057
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.920
<v Speaker 3>before we went on the air late in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day really made it seem like it's going </v>

2058
01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.721
<v Speaker 3>to be a Clinton landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you have all these folks who </v>

2059
01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:03.631
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the crest fallen faces of the </v>

2060
01:41:03.631 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 3>journalists because they're so upset </v>
<v Speaker 3>that trump won.</v>

2061
01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Certainly that was not the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks on my set was that it was,</v>

2062
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:11.220
<v Speaker 3>that we didn't see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't prepared for it.</v>

2063
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Everything that we're seeing in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the math made it look like this was a </v>

2064
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Clinton victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A shoe in.</v>

2065
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 3>It was just about just tying a ribbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>

2066
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:23.910
<v Speaker 3>So when the night became long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was just confusion about what was </v>

2067
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:25.090
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they get it so wrong.</v>

2068
01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it actually goes back to what </v>

2069
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.931
<v Speaker 3>Sam was saying before that people think </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see numbers like 70 percent is </v>

2070
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:37.800
<v Speaker 3>that Clinton's going to win 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>odds that Clinton's going to win that,</v>

2071
01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.120
<v Speaker 3>that she's definitely going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's room there for trump to a </v>

2072
01:41:45.011 --> 01:41:46.160
<v Speaker 3>lot of room there for whatever</v>

2073
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:50.530
<v Speaker 5>present comes up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's Russian roulette bills or bad.</v>

2074
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:52.090
<v Speaker 5>If it's Russian roulette,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are bad odds.</v>

2075
01:41:52.091 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to take that one single</v>

2076
01:41:55.031 --> 01:41:56.040
<v Speaker 5>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2077
01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2078
01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.170
<v Speaker 5>you're a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 5>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

2080
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much about blaming the polls as </v>

2081
01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.630
<v Speaker 3>it was blaming the overall tenor of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coverage,</v>

2082
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 3>which made it seem like Clinton was </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable.</v>

2083
01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:42:11.141 --> 01:42:12.090
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2085
01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.230
<v Speaker 3>It was so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hit.</v>

2086
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we,</v>

2087
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.200
<v Speaker 3>we can and should take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2088
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.390
<v Speaker 3>we definitely know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we,</v>

2089
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:24.420
<v Speaker 3>we weren't giving the 20 or 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance a serious enough look.</v>

2090
01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:27.930
<v Speaker 5>What is your thought as being someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who covers these things?</v>

2091
01:42:27.931 --> 01:42:30.660
<v Speaker 5>What is your thought about the electoral</v>
<v Speaker 5>college?</v>

2092
01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that that's an antiquated </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea and then,</v>

2093
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of established back when you</v>

2094
01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:40.401
<v Speaker 5>really needed a representative because </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you would have to get on a </v>

2095
01:42:40.401 --> 01:42:41.520
<v Speaker 5>fucking horse and ride into Washington </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it would take six months.</v>

2096
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.800
<v Speaker 3>I can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make very powerful arguments </v>

2097
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.130
<v Speaker 3>that it's deeply problematic </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>

2098
01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see the power of those arguments </v>

2099
01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:53.160
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2100
01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.050
<v Speaker 3>there are people who argue make similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments about the United States </v>

2101
01:42:58.050 --> 01:42:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2103
01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:00.340
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2104
01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.400
<v Speaker 3>there was a piece that ran in the New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York Times,</v>

2105
01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:08.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their Sunday we can review not long </v>

2106
01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:11.971
<v Speaker 3>after the election making the case that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the angriest people in America actually </v>

2107
01:43:11.971 --> 01:43:14.970
<v Speaker 3>should be those live on the coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's taxation without </v>

2108
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:17.941
<v Speaker 3>representation that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the people who live on the coast </v>

2109
01:43:17.941 --> 01:43:21.301
<v Speaker 3>are paying more in taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have less representation </v>

2110
01:43:21.301 --> 01:43:21.930
<v Speaker 3>actually in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2111
01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:23.290
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2112
01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not research that I've done,</v>

2113
01:43:25.061 --> 01:43:26.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's an interesting idea.</v>

2114
01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen anybody present any </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of a logical argument that there </v>

2115
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:36.131
<v Speaker 5>really shouldn't be a president anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the idea of having one alpha champ </v>

2116
01:43:36.131 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 5>run this whole thing seems pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>outdated and just not sure that he runs </v>

2117
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:42.020
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's got a lot of info.</v>

2118
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:43.600
<v Speaker 3>It's an enormous amount of influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2119
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:48.830
<v Speaker 3>but we're seeing Donald Trump is seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now the limits of presidential </v>

2120
01:43:49.171 --> 01:43:51.350
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't get his,</v>

2121
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:53.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the healthcare bill that they,</v>

2122
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:57.980
<v Speaker 3>that didn't even make it wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to what he promised on the,</v>

2123
01:43:57.990 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 3>or in some ways wasn't even close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he promised in the campaign trail.</v>

2124
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.760
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't get the bill that he wanted </v>

2125
01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.210
<v Speaker 3>and then he couldn't get that passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now he's looking at having to watch </v>

2126
01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:12.660
<v Speaker 3>his party employed the nuclear option in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to get a,</v>

2127
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:16.470
<v Speaker 3>his supreme court nominee a seated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2128
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the founders designed in </v>

2129
01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.171
<v Speaker 3>many ways a really ingenious system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we put a lot of attention on the </v>

2130
01:44:26.171 --> 01:44:30.011
<v Speaker 3>president because it's one person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>get who's in our on our TV screens or </v>

2131
01:44:30.011 --> 01:44:34.841
<v Speaker 3>our phones all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure how much power is </v>

2132
01:44:34.841 --> 01:44:35.600
<v Speaker 3>vested in that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when it comes to foreign policy,</v>

2133
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:37.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a different kettle of fish.</v>

2134
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's enough that the EPA has been sort </v>

2135
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:46.161
<v Speaker 5>of hobbled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean what they've done with the </v>

2136
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:46.161
<v Speaker 5>environmental protection agency </v>
<v Speaker 5>standards,</v>

2137
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:50.100
<v Speaker 5>especially when it regards to emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's rolled back emission standards.</v>

2138
01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:52.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's anything that we should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be concerned about.</v>

2139
01:44:52.201 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 5>It's the air that we breathe and we are </v>
<v Speaker 5>moving in a direction we.</v>

2140
01:44:56.361 --> 01:45:01.361
<v Speaker 5>We're clearly moving in a direction to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get away from things like coal and he's </v>

2141
01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.400
<v Speaker 5>going the opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

2142
01:45:02.401 --> 01:45:07.401
<v Speaker 5>but what I've heard is that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>even going to be effective because most </v>

2143
01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:13.101
<v Speaker 5>places have moved away from coal to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>point where restarting coal production </v>

2144
01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:18.540
<v Speaker 5>is not even gonna recharge the economy </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the way that would make it a viable </v>

2145
01:45:19.441 --> 01:45:20.520
<v Speaker 5>option in the first place.</v>

2146
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:23.350
<v Speaker 3>The issue of climate change is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2147
01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll say as a member of the media and </v>
<v Speaker 3>area where I feel,</v>

2148
01:45:27.610 --> 01:45:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm just speaking for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really one of our biggest failures,</v>

2149
01:45:32.170 --> 01:45:34.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think history is going to go</v>

2150
01:45:34.381 --> 01:45:37.950
<v Speaker 3>just kindly and I get off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put the blame on myself.</v>

2151
01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It's become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard story to get people just </v>

2152
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.710
<v Speaker 3>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2153
01:45:44.190 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 3>and especially for television because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of sort of graphs and </v>

2154
01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:49.270
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2155
01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:54.500
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only so many pictures of polar </v>

2156
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:54.500
<v Speaker 3>bears you can show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2157
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 3>and so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I anguish about that because I do think </v>

2158
01:45:59.600 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2159
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't a debate.</v>

2160
01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Climate change is real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost certainly caused by humans.</v>

2161
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for too long we fell for that in the</v>

2162
01:46:09.781 --> 01:46:13.160
<v Speaker 3>media where we presented it as a debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it wasn't a.</v>

2163
01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Now I think we're past that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still don't think we're covering </v>

2164
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:18.380
<v Speaker 3>it enough and as robustly as we should.</v>

2165
01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.010
<v Speaker 5>Climate change I think is very sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost abstract to people.</v>

2166
01:46:23.011 --> 01:46:25.170
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult for them to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 5>their head around,</v>

2167
01:46:25.171 --> 01:46:29.310
<v Speaker 5>especially when they look at the ice </v>
<v Speaker 5>core samples and there's plenty of stuff</v>

2168
01:46:29.311 --> 01:46:34.311
<v Speaker 5>online where you could sort of convince </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself that there's always been this </v>

2169
01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:36.180
<v Speaker 5>rise and fall of the temperature on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

2170
01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:40.590
<v Speaker 5>In many ways that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but pollution is another thing.</v>

2171
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.800
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think actually I just walked in so I </v>

2172
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.131
<v Speaker 5>might have missed what you said there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's a crucial shift of </v>

2173
01:46:49.131 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 5>emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no</v>

2174
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.020
<v Speaker 4>argument about air pollution runs </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>

2175
01:46:55.021 --> 01:47:00.021
<v Speaker 4>It's undesirability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like you don't want particulates </v>

2176
01:47:00.021 --> 01:47:01.650
<v Speaker 4>in your lungs that you don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have there.</v>

2177
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.680
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that we could see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could completely justify a green </v>

2178
01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:11.721
<v Speaker 4>economy on that basis alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it just imagine if we had no </v>

2179
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:16.440
<v Speaker 4>pollution coming from the exhaust of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cars out there and there was no coal</v>

2180
01:47:16.441 --> 01:47:21.441
<v Speaker 4>fired power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just had solar and wind and and you </v>

2181
01:47:21.441 --> 01:47:25.391
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>safe nuclear technology powering the </v>

2182
01:47:25.391 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 4>grid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be fantastic from just a pure.</v>

2183
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean forget about the health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just taught me the,</v>

2184
01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:32.740
<v Speaker 4>obviously cancers is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a lung cancer and,</v>

2185
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 4>and cardiovascular diseases is a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue there.</v>

2186
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 4>But just aesthetically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so desirable.</v>

2187
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:45.621
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no argument against it and </v>

2188
01:47:45.621 --> 01:47:47.470
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like people don't make that </v>

2189
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.470
<v Speaker 4>connection</v>

2190
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:48.590
<v Speaker 3>because climate change is slow moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2191
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.160
<v Speaker 3>and it could be way out in the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>before pollution isn't.</v>

2192
01:47:52.161 --> 01:47:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2193
01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.780
<v Speaker 3>but it pollution is a much less </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial than climate change.</v>

2194
01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why this coal thing,</v>

2195
01:47:58.191 --> 01:48:02.480
<v Speaker 3>so disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reigniting this production of coal.</v>

2196
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievable.</v>

2197
01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.790
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2198
01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I guess I have questions about whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even going to happen.</v>

2199
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:10.310
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can roll it back.</v>

2200
01:48:11.150 --> 01:48:14.120
<v Speaker 3>But the coal industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are many,</v>

2201
01:48:14.150 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2202
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:20.300
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are many factors to their decision </v>

2203
01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:20.300
<v Speaker 3>making about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2204
01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.440
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they go and do the mining is,</v>

2205
01:48:21.710 --> 01:48:23.200
<v Speaker 3>is what they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2206
01:48:23.201 --> 01:48:26.000
<v Speaker 3>a mine going to actually even be </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed.</v>

2207
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.830
<v Speaker 3>So I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2208
01:48:27.831 --> 01:48:32.831
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that even though they're doing </v>

2209
01:48:32.831 --> 01:48:32.831
<v Speaker 3>some pretty radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making some pretty radical noises at the</v>

2210
01:48:32.831 --> 01:48:35.780
<v Speaker 3>EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how far pruitt can,</v>

2211
01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:41.020
<v Speaker 3>can take some of this stuff given the </v>
<v Speaker 3>existing body of law case law that has </v>

2212
01:48:41.331 --> 01:48:45.680
<v Speaker 3>formed around a Obama's decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it gets,</v>

2213
01:48:45.681 --> 01:48:49.250
<v Speaker 3>it gets pretty more complicated the </v>
<v Speaker 3>closer you look at it,</v>

2214
01:48:49.251 --> 01:48:52.970
<v Speaker 3>from what I can tell and I won't claim </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have studied it too too closely,</v>

2215
01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.410
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to get more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you look at it,</v>

2216
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:59.090
<v Speaker 3>the headlines maybe scarier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess is my point.</v>

2217
01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's pretty clear though is emission </v>

2218
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:04.300
<v Speaker 3>standards rolling</v>

2219
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:07.040
<v Speaker 5>back emission standard sends a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>clear message that it's okay to pollute </v>

2220
01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:07.040
<v Speaker 5>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2221
01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.570
<v Speaker 5>we were moving in a direction of going </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards electric cars,</v>

2222
01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 5>going towards cars that pollute the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment less.</v>

2223
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean even cars that use gas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2224
01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:21.230
<v Speaker 5>for a Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 5>porsche has a nine slash 11 turbo and </v>

2225
01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 5>the standards of emissions are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong.</v>

2226
01:49:22.801 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 5>What they've developed as a car that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>drive it through La,</v>

2227
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 5>the exhaust that comes out is cleaner </v>
<v Speaker 5>than the air.</v>

2228
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:29.280
<v Speaker 5>It sucks in.</v>

2229
01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2230
01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:34.060
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that you're driving through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an air filter.</v>

2231
01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:35.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is bad air filter.</v>

2232
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.070
<v Speaker 5>It can be done very expensive hair </v>
<v Speaker 5>filming.</v>

2233
01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.640
<v Speaker 5>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's.</v>

2234
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we can move further and further </v>

2235
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.341
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously the problem with that </v>

2236
01:49:47.341 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 5>is it's taking in polluted air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the issue in the first place.</v>

2237
01:49:47.801 --> 01:49:50.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to breathe the exhaust of</v>

2238
01:49:50.021 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 5>a Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what they've done is managed to make</v>

2239
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:59.071
<v Speaker 5>something so efficient that it actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>does emit clean air coming out of it or </v>

2240
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:02.080
<v Speaker 5>cleaner than the polluted air that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>sucking in.</v>

2241
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if these environmental protection agency</v>

2242
01:50:05.081 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 5>standards keep getting rolled back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're going to go back to.</v>

2243
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't know how far the rolling </v>
<v Speaker 5>it back,</v>

2244
01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:16.471
<v Speaker 5>but what you said is so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing good about polluting the</v>

2245
01:50:17.381 --> 01:50:22.381
<v Speaker 5>air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's what we need to breathe and </v>

2246
01:50:22.381 --> 01:50:24.781
<v Speaker 5>there's options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that business should take </v>

2247
01:50:24.781 --> 01:50:26.980
<v Speaker 5>precedent over the actual environment </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we need to sustain ourselves.</v>

2248
01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:32.100
<v Speaker 3>So let's not forget there are a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings in coal country who have </v>

2249
01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 3>generations of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done,</v>

2250
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:35.860
<v Speaker 3>have spent generations working in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

2251
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:41.190
<v Speaker 3>take great pride in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've got to think about what we do.</v>

2252
01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.860
<v Speaker 4>It's only the numbers here as uprising </v>
<v Speaker 4>and also little reported.</v>

2253
01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:52.370
<v Speaker 4>It's only 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>coal jobs we're talking about in the </v>

2254
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:54.800
<v Speaker 4>country and there's something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>500,000</v>

2255
01:50:54.801 --> 01:50:57.690
<v Speaker 4>clean tech jobs just in California </v>
<v Speaker 4>alone.</v>

2256
01:50:57.691 --> 01:50:59.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers are completely out of it.</v>

2257
01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2258
01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I think the cleantech to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2259
01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>industry offers an enormous amount of </v>

2260
01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 75,000</v>

2261
01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:07.620
<v Speaker 3>families is not nothing.</v>

2262
01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:09.600
<v Speaker 4>And when we're talking about and give </v>
<v Speaker 4>them money,</v>

2263
01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:14.640
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to end up going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This goes to the question of meaning and</v>

2264
01:51:14.641 --> 01:51:16.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what are we going to do?</v>

2265
01:51:16.021 --> 01:51:20.400
<v Speaker 4>Because we're on the precipice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting to is everyone.</v>

2266
01:51:20.401 --> 01:51:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Virtually everyone is going to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>position of these coal miners.</v>

2267
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:28.430
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were talking about and that </v>

2268
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.430
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>

2269
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2270
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:33.370
<v Speaker 4>that's why can't they figure out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they just want to learn new languages </v>

2271
01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:34.380
<v Speaker 4>and spend more time with their kids and </v>
<v Speaker 4>play Frisbee and,</v>

2272
01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:36.810
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have fun.</v>

2273
01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:42.140
<v Speaker 4>We need a new ethic that and politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>that decouples a person's claim on </v>

2274
01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.860
<v Speaker 4>existence from doing profitable work </v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone will pay you for.</v>

2275
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:51.170
<v Speaker 4>It says a lot of that work is going on.</v>

2276
01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:51.950
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2277
01:51:51.951 --> 01:51:56.951
<v Speaker 3>we could view it as an opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is actually something that it does </v>

2278
01:51:56.951 --> 01:51:59.480
<v Speaker 3>dovetail with this hobby horse that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have been on for awhile about,</v>

2279
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2280
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:06.010
<v Speaker 3>kind of about the power of meditation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it can do to a human mind and </v>

2281
01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:07.640
<v Speaker 3>the way you view the world and your role</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

2282
01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:08.180
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

2283
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:10.700
<v Speaker 5>What are you thoughts on universal basic</v>
<v Speaker 5>income?</v>

2284
01:52:10.701 --> 01:52:15.701
<v Speaker 5>Because bring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring it back to that with this rise of </v>

2285
01:52:15.701 --> 01:52:15.701
<v Speaker 5>the machines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we do have things automated,</v>

2286
01:52:15.701 --> 01:52:20.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean some ridiculous number of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>make their living driving cars and </v>

2287
01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:22.280
<v Speaker 5>driving trucks now when that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when those jobs are gone,</v>

2288
01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 5>I think it's millions of people.</v>

2289
01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.710
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is in the states,</v>

2290
01:52:26.711 --> 01:52:31.711
<v Speaker 4>it's the most common job for white men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think something like 9 million white </v>

2291
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:38.920
<v Speaker 4>men are driving trucks and cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the problem with that is most people</v>

2292
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:41.410
<v Speaker 4>like fuck white men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white men,</v>

2293
01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.890
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is trump's.</v>

2294
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2295
01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 4>it's these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2296
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I think universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There,</v>

2297
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 4>there reasons to worry that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect solution because you do want,</v>

2298
01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:59.320
<v Speaker 4>you want to incentivize the things you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to incentivize you to.</v>

2299
01:52:59.321 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 4>You need to just understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of,</v>

2300
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.480
<v Speaker 4>of any system you would put in place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's just no question that in the</v>

2301
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:11.040
<v Speaker 4>viewed as an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2302
01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 4>this is the greatest opportunity in </v>
<v Speaker 4>human history.</v>

2303
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:18.941
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about canceling the need </v>
<v Speaker 4>for dangerous,</v>

2304
01:53:19.341 --> 01:53:24.341
<v Speaker 4>boring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repetitive work and freeing up humanity </v>

2305
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:28.220
<v Speaker 4>to do interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative,</v>

2306
01:53:28.221 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 4>fun things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2307
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:30.800
<v Speaker 4>how could that be bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2308
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.680
<v Speaker 4>give us a little time and we'll show you</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we can make it bad,</v>

2309
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:38.710
<v Speaker 4>but it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be bad if it leads to just </v>

2310
01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary wealth inequality that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

2311
01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 4>We don't have the political or ethical </v>
<v Speaker 4>will to,</v>

2312
01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:49.110
<v Speaker 4>to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because if we have a culture of </v>

2313
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:53.141
<v Speaker 4>people who think I don't want any </v>
<v Speaker 4>handouts and I certainly don't want my </v>

2314
01:53:53.141 --> 01:53:54.160
<v Speaker 4>neighbor to get any handouts and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to pay any taxes so that he gets,</v>

2315
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 4>he can be a lazy bum if that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we have this,</v>

2316
01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:59.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hangover from,</v>

2317
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:00.290
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2318
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:01.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calvinism,</v>

2319
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:06.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes it impossible to talk </v>

2320
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 4>creatively and reasonably about what has</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

2321
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:15.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it could be a very painful </v>

2322
01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:15.860
<v Speaker 4>bottleneck we have to pass through until</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get to something that is,</v>

2323
01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.310
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2324
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:20.660
<v Speaker 4>much better or a hell of a lot worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on,</v>

2325
01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:24.030
<v Speaker 4>on where the technology goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think at a certain point the,</v>

2326
01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:28.340
<v Speaker 4>the wealth inequality will be obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsustainable.</v>

2327
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:33.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't have multiple trillionaires </v>

2328
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:35.860
<v Speaker 4>walking around living in compounds with </v>
<v Speaker 4>razor wire and just moving everywhere by</v>

2329
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 4>private jet.</v>

2330
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

2331
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:46.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive levels of unemployment in a </v>

2332
01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:46.960
<v Speaker 4>society like ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2333
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.120
<v Speaker 4>at a certain point where the richest </v>
<v Speaker 4>people will realize that enough is </v>

2334
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:58.421
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to spread this wealth because </v>

2335
01:54:58.421 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 4>otherwise people are just going to show </v>
<v Speaker 4>up at our compounds with,</v>

2336
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 4>with their ar fifteens or their </v>
<v Speaker 4>pitchforks and you know,</v>

2337
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:08.380
<v Speaker 4>that the society will not sustain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean you can't use the,</v>

2338
01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>there has to be some level of wealth </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality that is unsustainable that </v>

2339
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will not tolerate.</v>

2340
01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you begin to look more and more like</v>

2341
01:55:17.001 --> 01:55:20.150
<v Speaker 4>a banana republic until you become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>banana republic.</v>

2342
01:55:20.151 --> 01:55:22.580
<v Speaker 4>But now we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2343
01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 4>the US or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the developed world where all the </v>

2344
01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.790
<v Speaker 4>wealth is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So redistribution is the end game.</v>

2345
01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:37.020
<v Speaker 4>We and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a toxic concept for half of </v>

2346
01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:40.720
<v Speaker 4>the country right now where the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the welfare state in perpetuating that </v>

2347
01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.840
<v Speaker 4>and spreading it across the board.</v>

2348
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these are so,</v>

2349
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:45.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2350
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 4>whatever the solution is for coal </v>
<v Speaker 4>mining,</v>

2351
01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 4>we should not be hostage for the coal </v>
<v Speaker 4>miners.</v>

2352
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.900
<v Speaker 4>We should not be hostage to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they need jobs so that whatever job</v>

2353
01:55:59.221 --> 01:56:04.221
<v Speaker 4>they were doing and are still qualified </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do that job has to continue to exist </v>

2354
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:09.890
<v Speaker 4>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what the environmental </v>

2355
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:10.470
<v Speaker 4>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what the health consequences,</v>

2356
01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:13.320
<v Speaker 4>no matter well how it closes the door to</v>
<v Speaker 4>good things that we,</v>

2357
01:56:13.321 --> 01:56:16.020
<v Speaker 4>we want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't do that with any that we didn't</v>

2358
01:56:16.021 --> 01:56:19.170
<v Speaker 4>do that with the people who are making </v>
<v Speaker 4>buggy whips or,</v>

2359
01:56:19.171 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 4>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slavery.</v>

2360
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or Yeah.</v>

2361
01:56:21.721 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

2362
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm at a certain point we move on and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>make progress and we don't let that </v>

2363
01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:34.401
<v Speaker 4>progress get rolled back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're talking about a </v>

2364
01:56:34.401 --> 01:56:38.030
<v Speaker 4>developing technology that produces </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy that doesn't have any of these </v>

2365
01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.500
<v Speaker 4>negative effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2366
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's global climate change or </v>

2367
01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:49.671
<v Speaker 4>just pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course we have to move in that </v>

2368
01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:49.671
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

2369
01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:52.910
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that's crazy is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking honestly about how the</v>

2370
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.980
<v Speaker 4>dirty tech is subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2371
01:56:55.981 --> 01:56:57.840
<v Speaker 4>you have the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People say,</v>

2372
01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:00.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>solar is all subsidized,</v>

2373
01:57:00.451 --> 01:57:01.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2374
01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.980
<v Speaker 4>is this a government handout that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>given us the solar industry?</v>

2375
01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2376
01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:10.821
<v Speaker 4>that's not even that you have to produce</v>
<v Speaker 4>an argument as to why that's a bad </v>

2377
01:57:10.821 --> 01:57:10.821
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2378
01:57:10.821 --> 01:57:11.220
<v Speaker 4>this is something we should want the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government to do.</v>

2379
01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:16.221
<v Speaker 4>The government needs to incentivize new </v>
<v Speaker 4>industries that the market can't </v>

2380
01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:17.790
<v Speaker 4>incentivize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2381
01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 4>if there are industries that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsically good and are going to lead</v>

2382
01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:26.451
<v Speaker 4>to the betterment of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but carbon is massively subsidized.</v>

2383
01:57:27.361 --> 01:57:28.380
<v Speaker 4>We Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have,</v>

2384
01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we actually had the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2385
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:34.490
<v Speaker 4>the coal producers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2386
01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:39.880
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the petroleum producers pay for the </v>

2387
01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.850
<v Speaker 4>consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of carbon and pollution.</v>

2388
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.200
<v Speaker 4>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be much more expensive than it </v>

2389
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:47.200
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2390
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:47.200
<v Speaker 4>So it's already subsidized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2391
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:47.340
<v Speaker 4>we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we should,</v>

2392
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:48.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2393
01:57:48.351 --> 01:57:49.770
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need a carbon tax.</v>

2394
01:57:49.771 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Clearly we need to the tax code to </v>
<v Speaker 4>incentivize what we want to incentivize.</v>

2395
01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton of industries in this </v>

2396
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.450
<v Speaker 4>country that you could make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument for.</v>

2397
01:57:59.450 --> 01:58:02.840
<v Speaker 4>The corn industry is one subsidizing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>corn industry and when you find out the </v>

2398
01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.231
<v Speaker 4>corn and corn syrup is responsible for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a huge epidemic of obesity in </v>

2399
01:58:08.551 --> 01:58:13.551
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the amount of corn syrup that's in </v>

2400
01:58:13.551 --> 01:58:13.551
<v Speaker 4>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have USA,</v>

2401
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:18.950
<v Speaker 4>USA polluter had to pay the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consequences of your pollution all </v>

2402
01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:20.940
<v Speaker 4>the way down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2403
01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to compensate everyone who got </v>

2404
01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.030
<v Speaker 4>emphysema or lung cancer because of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were putting into the air,</v>

2405
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 4>your industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be less profitable,</v>

2406
01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:38.420
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it might not be profitable at all </v>

2407
01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:38.420
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we don't have,</v>

2408
01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 4>we haven't priced all of that in to any </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things,</v>

2409
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 4>whether you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2410
01:58:42.311 --> 01:58:43.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chemical industry or,</v>

2411
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the industry.</v>

2412
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2413
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're addicted to the use of these </v>

2414
01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:53.340
<v Speaker 4>fossil fuels the same way we're addicted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some people are addicted to the use </v>

2415
01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:55.330
<v Speaker 4>of cigarettes when the health </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of those things are there,</v>

2416
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 4>they're almost parallel and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2417
01:58:57.150 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well and amazingly,</v>

2418
01:58:58.751 --> 01:59:00.180
<v Speaker 4>as you have the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2419
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I think you turned me onto this </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary.</v>

2420
01:59:03.851 --> 01:59:08.851
<v Speaker 4>What was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>merchants of doubt that the same phds </v>

2421
01:59:08.851 --> 01:59:09.940
<v Speaker 4>you got like 10 guys who moved from </v>
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

2422
01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:14.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just toxic industry to toxic industry </v>

2423
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:15.620
<v Speaker 4>defending whether it's big tobacco or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

2424
01:59:17.090 --> 01:59:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the document a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed a guy named Fred Singer </v>

2425
01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:24.900
<v Speaker 3>who was one of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2426
01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.270
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a climate change denier and there's</v>

2427
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:30.700
<v Speaker 3>just some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2428
01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:35.980
<v Speaker 3>it's been awhile that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some key moments where I was </v>

2429
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:36.290
<v Speaker 3>like listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening for him,</v>

2430
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:41.180
<v Speaker 3>all the major scientific organizations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that say that climate change is real and</v>

2431
01:59:41.181 --> 01:59:46.181
<v Speaker 3>that humans are our major contributors </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it and he basically just refused to </v>

2432
01:59:46.181 --> 01:59:46.370
<v Speaker 3>accept it.</v>

2433
01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Those shows where you have the three </v>
<v Speaker 4>heads,</v>

2434
01:59:49.721 --> 01:59:52.920
<v Speaker 4>you and then the two experts and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>yell over each other and then we'll,</v>

2435
01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 4>we'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you go to commercial fucking </v>

2436
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.361
<v Speaker 4>things on solving anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those weird moments where people are </v>

2437
02:00:00.361 --> 02:00:02.710
<v Speaker 4>yelling at each other and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out who's right or who's wrong.</v>

2438
02:00:02.970 --> 02:00:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of that personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that especially it was a </v>

2439
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:09.980
<v Speaker 3>failure to do that with climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>

2440
02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it created the doubt,</v>

2441
02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:13.900
<v Speaker 3>it created the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2442
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:19.070
<v Speaker 3>and I think that was a very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very successful strategy.</v>

2443
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:22.140
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's intention intention with what</v>

2444
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:25.530
<v Speaker 4>we just said about the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you,</v>

2445
02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:27.840
<v Speaker 4>if you take a position as a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you say,</v>

2446
02:00:27.841 --> 02:00:32.841
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually one side of this conversation </v>

2447
02:00:32.841 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 4>is full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you seem like you're not an</v>

2448
02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.890
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's different to take us a,</v>

2449
02:00:36.010 --> 02:00:37.180
<v Speaker 3>a position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2450
02:00:37.450 --> 02:00:39.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not controversial for me to sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and say,</v>

2451
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:40.970
<v Speaker 3>if you smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2452
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.490
<v Speaker 3>the science strongly suggest you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher odds of lung cancer.</v>

2453
02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it became politicized.</v>

2454
02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:50.410
<v Speaker 3>So I don't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2455
02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:56.010
<v Speaker 3>you'll notice I've stepped out of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the discussions that have been taking</v>

2456
02:00:56.170 --> 02:01:01.170
<v Speaker 3>place because it's not my role as </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists to come down on one side or </v>

2457
02:01:01.170 --> 02:01:01.170
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with climate change,</v>

2458
02:01:01.170 --> 02:01:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I feel absolutely comfortable saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2459
02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.110
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2460
02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:09.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of scientists believe </v>

2461
02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 3>this is real and a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big problem.</v>

2462
02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:15.240
<v Speaker 3>So I don't what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about with the New </v>

2463
02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:18.720
<v Speaker 3>York Times and I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to step out and take a </v>

2464
02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:18.720
<v Speaker 3>view on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

2465
02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.230
<v Speaker 3>what I believe you're saying with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>times is that they were pro Clinton and </v>

2466
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:26.101
<v Speaker 3>anti trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different from having a position </v>

2467
02:01:26.101 --> 02:01:26.101
<v Speaker 3>on climate change.</v>

2468
02:01:26.101 --> 02:01:26.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2469
02:01:26.101 --> 02:01:31.091
<v Speaker 4>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they have a position on just </v>

2470
02:01:31.091 --> 02:01:33.610
<v Speaker 4>just take the Lens as climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have one candidate who's denying the</v>

2471
02:01:34.431 --> 02:01:35.540
<v Speaker 4>reality of climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where?</v>

2472
02:01:35.541 --> 02:01:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just claiming that the,</v>

2473
02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2474
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:42.580
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was.</v>

2475
02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Because when trump says climate change </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a Chinese hoax,</v>

2476
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 4>you have to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

2477
02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.840
<v Speaker 4>He said it's a Chinese hoax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he should go to China and see those </v>

2478
02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.541
<v Speaker 4>people that are walking around with gas </v>
<v Speaker 4>masks on because they can't breathe in </v>

2479
02:01:58.541 --> 02:01:58.541
<v Speaker 4>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2480
02:01:58.541 --> 02:01:58.541
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2481
02:01:58.541 --> 02:01:59.200
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the pollution argument,</v>

2482
02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:04.220
<v Speaker 4>which I think is actually much stronger </v>
<v Speaker 4>because just you can't go to Beijing and</v>

2483
02:02:04.281 --> 02:02:06.020
<v Speaker 4>say this is how we want the air to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2484
02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think something like 20,</v>

2485
02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:15.251
<v Speaker 4>I think something like 25 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>air pollution in California on some days</v>

2486
02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:17.870
<v Speaker 4>is coming from China.</v>

2487
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's some amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have that slightly wrong.</v>

2488
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Jamie can check that out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but please do.</v>

2489
02:02:22.251 --> 02:02:24.160
<v Speaker 4>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some extraordinary amount of air</v>

2490
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 4>air pollution that we get from China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2491
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I did not know that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just makes its way across the ocean.</v>

2492
02:02:31.810 --> 02:02:35.850
<v Speaker 4>There's no wall build that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2493
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:37.970
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at a certain point,</v>

2494
02:02:37.971 --> 02:02:42.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some level of dishonesty and </v>

2495
02:02:42.971 --> 02:02:43.760
<v Speaker 4>misinformation that's so egregious that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a journalist,</v>

2496
02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.120
<v Speaker 4>commit at all committed to being an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbiased or disinterested broker of </v>

2497
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:53.420
<v Speaker 4>information and a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you set up a conversation between,</v>

2498
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:56.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Sean Spicer's of the world or,</v>

2499
02:02:56.091 --> 02:03:01.091
<v Speaker 4>or the Kellyanne Conway's who have their</v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative facts and someone who's </v>

2500
02:03:01.091 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 4>honestly talking about whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climate change,</v>

2501
02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:07.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

2502
02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't split that baby,</v>

2503
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:14.200
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you have to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>mock unnecessary debates around climate </v>

2504
02:03:14.751 --> 02:03:16.250
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I do think is that,</v>

2505
02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:19.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the trump administration,</v>

2506
02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:24.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is imperative for journal that </v>

2507
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:25.510
<v Speaker 3>journalists a call out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2508
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>when things are said that aren't true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that I don't think it's constructive</v>

2509
02:03:29.601 --> 02:03:34.601
<v Speaker 3>for mainstream journalistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations to have an openly hostile </v>

2510
02:03:34.601 --> 02:03:39.320
<v Speaker 3>anti trump attitude or pro somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude because then you lead.</v>

2511
02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.680
<v Speaker 3>That just leads to further polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when it's exactly what we don't </v>

2512
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:44.680
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>

2513
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:48.660
<v Speaker 4>but you call him out on all the times </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he said things that were just </v>

2514
02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:48.660
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2515
02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:49.290
<v Speaker 4>It was like you're anti trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes it can.</v>

2516
02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.060
<v Speaker 3>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no question.</v>

2517
02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:54.170
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a issue we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with and I,</v>

2518
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:59.200
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is a time of real soul </v>
<v Speaker 3>searching in my industry because I,</v>

2519
02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe there is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful place in a functioning </v>

2520
02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.140
<v Speaker 3>democracy for a press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2521
02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:10.620
<v Speaker 3>for media that people generally view as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair.</v>

2522
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also really highlights the </v>

2523
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:17.831
<v Speaker 4>responsibility of getting accurate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbiased information to people because </v>

2524
02:04:17.831 --> 02:04:19.570
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of sources of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

2525
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Mean when you look at Fox News and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you look at CNN,</v>

2526
02:04:23.331 --> 02:04:25.400
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you look at him and Msnbc and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2527
02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:28.250
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of this is editorialized?</v>

2528
02:04:28.251 --> 02:04:30.580
<v Speaker 4>How much of this is opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it.</v>

2529
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:35.860
<v Speaker 4>You need unbiased facts and you almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>need it not delivered by people.</v>

2530
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

2531
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.800
<v Speaker 5>problem is when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people are delivering the news,</v>

2532
02:04:40.801 --> 02:04:41.410
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2533
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:43.380
<v Speaker 5>when you talk to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2534
02:04:43.381 --> 02:04:48.381
<v Speaker 5>they're educated in an ivy league </v>
<v Speaker 5>university and they speak a certain way,</v>

2535
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:53.990
<v Speaker 5>they act a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost kinda assume that these </v>

2536
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 5>intellectual people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these well read people are going to sort</v>

2537
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:57.540
<v Speaker 5>of lean towards one way or another.</v>

2538
02:04:58.630 --> 02:05:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I think that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is that issue.</v>

2539
02:05:00.721 --> 02:05:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2540
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again I know this is self serving,</v>

2541
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:08.661
<v Speaker 3>but I still believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the three broadcast networks have </v>

2542
02:05:08.661 --> 02:05:11.841
<v Speaker 3>actually fared quite well in what is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult environment,</v>

2543
02:05:13.321 --> 02:05:18.321
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't Count Fox as a broadcast </v>

2544
02:05:18.321 --> 02:05:18.360
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News as a cable network,</v>

2545
02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:19.910
<v Speaker 3>but Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2546
02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:25.010
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox broadcast does not have a news </v>

2547
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:25.010
<v Speaker 3>division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ABC,</v>

2548
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:25.460
<v Speaker 3>CBS and NBC do</v>

2549
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:30.400
<v Speaker 5>so just broadcast meaning traditional </v>
<v Speaker 5>old school signaling the air that nobody</v>

2550
02:05:30.401 --> 02:05:30.910
<v Speaker 5>uses anymore.</v>

2551
02:05:31.150 --> 02:05:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Nobody uses them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we will refer to them within the </v>

2552
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:36.450
<v Speaker 3>industry as the three broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that bizarre though it is,</v>

2553
02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.270
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2554
02:05:37.271 --> 02:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2555
02:05:38.171 --> 02:05:40.030
<v Speaker 3>they put up their rabbit ears and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the signal.</v>

2556
02:05:40.031 --> 02:05:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Fuck those cord cutters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme cord cutters.</v>

2557
02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Jv He got was 20 bucks if I get like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>channels and it's way better and it </v>

2558
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no lagging,</v>

2559
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:49.630
<v Speaker 3>there's no buffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>

2560
02:05:49.631 --> 02:05:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And then you get like Netflix for Hulu </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have sling.</v>

2561
02:05:53.231 --> 02:05:54.810
<v Speaker 3>But when I wanna watch a basketball game</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

2562
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:56.800
<v Speaker 3>the Ncaa basketball tournament last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

2563
02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I had to walk through the air at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good.</v>

2564
02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2565
02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:06.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like a collection tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>

2566
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:08.760
<v Speaker 3>what's the viewer benefits on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2567
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:11.770
<v Speaker 3>an evening news broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like 5 million now it's around</v>

2568
02:06:11.890 --> 02:06:12.970
<v Speaker 3>eight or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2569
02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:15.400
<v Speaker 3>So this is a really big number.</v>

2570
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't follow all of the,</v>

2571
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ticks,</v>

2572
02:06:20.350 --> 02:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the numbers,</v>

2573
02:06:22.431 --> 02:06:27.431
<v Speaker 3>so I can't answer that accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people have been predicting the </v>

2574
02:06:27.431 --> 02:06:31.020
<v Speaker 3>demise of network news for decades now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

2575
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:33.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been at ABC news for 17 years.</v>

2576
02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I've been reading obituaries all </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout that time.</v>

2577
02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Eight dollars million a night on each of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the networks is still out.</v>

2578
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:44.230
<v Speaker 3>That is a gigantic number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in an age of complete,</v>

2579
02:06:44.231 --> 02:06:45.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of micro,</v>

2580
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:51.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information of niche broadcasting and </v>

2581
02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:51.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

2582
02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:52.390
<v Speaker 3>It's all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here are the numbers right there,</v>

2583
02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.890
<v Speaker 5>NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So ABC's in the lead</v>

2584
02:06:55.110 --> 02:06:57.470
<v Speaker 3>ABC is the lead in total viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2585
02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:59.900
<v Speaker 3>so and ABC and NBC and this is just one </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

2586
02:06:59.901 --> 02:07:03.850
<v Speaker 3>March 27th right around eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then CBS is six point five.</v>

2587
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:08.870
<v Speaker 3>So gets a lot of people excuse super old</v>
<v Speaker 3>though because it does because that </v>

2588
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:09.110
<v Speaker 3>demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely as soon as excused.</v>

2589
02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very old.</v>

2590
02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:10.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all people.</v>

2591
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:14.700
<v Speaker 5>That's the majority is people over 54 or</v>
<v Speaker 5>under 25,</v>

2592
02:07:14.701 --> 02:07:18.660
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that's the case at 25 </v>
<v Speaker 5>to 54.</v>

2593
02:07:18.661 --> 02:07:23.661
<v Speaker 5>ABC as one point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>6 million as opposed to a 8 million </v>

2594
02:07:23.661 --> 02:07:24.890
<v Speaker 5>total viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>NBC,</v>

2595
02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

2596
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:29.910
<v Speaker 5>seven point 8 million total viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One point 7 million.</v>

2597
02:07:30.010 --> 02:07:32.070
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five to 54.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then CBS,</v>

2598
02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:35.060
<v Speaker 5>six point $4 million total.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One point $3.</v>

2599
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five to 54.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>

2600
02:07:36.731 --> 02:07:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Like after 54.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you put before 25.</v>

2601
02:07:39.911 --> 02:07:42.730
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You concentrate on this one.</v>

2602
02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.460
<v Speaker 3>It is what advertisers want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

2603
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 3>the vitality.</v>

2604
02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:49.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna be the ads,</v>

2605
02:07:50.010 --> 02:07:52.010
<v Speaker 5>the ads you run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2606
02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:52.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2607
02:07:53.110 --> 02:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>that are anti inflammatory in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the morning because in the morning </v>

2608
02:07:59.261 --> 02:08:00.940
<v Speaker 3>shows where we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more,</v>

2609
02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:05.680
<v Speaker 3>it's closer to four or $5 million for </v>
<v Speaker 3>ABC and NBC and a little less for CPS.</v>

2610
02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of that audience that </v>

2611
02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 3>falls within the demo as we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 to 54 is higher.</v>

2612
02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:17.551
<v Speaker 3>And so the ads are kind of different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess my point is that you still </v>

2613
02:08:17.551 --> 02:08:21.241
<v Speaker 3>have a really significant number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people if you take the mornings and </v>

2614
02:08:21.241 --> 02:08:25.681
<v Speaker 3>evenings on these broadcast networks </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are getting their news from these </v>

2615
02:08:25.681 --> 02:08:28.771
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which just gets back to the </v>

2616
02:08:28.771 --> 02:08:31.021
<v Speaker 3>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the polarized media atmosphere you were </v>

2617
02:08:31.021 --> 02:08:31.530
<v Speaker 3>talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in this atmosphere that the,</v>

2618
02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:34.630
<v Speaker 3>that having the networks be seen to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain extent.</v>

2619
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:39.990
<v Speaker 3>To the extent possible as above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fright actually is important for </v>

2620
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:43.441
<v Speaker 3>democracy is Alex Jones get was I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>40 million a week,</v>

2621
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:49.180
<v Speaker 3>but they include like a website hits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're big number.</v>

2622
02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:54.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's a skewed number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent some time with him to have </v>

2623
02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 3>you know him very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went down to Boston and I went down to</v>

2624
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Austin and sent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2625
02:08:58.730 --> 02:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2626
02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:04.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long a basically spent a day at </v>

2627
02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:05.650
<v Speaker 3>hanging around his operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>

2628
02:09:05.710 --> 02:09:10.710
<v Speaker 3>and I would say 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a while ago before the </v>

2629
02:09:10.710 --> 02:09:12.010
<v Speaker 3>monolithic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty big back then,</v>

2630
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:13.630
<v Speaker 3>but not what it is now</v>

2631
02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:18.440
<v Speaker 5>in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones and I put on George Bush,</v>

2632
02:09:18.441 --> 02:09:23.300
<v Speaker 5>senior and junior masks and we smoked </v>
<v Speaker 5>pot out of a bong and then danced around</v>

2633
02:09:23.301 --> 02:09:24.860
<v Speaker 5>the white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the White House,</v>

2634
02:09:24.861 --> 02:09:29.861
<v Speaker 5>the capital building in in Texas for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>standup video that I did.</v>

2635
02:09:30.610 --> 02:09:35.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been friends with that guy since </v>

2636
02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:35.610
<v Speaker 5>99.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I listened.</v>

2637
02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:39.970
<v Speaker 5>I listened to your recent podcast with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was just it'll dimensional child </v>

2638
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:42.170
<v Speaker 5>molesters that are infiltrating our </v>
<v Speaker 5>airwaves.</v>

2639
02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2640
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.620
<v Speaker 5>he went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got them high and drunk and he went.</v>

2641
02:09:45.621 --> 02:09:50.621
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went as deep as he's ever gotten </v>

2642
02:09:50.621 --> 02:09:50.621
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

2643
02:09:50.621 --> 02:09:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you find that he is different when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not being recorded?</v>

2644
02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2645
02:09:53.110 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

2646
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.290
<v Speaker 3>is screaming and yelling.</v>

2647
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.370
<v Speaker 9>That's him singing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>by the way.</v>

2648
02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:14.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the.</v>

2649
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.240
<v Speaker 5>He made up these lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This song is all him.</v>

2650
02:10:18.330 --> 02:10:20.910
<v Speaker 5>I believe he might've ad libbed it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>give us.</v>

2651
02:10:20.911 --> 02:10:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Give me some volume on this.</v>

2652
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:27.240
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that was the name of my dvds,</v>

2653
02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:29.530
<v Speaker 9>belly of the beast from Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Texas.</v>

2654
02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:34.860
<v Speaker 9>Strap yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's Alex.</v>

2655
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 5>he's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2656
02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:43.710
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely different when he's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>being recorded,</v>

2657
02:10:43.711 --> 02:10:45.220
<v Speaker 5>but he is that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2658
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.750
<v Speaker 5>he believes it's sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People leaves all this stuff.</v>

2659
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:52.930
<v Speaker 5>He believes a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2660
02:10:53.490 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 5>whether it's correct or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a different argument whether or </v>

2661
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 5>not he believes it.</v>

2662
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I was struck and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent a full day with them and then we</v>

2663
02:11:02.121 --> 02:11:04.400
<v Speaker 3>had dinner with him afterwards who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>not recorded.</v>

2664
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:09.430
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was struck by the difference in </v>

2665
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.740
<v Speaker 3>demeanor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2666
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:11.610
<v Speaker 3>off camera and not being rent.</v>

2667
02:11:11.850 --> 02:11:12.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely that.</v>

2668
02:11:12.721 --> 02:11:13.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not saying that,</v>

2669
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:15.130
<v Speaker 3>leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2670
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:16.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

2671
02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

2672
02:11:17.010 --> 02:11:20.940
<v Speaker 5>He's a showman for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's really disturbing is when he gets</v>

2673
02:11:20.941 --> 02:11:22.470
<v Speaker 5>stuff right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2674
02:11:22.471 --> 02:11:24.810
<v Speaker 5>like the World Trade Organization is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect example.</v>

2675
02:11:24.811 --> 02:11:29.550
<v Speaker 5>He was one of the ones that highlighted </v>
<v Speaker 5>the use of a agent provocateurs now what</v>

2676
02:11:29.551 --> 02:11:31.770
<v Speaker 5>agency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who hires these people,</v>

2677
02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:34.290
<v Speaker 5>but what they do is they take something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the WTO,</v>

2678
02:11:34.291 --> 02:11:39.291
<v Speaker 5>which was a big embarrassment that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were protesting the WTO and they </v>

2679
02:11:39.601 --> 02:11:43.080
<v Speaker 5>hire people to turn this peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 5>protest into a violent protest,</v>

2680
02:11:43.081 --> 02:11:44.820
<v Speaker 5>so these people come in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were ski masks,</v>

2681
02:11:44.970 --> 02:11:49.970
<v Speaker 5>they break windows and they light things</v>
<v Speaker 5>on fire or do whatever they do that </v>

2682
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:52.980
<v Speaker 5>makes it violent and then they have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cops come in and break it up because now</v>

2683
02:11:52.981 --> 02:11:57.981
<v Speaker 5>it's no longer a peaceful protest and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>it got to the point where people were </v>

2684
02:11:57.981 --> 02:12:01.130
<v Speaker 5>trying to show up for work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had WTO Pinzon that aligned through</v>

2685
02:12:01.131 --> 02:12:01.350
<v Speaker 5>it well.</v>

2686
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 5>They had created a no protest zone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were taking his on footage on the </v>

2687
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:07.050
<v Speaker 5>news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were telling people,</v>

2688
02:12:07.051 --> 02:12:10.800
<v Speaker 5>you have to take the pin off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't go through this area where you</v>

2689
02:12:10.801 --> 02:12:15.750
<v Speaker 5>work with a WTO pin on your backpack or </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your jacket.</v>

2690
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy,</v>

2691
02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:23.060
<v Speaker 5>and he highlighted that and made a in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that use of agent provocateurs has been </v>

2692
02:12:23.911 --> 02:12:28.911
<v Speaker 5>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a real thing and it's a real </v>

2693
02:12:28.911 --> 02:12:29.280
<v Speaker 5>tactic that again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what agency,</v>

2694
02:12:29.281 --> 02:12:34.281
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what faction of the military would </v>

2695
02:12:34.281 --> 02:12:34.281
<v Speaker 5>fashion the government hires these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to do that I don't know,</v>

2696
02:12:34.281 --> 02:12:38.630
<v Speaker 5>but it is a real thing and I did not </v>
<v Speaker 5>know about that until Alex highlighted </v>

2697
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:39.780
<v Speaker 5>it on one of his V,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one in one of his videos.</v>

2698
02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 5>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been proven that it's real and so </v>

2699
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:46.980
<v Speaker 5>that alone is disturbing when you stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and think about all the different things</v>

2700
02:12:46.981 --> 02:12:48.480
<v Speaker 5>that he's informed.</v>

2701
02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:52.290
<v Speaker 5>People of that turned out were real like</v>
<v Speaker 5>operation northwoods when the freedom of</v>

2702
02:12:52.291 --> 02:12:57.291
<v Speaker 5>Information Act came out with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>operation northwoods document where the </v>

2703
02:12:57.291 --> 02:12:59.730
<v Speaker 5>Joint Chiefs of staff at sign this and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this was something that they were really</v>

2704
02:12:59.731 --> 02:13:04.731
<v Speaker 5>trying to implement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were going to arm Cuban friendlies </v>

2705
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:04.731
<v Speaker 5>and have them attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted them obey.</v>

2706
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:06.460
<v Speaker 5>They were going to blow up a drone </v>
<v Speaker 5>jetliner.</v>

2707
02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 5>They're going to blame it on the Cubans </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were trying to use this as </v>

2708
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 5>impetus to get us to go to war with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cuba.</v>

2709
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.000
<v Speaker 5>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how do you feel about the things </v>

2710
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:16.000
<v Speaker 5>that he's talking about that are well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2711
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:16.380
<v Speaker 5>but let's talk about that first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2712
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:20.340
<v Speaker 5>there are things that are true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what gets really squirrely.</v>

2713
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.520
<v Speaker 5>What gets really squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like when when you find out that </v>

2714
02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.940
<v Speaker 5>there have been things like the Gulf of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tonkin incident,</v>

2715
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:32.230
<v Speaker 5>like there's many things that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened where there have been false </v>

2716
02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:32.230
<v Speaker 5>where the government</v>

2717
02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:37.220
<v Speaker 4>has conspired to lie to the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and people have died because of </v>

2718
02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:38.880
<v Speaker 4>it I think will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know a lot about Gulf of Tonkin,</v>

2719
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:42.930
<v Speaker 4>but although I know more about it than </v>
<v Speaker 4>than those other examples.</v>

2720
02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:48.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are definitely cases where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an additional interpretation to say</v>

2721
02:13:50.641 --> 02:13:53.910
<v Speaker 4>that the government lied to take even </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's closer to hand.</v>

2722
02:13:53.911 --> 02:13:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Like we have weapons of mass destruction</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a pretext to go into Iraq right now.</v>

2723
02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:04.460
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing to say that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowingly lied about that Bush and </v>

2724
02:14:04.741 --> 02:14:09.741
<v Speaker 4>Cheney knowingly lied to the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>people about that or they were misled by</v>

2725
02:14:10.141 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 4>people who are knowingly lying or just </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone got it wrong.</v>

2726
02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just.</v>

2727
02:14:15.481 --> 02:14:18.060
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was totally plausible to everyone who</v>

2728
02:14:18.061 --> 02:14:23.061
<v Speaker 4>was informed that he had a WMD program </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they misinterpreted whatever </v>

2729
02:14:24.061 --> 02:14:26.430
<v Speaker 4>evidence they thought they had and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were just wrong.</v>

2730
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a spectrum.</v>

2731
02:14:29.090 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not claiming to know which one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those is true.</v>

2732
02:14:30.781 --> 02:14:35.781
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably probably the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>is much closer to the truth and that </v>

2733
02:14:35.911 --> 02:14:38.470
<v Speaker 4>explains many of these instances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2734
02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:43.480
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was so corrosive about pure </v>

2735
02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:44.160
<v Speaker 4>examples of line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2736
02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:46.170
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2737
02:14:46.171 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 4>and we may have one case now this just </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerging in the news.</v>

2738
02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the,</v>

2739
02:14:51.231 --> 02:14:52.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story has been clarified while we've</v>

2740
02:14:52.921 --> 02:14:57.921
<v Speaker 4>been talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is now seems that Susan Rice </v>

2741
02:14:57.921 --> 02:15:02.210
<v Speaker 4>came out at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said she knew nothing about the </v>

2742
02:15:02.210 --> 02:15:05.691
<v Speaker 4>unmasking of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of trump associates in this recent </v>

2743
02:15:05.691 --> 02:15:10.480
<v Speaker 4>surveillance case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now it seems that she is claiming </v>

2744
02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.540
<v Speaker 4>that she actually asked to have certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>names,</v>

2745
02:15:12.541 --> 02:15:16.350
<v Speaker 4>unmasked and stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is being seized upon again,</v>

2746
02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:20.000
<v Speaker 4>just in the last few hours as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

2747
02:15:20.001 --> 02:15:21.780
<v Speaker 4>an example of a lie.</v>

2748
02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which seems very sinister.</v>

2749
02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as though it equalizes the two sides</v>

2750
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:29.430
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2751
02:15:29.431 --> 02:15:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Let's low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say worst case scenario,</v>

2752
02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Susan Rice lied about having some </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of this investigation.</v>

2753
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't.</v>

2754
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:40.320
<v Speaker 4>It says something bad about Susan Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says something.</v>

2755
02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:42.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has to deal with the consequences of</v>

2756
02:15:42.061 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 4>that lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't exonerate all of the line</v>

2757
02:15:45.481 --> 02:15:47.520
<v Speaker 4>that trump has done about everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the sun.</v>

2758
02:15:47.521 --> 02:15:52.521
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So w what so destabilizing here is at </v>

2759
02:15:52.521 --> 02:15:56.010
<v Speaker 4>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment ms dot even true of honest </v>

2760
02:15:56.010 --> 02:15:57.750
<v Speaker 4>errors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment that a news organization like</v>

2761
02:15:57.751 --> 02:16:02.751
<v Speaker 4>yours or the New York Times commits an </v>
<v Speaker 4>honest error that it gets pointed to </v>

2762
02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:08.900
<v Speaker 4>from those who want to treat the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mainstream news media as fake news as </v>

2763
02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:10.260
<v Speaker 4>see everything's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2764
02:16:10.261 --> 02:16:10.660
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2765
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:16.100
<v Speaker 4>like you're no better than than somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just manufacturing fake news on a </v>

2766
02:16:16.141 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 4>laptop in his basement.</v>

2767
02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

2768
02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:21.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2769
02:16:21.650 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 4>and the flip side of that is when Alex </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones get something right,</v>

2770
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.100
<v Speaker 4>it seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to make him look like a,</v>

2771
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:34.470
<v Speaker 4>a dignified journalistic enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 4>analogous to the New York Times or to </v>

2772
02:16:34.470 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>ABC News.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And neither of those things are true.</v>

2773
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:41.911
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are small lies and then they're a </v>

2774
02:16:41.911 --> 02:16:41.911
<v Speaker 4>huge lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are honest mistakes,</v>

2775
02:16:41.911 --> 02:16:46.760
<v Speaker 4>but be committed by totally reputable </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations that are really trying to </v>

2776
02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:49.650
<v Speaker 4>get their facts straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there are malicious that's just</v>

2777
02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:54.660
<v Speaker 4>militia malicious propaganda outlets </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are not at all trying to get their </v>

2778
02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:58.651
<v Speaker 4>facts straight and trying to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's credulity and ignorance into </v>

2779
02:16:58.651 --> 02:17:00.810
<v Speaker 4>something that is just purely a matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2780
02:17:01.350 --> 02:17:01.850
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2781
02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:03.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tribal,</v>

2782
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:04.680
<v Speaker 4>a sentiment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2783
02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:09.720
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we lose our ability to distinguish </v>

2784
02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 4>these different projects when we say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

2785
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fake news.</v>

2786
02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:15.790
<v Speaker 4>It both sides do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or here's a lie.</v>

2787
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:20.791
<v Speaker 4>Here's Susan Rice's one lie that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>told in the last 10 years maybe in got </v>

2788
02:17:20.791 --> 02:17:24.661
<v Speaker 4>caught for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have a president who lies every </v>

2789
02:17:24.661 --> 02:17:25.470
<v Speaker 4>time he picks up his approaches a mike </v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2790
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.410
<v Speaker 4>or picks up his twitter.</v>

2791
02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.440
<v Speaker 2>She had other problems because she had </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone on,</v>

2792
02:17:28.441 --> 02:17:33.441
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Sunday morning talk shows after </v>

2793
02:17:33.441 --> 02:17:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Ben Gazi with some talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2794
02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2795
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:37.990
<v Speaker 2>soon as Susan look like she was itching </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get caught.</v>

2796
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether this was a case of.</v>

2797
02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2798
02:17:42.210 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2799
02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I think your point is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important because I think that when</v>

2800
02:17:46.441 --> 02:17:47.640
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2801
02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:50.400
<v Speaker 2>if you have one side that lies all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

2802
02:17:50.610 --> 02:17:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it's imperative that the other side </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't lie at all.</v>

2803
02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2804
02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the line and say,</v>

2805
02:17:55.711 --> 02:17:56.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody does this.</v>

2806
02:17:56.521 --> 02:18:01.521
<v Speaker 2>Why it's a tense time for people in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of work because we were so much </v>

2807
02:18:02.311 --> 02:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>scrutiny and then we get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really,</v>

2808
02:18:06.390 --> 02:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take a lot of heat,</v>

2809
02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>but when we get it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're pretty quick to say we got</v>

2810
02:18:11.881 --> 02:18:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the actual.</v>

2811
02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the Donald trump</v>

2812
02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:18.810
<v Speaker 4>junior said that cernovich get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulitzer for exposing Susan Rice.</v>

2813
02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2815
02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:22.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's it.</v>

2816
02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:27.620
<v Speaker 4>That's why this drives me a little crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it is not cernovich is the fact </v>

2817
02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:28.370
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is</v>

2818
02:18:30.050 --> 02:18:35.050
<v Speaker 2>why did you lead them down the Cernovich</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just gave them right back into </v>

2819
02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>its yard in front of the kit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're only now discovering the </v>

2820
02:18:39.401 --> 02:18:42.610
<v Speaker 2>consequences of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's come back in five years,</v>

2821
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 2>see if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about anything that </v>

2822
02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 2>makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2823
02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:49.130
<v Speaker 2>it's all very blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2824
02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it really is very blurred because we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never had a situation like this where we</v>

2825
02:18:52.391 --> 02:18:56.410
<v Speaker 2>have a president that people just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust to be honest.</v>

2826
02:18:56.411 --> 02:19:01.411
<v Speaker 2>And when someone would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone lied about anything in the </v>

2827
02:19:01.411 --> 02:19:01.411
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if Donald Trump got caught having</v>

2828
02:19:01.411 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 2>his dick sucked in the White House to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>on film and you know,</v>

2829
02:19:04.211 --> 02:19:04.900
<v Speaker 2>he built like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2830
02:19:04.901 --> 02:19:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake when he wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing would be nothing.</v>

2831
02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Photoshop did that fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just again,</v>

2832
02:19:12.101 --> 02:19:17.101
<v Speaker 2>just slot to use Joseph Goldstein's </v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase before about slotting into </v>

2833
02:19:17.101 --> 02:19:19.780
<v Speaker 2>geological time and just looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader scope of history,</v>

2834
02:19:19.781 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had really,</v>

2835
02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:25.960
<v Speaker 2>we've had periods of time where we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>media than the muck rakers,</v>

2836
02:19:25.961 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the media outlets</v>

2837
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:31.310
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't even pretend at times to,</v>

2838
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:32.510
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2839
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 3>to not have an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Items where those.</v>

2840
02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And the early parts of our republic </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we had was a teddy Roosevelt </v>

2841
02:19:42.951 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 3>called the journalists muck rakers </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2842
02:19:45.321 --> 02:19:47.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically,</v>

2843
02:19:47.151 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that their job was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write muck,</v>

2844
02:19:49.101 --> 02:19:53.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be working in filth and uh,</v>

2845
02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:59.410
<v Speaker 3>the media and American politics have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been filled with instances,</v>

2846
02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:04.540
<v Speaker 3>American media and American politics had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been filled with instances over our </v>

2847
02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:08.160
<v Speaker 3>short history of a untruths and agendas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2848
02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:14.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we have times of relative </v>

2849
02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:15.931
<v Speaker 3>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes we slide back into </v>

2850
02:20:15.931 --> 02:20:18.400
<v Speaker 3>more tumultuous times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe the Pollyanna here,</v>

2851
02:20:18.401 --> 02:20:23.401
<v Speaker 3>but I think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the republic will survive and that we </v>

2852
02:20:23.401 --> 02:20:27.061
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't inexorably lead to a time </v>

2853
02:20:27.061 --> 02:20:27.061
<v Speaker 3>where truth doesn't matter.</v>

2854
02:20:27.430 --> 02:20:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to open up the door for a </v>

2855
02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:35.551
<v Speaker 2>viable alternative seems to open up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door for someone who comes along who is </v>

2856
02:20:35.551 --> 02:20:38.550
<v Speaker 2>in many ways bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a very ethical.</v>

2857
02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It's opened a door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2858
02:20:39.611 --> 02:20:42.630
<v Speaker 2>now anyone talking to somebody to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>for office.</v>

2859
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2860
02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think anybody's bulletproof</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

2861
02:20:46.090 --> 02:20:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the exception of Joe Rogan,</v>

2862
02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but definitely not bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be bulletproof.</v>

2863
02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has got nothing but bullet </v>

2864
02:20:55.770 --> 02:20:56.380
<v Speaker 2>holes in him when he's president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Joe was saying is it opens the door</v>

2865
02:20:56.381 --> 02:21:01.381
<v Speaker 2>to somebody who's on a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>viable alternative for someone who is </v>

2866
02:21:01.381 --> 02:21:03.890
<v Speaker 2>ethical seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His door is open to anyone who,</v>

2867
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:05.670
<v Speaker 2>who couldn't be president at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2868
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:07.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no one that steps forward right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2869
02:21:07.661 --> 02:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

2870
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're waiting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like who?</v>

2871
02:21:11.230 --> 02:21:14.200
<v Speaker 2>First of all it will say you couldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

2872
02:21:14.201 --> 02:21:16.680
<v Speaker 2>There was never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has never been an atheist.</v>

2873
02:21:16.681 --> 02:21:18.850
<v Speaker 2>They would attach your twitter page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2874
02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:21.160
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would hire him.</v>

2875
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:22.490
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>

2876
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:27.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to use a conventional </v>

2877
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.710
<v Speaker 4>political calculus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then yeah.</v>

2878
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:32.021
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an atheist be an atheist to having a </v>

2879
02:21:32.021 --> 02:21:34.880
<v Speaker 4>history of psychedelic drug use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having edgy positions.</v>

2880
02:21:34.881 --> 02:21:35.860
<v Speaker 4>That alienates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2881
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:39.170
<v Speaker 4>massive a constituent constituencies I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all of that.</v>

2882
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 4>A deal breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I could,</v>

2883
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:46.270
<v Speaker 4>you would never have predicted that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone this scandalous and inept and </v>

2884
02:21:48.051 --> 02:21:51.620
<v Speaker 4>dishonest and provably so at every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he can't.</v>

2885
02:21:51.621 --> 02:21:56.621
<v Speaker 4>He literally can't get through an hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the day without something that would </v>

2886
02:21:56.621 --> 02:21:59.080
<v Speaker 4>have been a scandal in some previous age</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth coming out of his,</v>

2887
02:21:59.610 --> 02:22:01.360
<v Speaker 4>his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2888
02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.070
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2889
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:05.060
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2890
02:22:05.061 --> 02:22:10.061
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's no predicting who could </v>

2891
02:22:10.061 --> 02:22:11.560
<v Speaker 4>be a president in the future mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2892
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:16.490
<v Speaker 4>it's you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need wealth and you need charisma on</v>

2893
02:22:16.491 --> 02:22:17.300
<v Speaker 4>some level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to,</v>

2894
02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:20.330
<v Speaker 4>you need to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a tribe behind you.</v>

2895
02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:25.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think you need any of what </v>

2896
02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 4>people thought you needed even a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

2897
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's done by circumventing the </v>

2898
02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:34.500
<v Speaker 4>whole system and bay being independently</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthy is really kinda.</v>

2899
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:39.530
<v Speaker 4>But even that was a jam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was amazing is that he is </v>

2900
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:42.681
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much money he actually </v>

2901
02:22:42.681 --> 02:22:44.481
<v Speaker 4>put into his campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not nearly what you would </v>

2902
02:22:44.481 --> 02:22:44.481
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you.</v>

2903
02:22:44.481 --> 02:22:48.051
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really only had to pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be that wealthy and it was incredible.</v>

2904
02:22:48.091 --> 02:22:48.450
<v Speaker 4>What happened.</v>

2905
02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Like is what he achieved with very </v>
<v Speaker 3>little campaign funds and you know what </v>

2906
02:22:55.470 --> 02:22:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a,</v>

2907
02:22:56.850 --> 02:22:59.270
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like them or not,</v>

2908
02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you have to give him credit for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable victory that very few </v>

2909
02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:05.060
<v Speaker 3>people saw it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a popularity contest.</v>

2910
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that part of the problem as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>made a popular person president of a </v>

2911
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:11.320
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2912
02:23:11.330 --> 02:23:12.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2913
02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:14.500
<v Speaker 3>he was running against somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't popular.</v>

2914
02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.120
<v Speaker 3>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it in context.</v>

2915
02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:22.520
<v Speaker 3>We're always coming after eight years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Democratic president who was </v>

2916
02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.291
<v Speaker 3>controversial in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's always harder for somebody at </v>

2917
02:23:26.291 --> 02:23:30.101
<v Speaker 3>the same party to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are a lot of dynamics large or </v>

2918
02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:31.490
<v Speaker 3>impersonal dynamics that were working in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his favor.</v>

2919
02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

2920
02:23:33.850 --> 02:23:36.310
<v Speaker 3>But when we get back to the argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>

2921
02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:39.020
<v Speaker 3>are we in apocalyptic times or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2922
02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:40.640
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything,</v>

2923
02:23:40.641 --> 02:23:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2924
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:45.200
<v Speaker 3>but my instinct is just as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

2925
02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:48.020
<v Speaker 3>we've seen times have much worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>division.</v>

2926
02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:50.510
<v Speaker 3>We had a civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2927
02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:54.470
<v Speaker 4>it's telling that you have to go back </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for,</v>

2928
02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:56.420
<v Speaker 4>for a compelling example,</v>

2929
02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:59.260
<v Speaker 3>this would've been the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2930
02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:01.730
<v Speaker 3>People in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the weather underground.</v>

2931
02:24:01.731 --> 02:24:02.590
<v Speaker 3>We had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2932
02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 3>we was pretty to what we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had mlk and rfk assassinated right at</v>

2933
02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:10.280
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2934
02:24:10.350 --> 02:24:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm worried about now is I think </v>

2935
02:24:15.631 --> 02:24:19.130
<v Speaker 4>he's truly unique and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

2936
02:24:19.810 --> 02:24:24.810
<v Speaker 4>the way we're becoming unmoored from </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of the ordinary truth testing in </v>

2937
02:24:27.031 --> 02:24:30.810
<v Speaker 4>politics I think is unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fact that we have a president</v>

2938
02:24:30.811 --> 02:24:34.680
<v Speaker 4>who seen it because there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>feedback mechanism and maybe trump seems</v>

2939
02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:39.681
<v Speaker 4>to get some of his information from info</v>
<v Speaker 4>wars and from places like info wars at </v>

2940
02:24:40.221 --> 02:24:40.270
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

2941
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he pays a price for,</v>

2942
02:24:43.361 --> 02:24:44.710
<v Speaker 3>for his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2943
02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:48.310
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his popularity rating is not high.</v>

2944
02:24:48.450 --> 02:24:48.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:50.640
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's paying some price.</v>

2946
02:24:50.641 --> 02:24:55.641
<v Speaker 4>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it going to be enough and what </v>

2947
02:24:55.641 --> 02:24:56.190
<v Speaker 4>happens within the next terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack?</v>

2948
02:24:56.191 --> 02:24:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2949
02:24:56.540 --> 02:25:01.540
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the real fear is that if we have a </v>

2950
02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:02.520
<v Speaker 4>rush dog fire kind of moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2951
02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:05.610
<v Speaker 4>engineered by him or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2952
02:25:05.611 --> 02:25:08.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so paranoid as to think he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do it,</v>

2953
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:11.940
<v Speaker 4>but I just think it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that's going to happen.</v>

2954
02:25:11.941 --> 02:25:12.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

2955
02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:14.520
<v Speaker 4>we've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've had 80 days,</v>

2956
02:25:14.521 --> 02:25:19.521
<v Speaker 4>100 days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's been of his presidency </v>

2957
02:25:19.521 --> 02:25:20.760
<v Speaker 4>were basically nothing has happened and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been pure chaos,</v>

2958
02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:25.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the work of governments not getting </v>

2959
02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:27.100
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government's barely even staffed and</v>

2960
02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:30.910
<v Speaker 4>this has been a period of work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing really has happened,</v>

2961
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:35.940
<v Speaker 4>but imagine a nine slash 11 size event </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something really goes off the rails </v>

2962
02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>with North Korea or China or Russia.</v>

2963
02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will be so.</v>

2964
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2965
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:48.060
<v Speaker 4>the pressure when the pressure to </v>
<v Speaker 4>normalize him as commander in chief will</v>

2966
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:54.121
<v Speaker 4>be much greater than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And already everyone's feeling that </v>

2967
02:25:54.121 --> 02:25:54.280
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2968
02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:55.600
<v Speaker 4>but to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2969
02:25:55.670 --> 02:26:00.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to clamp down on civil </v>

2970
02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:02.130
<v Speaker 4>liberties and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2971
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:03.850
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2972
02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:07.180
<v Speaker 4>use the power of the presidency in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2973
02:26:07.290 --> 02:26:10.480
<v Speaker 4>that will be very difficult for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2974
02:26:11.170 --> 02:26:13.240
<v Speaker 4>our society to recover from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just,</v>

2975
02:26:13.241 --> 02:26:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

2976
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:17.350
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a scary moment and I'm,</v>

2977
02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:18.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2978
02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:23.160
<v Speaker 4>I the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who are drawn analogies </v>

2979
02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:24.800
<v Speaker 4>between him and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2980
02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:26.560
<v Speaker 4>the thirties in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2981
02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:29.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany.</v>

2982
02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2983
02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:35.290
<v Speaker 4>I think those analogies are misleading </v>
<v Speaker 4>in ways,</v>

2984
02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.320
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just don't know how strange things </v>

2985
02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.020
<v Speaker 4>could get in with a big negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulus to the system with what I think</v>

2986
02:26:44.021 --> 02:26:49.021
<v Speaker 4>we know is that we have someone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>charge who is a malignantly selfish </v>

2987
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:52.660
<v Speaker 4>conman.</v>

2988
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is an objective fact.</v>

2989
02:26:54.851 --> 02:26:57.130
<v Speaker 4>That's not a partisan thing to say he </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2990
02:26:57.530 --> 02:27:02.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's as obvious about him as his hair </v>

2991
02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:06.540
<v Speaker 4>and to have that much power in the hands</v>
<v Speaker 4>of somebody who is that,</v>

2992
02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:12.160
<v Speaker 4>whose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose ethical compass is that unreliable</v>

2993
02:27:12.161 --> 02:27:14.860
<v Speaker 4>or reliably bad in my view?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got,</v>

2994
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say this if pence who scares </v>
<v Speaker 4>me for other reasons.</v>

2995
02:27:17.471 --> 02:27:20.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a theocrat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say this of,</v>

2996
02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:24.160
<v Speaker 4>of most Republicans who I might disagree</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2997
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.640
<v Speaker 4>but there's just something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to put that much power in the hands </v>

2998
02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:29.880
<v Speaker 4>of somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2999
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:35.790
<v Speaker 4>is so disconnected from facts and a and </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable concern for the wellbeing of,</v>

3000
02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:39.790
<v Speaker 4>of the rest of humanity and the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean it's just,</v>

3001
02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an incredible moment and I don't </v>

3002
02:27:45.450 --> 02:27:47.440
<v Speaker 4>think we've ever had a president who you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could look at and say that about.</v>

3003
02:27:47.441 --> 02:27:48.700
<v Speaker 4>So clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3004
02:27:48.701 --> 02:27:52.810
<v Speaker 4>not even Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixon was pathological in other ways,</v>

3005
02:27:52.811 --> 02:27:57.811
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixon Nixon was given us the clean air </v>

3006
02:27:57.811 --> 02:27:57.811
<v Speaker 4>act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3007
02:27:57.811 --> 02:28:01.261
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixon had some point of contact with </v>

3008
02:28:01.261 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 4>terrestrial reality which wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>about figuring out how to,</v>

3009
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:07.510
<v Speaker 4>how to burnish his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his imaginary grander,</v>

3010
02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:09.210
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3011
02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:11.650
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3012
02:28:11.651 --> 02:28:14.930
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3013
02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.360
<v Speaker 4>I think we're one huge news story away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from finding out how bad a president he </v>

3014
02:28:20.411 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 4>could be and think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's.</v>

3015
02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:24.190
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

3016
02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.840
<v Speaker 3>he could surprise that he could surprise</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the people who are very </v>

3017
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:29.840
<v Speaker 3>pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3018
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:29.840
<v Speaker 3>he could also rise to the occasion.</v>

3019
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3020
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3021
02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:40.360
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean also like to know how I would be </v>

3022
02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:41.460
<v Speaker 4>the first to give him or the system the </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit for that.</v>

3023
02:28:41.461 --> 02:28:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3024
02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:43.810
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3025
02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:49.040
<v Speaker 4>if he starts doing something good like </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say a massive infrastructure </v>

3026
02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:49.140
<v Speaker 4>project,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3027
02:28:49.141 --> 02:28:53.100
<v Speaker 4>That includes building out good things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not coal jobs,</v>

3028
02:28:53.101 --> 02:28:54.610
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>

3029
02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:56.880
<v Speaker 4>fixing bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean infrastructure.</v>

3030
02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3031
02:28:57.830 --> 02:29:00.330
<v Speaker 4>If he starts doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3032
02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 4>that I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

3033
02:29:01.530 --> 02:29:02.670
<v Speaker 4>that'd be fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3034
02:29:02.671 --> 02:29:05.490
<v Speaker 4>And it's possible he could start doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that for his own.</v>

3035
02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:11.220
<v Speaker 4>His motives wouldn't even matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately as long as he was doing the </v>

3036
02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:14.880
<v Speaker 4>right things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his motives are so reliably,</v>

3037
02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3038
02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:22.470
<v Speaker 4>self-involved that give me what we need </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a system we need to.</v>

3039
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Someone needs to be able to play him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3040
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:30.280
<v Speaker 4>this kind of narcissistic Glockenspiel </v>
<v Speaker 4>well enough to get him to do the things </v>

3041
02:29:30.341 --> 02:29:33.010
<v Speaker 4>that would be good for the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't see.</v>

3042
02:29:33.011 --> 02:29:33.570
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

3043
02:29:33.610 --> 02:29:37.450
<v Speaker 4>there's just too much chaos in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system for that to be a reliable.</v>

3044
02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>

3045
02:29:38.351 --> 02:29:43.351
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they try to keep him away from social </v>

3046
02:29:43.351 --> 02:29:43.351
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3047
02:29:43.351 --> 02:29:43.351
<v Speaker 4>well that's working out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3048
02:29:43.351 --> 02:29:44.140
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big thing,</v>

3049
02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:46.330
<v Speaker 4>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They try to pull him away from it.</v>

3050
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's been impossible.</v>

3051
02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:51.630
<v Speaker 4>No one can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3052
02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:52.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3053
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:57.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that crazy press conference </v>

3054
02:29:57.490 --> 02:29:58.420
<v Speaker 4>that he had like just a few weeks into </v>
<v Speaker 4>being president.</v>

3055
02:29:58.421 --> 02:29:59.660
<v Speaker 4>I was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

3056
02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I got text messages from friends that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are Republicans and they're like,</v>

3057
02:30:02.441 --> 02:30:03.310
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

3058
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3059
02:30:04.551 --> 02:30:06.080
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting,</v>

3060
02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:11.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting sort of Roshak test </v>

3061
02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:14.110
<v Speaker 3>because there are millions of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>who watched that press conference and </v>

3062
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:15.600
<v Speaker 3>founded delightfully thought they </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that he was killed,</v>

3063
02:30:15.601 --> 02:30:18.410
<v Speaker 3>but pounding on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the liberal media.</v>

3064
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you read a transcript,</v>

3065
02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:25.000
<v Speaker 4>when you read a transcript of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually comes out of his mouth,</v>

3066
02:30:25.290 --> 02:30:26.650
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is amazing.</v>

3067
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:27.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3068
02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:32.680
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the poverty of the passages in terms of </v>

3069
02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:36.600
<v Speaker 4>information and I mean it's just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that we have a president who speaks</v>

3070
02:30:36.851 --> 02:30:39.130
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is cool.</v>

3071
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:43.660
<v Speaker 4>I could never have foreseen that in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetime this was going to happen.</v>

3072
02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unimaginable to me.</v>

3073
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people there are just </v>

3074
02:30:52.210 --> 02:30:52.210
<v Speaker 3>indisputable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of elitist signed it,</v>

3075
02:30:52.210 --> 02:30:55.250
<v Speaker 3>riff league concern to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see bill Maher's</v>

3076
02:30:55.420 --> 02:31:00.420
<v Speaker 4>thing about Anthony Wiener that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that Anthony Wiener should run </v>

3077
02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.481
<v Speaker 4>against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need our own crazy mad anthony </v>

3078
02:31:03.481 --> 02:31:07.741
<v Speaker 4>wiener.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides his obvious addictions to </v>

3079
02:31:07.741 --> 02:31:11.370
<v Speaker 4>sexting with people was a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>politician and a very good speaker and </v>

3080
02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:15.400
<v Speaker 4>he had a lot of very good quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going after bankers?</v>

3081
02:31:15.401 --> 02:31:19.440
<v Speaker 4>The same as the Eliot Spitzer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eliot Spitzer did a lot of good things.</v>

3082
02:31:19.441 --> 02:31:23.840
<v Speaker 4>He was going after the bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was going after corruption and yeah,</v>

3083
02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:26.910
<v Speaker 4>well I've said it but that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an example.</v>

3084
02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:32.490
<v Speaker 4>There's a flag planted that shows us how</v>
<v Speaker 4>far we have gone from the normal.</v>

3085
02:31:32.981 --> 02:31:37.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean Elliot Spitzer destroyed himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>with one instance of hypocrisy.</v>

3086
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3087
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:43.770
<v Speaker 4>What was pretty bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump level bad.</v>

3088
02:31:43.771 --> 02:31:46.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have.</v>

3089
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll pop in the law in this way.</v>

3090
02:31:49.261 --> 02:31:49.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

3091
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:51.870
<v Speaker 4>He was with a prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3092
02:31:51.871 --> 02:31:52.710
<v Speaker 4>that's a stupid law.</v>

3093
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:57.710
<v Speaker 4>The real problem was that he was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>after going after Ross Johnson giant.</v>

3094
02:31:58.350 --> 02:31:59.850
<v Speaker 4>That was the real problem is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypocrisy.</v>

3095
02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:03.570
<v Speaker 4>The hypocrisy wasn't that he did </v>
<v Speaker 4>something illegal where you paid someone</v>

3096
02:32:03.571 --> 02:32:08.571
<v Speaker 4>for sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that law seems to me to be so </v>

3097
02:32:08.571 --> 02:32:09.150
<v Speaker 4>archaic and so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could pay someone to massage you,</v>

3098
02:32:09.151 --> 02:32:10.860
<v Speaker 4>you can't pay someone to touch your </v>
<v Speaker 4>genitals.</v>

3099
02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:16.040
<v Speaker 4>It seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I guess the other piece you have to </v>

3100
02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:20.000
<v Speaker 4>put in play there is that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are some percentage of people </v>

3101
02:32:20.011 --> 02:32:25.011
<v Speaker 4>working in the sex trade who are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it voluntarily or coerced to one </v>

3102
02:32:25.011 --> 02:32:26.250
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a horror show.</v>

3103
02:32:26.251 --> 02:32:28.800
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of the problem with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it's illegal.</v>

3104
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:30.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the big argument is that,</v>

3105
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:32.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes there is.</v>

3106
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:36.180
<v Speaker 4>There is that argument and I agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you that,</v>

3107
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:39.360
<v Speaker 4>that it consenting adults should be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do what they want to do,</v>

3108
02:32:39.361 --> 02:32:44.361
<v Speaker 4>but the coop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the crucial variable there is </v>

3109
02:32:44.361 --> 02:32:44.361
<v Speaker 4>consent and.</v>

3110
02:32:45.180 --> 02:32:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>

3111
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3112
02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:52.480
<v Speaker 4>I just think that someone is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be dynamic.</v>

3113
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:57.950
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to engage people </v>

3114
02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:01.440
<v Speaker 4>in a way that they're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with his attacks.</v>

3115
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:06.500
<v Speaker 4>It's case or maybe what's people will be</v>
<v Speaker 4>thirsting for after after four years is </v>

3116
02:33:06.930 --> 02:33:09.420
<v Speaker 4>a is actually blend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3117
02:33:09.421 --> 02:33:10.620
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe right?</v>

3118
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do with land right now.</v>

3119
02:33:13.730 --> 02:33:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Fantastic blend at blanded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually super religious would be the </v>

3120
02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:22.050
<v Speaker 4>might be happy for Ted Cruz and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>blend.</v>

3121
02:33:22.250 --> 02:33:27.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my enthusiasm for impeachment </v>

3122
02:33:27.250 --> 02:33:27.250
<v Speaker 4>suggests that I'm happy with pence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3123
02:33:27.250 --> 02:33:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Like so like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I could find the impeachment button,</v>

3124
02:33:30.090 --> 02:33:32.970
<v Speaker 4>I would not hesitate to suppress it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And pence,</v>

3125
02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 4>given his religious commitments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3126
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:38.700
<v Speaker 4>a few short years ago would've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>among my worst nightmares.</v>

3127
02:33:38.701 --> 02:33:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would be talking about the rise</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Christian.</v>

3128
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:46.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the danger of theocracy and I mean </v>

3129
02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:49.140
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a psychologically he seems like</v>

3130
02:33:49.290 --> 02:33:51.360
<v Speaker 4>a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>predictable,</v>

3131
02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:56.720
<v Speaker 4>solid American compared to what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't the other question like trump's </v>

3132
02:33:59.221 --> 02:34:01.500
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a 70 year old man.</v>

3133
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:04.500
<v Speaker 4>People don't really live that much past </v>
<v Speaker 4>70,</v>

3134
02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:09.980
<v Speaker 4>especially people that are overweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people that don't exercise all to </v>

3135
02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:12.580
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that campaign was,</v>

3136
02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:15.810
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's his energy and his credit.</v>

3137
02:34:15.811 --> 02:34:20.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's an amazing thing to be </v>

3138
02:34:20.811 --> 02:34:22.861
<v Speaker 4>able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you think it's most punishing </v>

3139
02:34:22.861 --> 02:34:22.861
<v Speaker 4>thing in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine.</v>

3140
02:34:22.861 --> 02:34:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Schedule is always having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously did and in that press </v>

3141
02:34:29.341 --> 02:34:30.810
<v Speaker 3>conference we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 77,</v>

3142
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 77 minutes press </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference.</v>

3143
02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.950
<v Speaker 3>He looked like he was having a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3144
02:34:35.370 --> 02:34:36.870
<v Speaker 3>he gets like he gets really energized.</v>

3145
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>

3146
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:42.890
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be the most punishing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat down ever if you're,</v>

3147
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:47.270
<v Speaker 4>if you're not designed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can't imagine how tiring.</v>

3148
02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:52.430
<v Speaker 3>I'd never done a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you get exhausted for 30 minutes </v>

3149
02:34:52.430 --> 02:34:52.430
<v Speaker 3>of looking at your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at mentions</v>

3150
02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:56.850
<v Speaker 4>now you have to be wired differently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3151
02:34:56.890 --> 02:35:01.890
<v Speaker 4>he clearly is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he's wired that way.</v>

3152
02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:07.940
<v Speaker 4>It's worked for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you need someone who's willing to </v>

3153
02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:10.401
<v Speaker 4>submit to the punishment of running and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a rare person or it's not.</v>

3154
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:15.830
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is that kind of selects </v>
<v Speaker 4>or things that you don't actually want </v>

3155
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:18.810
<v Speaker 4>in a president or at least I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think you would want.</v>

3156
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:23.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Aleks for kind of narcissism and a </v>

3157
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:24.780
<v Speaker 4>sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that really has to be you,</v>

3158
02:35:24.810 --> 02:35:25.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

3159
02:35:25.650 --> 02:35:30.650
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't select for the normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual space.</v>

3160
02:35:31.531 --> 02:35:33.220
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly aware,</v>

3161
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:38.280
<v Speaker 4>aware of the ways in which you are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best guy or gal to be doing the </v>

3162
02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:38.280
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3163
02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Like you want to defer to experts and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

3164
02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:44.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump is only I can fix it,</v>

3165
02:35:44.250 --> 02:35:45.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that worked.</v>

3166
02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:50.870
<v Speaker 4>And so you need something of that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>creeps into the,</v>

3167
02:35:51.091 --> 02:35:56.091
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the headspace of most politicians it </v>

3168
02:35:56.091 --> 02:35:56.091
<v Speaker 4>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3169
02:35:56.091 --> 02:35:56.210
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3170
02:35:56.330 --> 02:36:01.330
<v Speaker 4>so scientific humility and I'm just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a sense of the limits of,</v>

3171
02:36:03.201 --> 02:36:08.201
<v Speaker 4>of any one person's expertise is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily the right piece of software </v>

3172
02:36:08.521 --> 02:36:12.090
<v Speaker 4>to have running at when it comes time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>run for president.</v>

3173
02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Now I wanna switch gears a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3174
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:18.070
<v Speaker 5>it's not totally related,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is in somewhat in some ways,</v>

3175
02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:23.580
<v Speaker 5>headspace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about mindsets and talking </v>

3176
02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:27.181
<v Speaker 5>about like we've brought this up but </v>
<v Speaker 5>really haven't delved into it much at </v>

3177
02:36:27.181 --> 02:36:31.171
<v Speaker 5>all about meditation and about how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's affected you and how it got you </v>

3178
02:36:31.171 --> 02:36:35.551
<v Speaker 5>back on track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know that you're a big proponent </v>

3179
02:36:35.551 --> 02:36:37.471
<v Speaker 5>of it and I am as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although I think I'd probably do it </v>

3180
02:36:37.471 --> 02:36:40.951
<v Speaker 5>differently than you guys do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'd love to hear how you do it by </v>

3181
02:36:40.951 --> 02:36:42.000
<v Speaker 5>using an isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

3182
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:44.190
<v Speaker 5>Like a sensory deprivation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3183
02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:46.660
<v Speaker 5>And I do a lot of yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are,</v>

3184
02:36:46.661 --> 02:36:48.850
<v Speaker 5>those are two big ones for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3185
02:36:48.851 --> 02:36:53.530
<v Speaker 5>I think those alone have straightened </v>
<v Speaker 5>out my brain in a great way.</v>

3186
02:36:53.531 --> 02:36:55.000
<v Speaker 5>Yoga in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoga,</v>

3187
02:36:55.001 --> 02:36:55.880
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3188
02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:01.040
<v Speaker 5>it's not yoga forces you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're either doing it or you're not </v>

3189
02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:03.670
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no room for distraction.</v>

3190
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:04.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3191
02:37:04.341 --> 02:37:08.500
<v Speaker 5>you're essentially forced to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>what these poses require of you.</v>

3192
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:13.830
<v Speaker 5>And I think that in doing so and having </v>
<v Speaker 5>a singular focus of trying to maintain </v>

3193
02:37:14.771 --> 02:37:18.250
<v Speaker 5>your and stretch and extend and do all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different things while you do it,</v>

3194
02:37:18.251 --> 02:37:20.450
<v Speaker 5>then concentrating almost entirely on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your breath,</v>

3195
02:37:20.451 --> 02:37:25.451
<v Speaker 5>which is a big factor in yoga that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>has remarkable brain scrubbing </v>

3196
02:37:26.301 --> 02:37:27.790
<v Speaker 5>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3197
02:37:28.210 --> 02:37:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know much before I say this,</v>

3198
02:37:32.171 --> 02:37:37.171
<v Speaker 3>let me just ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing in the isolation </v>

3199
02:37:37.171 --> 02:37:39.421
<v Speaker 3>tank?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing in your mind a </v>

3200
02:37:39.421 --> 02:37:39.421
<v Speaker 3>lot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3201
02:37:39.421 --> 02:37:39.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you use it for</v>

3202
02:37:39.421 --> 02:37:40.410
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways.</v>

3203
02:37:41.130 --> 02:37:42.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't use it as much as I should </v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly.</v>

3204
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:47.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I concentrate on and sometimes I go </v>

3205
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:51.651
<v Speaker 5>in there with an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'll concentrate on material like </v>

3206
02:37:51.651 --> 02:37:53.280
<v Speaker 5>that I'm working on or maybe Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques that I'm having problems with</v>

3207
02:37:53.730 --> 02:37:56.610
<v Speaker 5>or some other things I'm dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3208
02:37:56.611 --> 02:37:57.960
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any sort of issues that I have.</v>

3209
02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I do that sometimes it just go</v>
<v Speaker 5>in there and chill out and relax and </v>

3210
02:38:02.980 --> 02:38:06.561
<v Speaker 5>breathe and concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of physical things that </v>

3211
02:38:06.561 --> 02:38:09.381
<v Speaker 5>happen inside the tank is the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnesium in the water because it's </v>

3212
02:38:09.751 --> 02:38:12.120
<v Speaker 5>epsom salts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really good for you physically.</v>

3213
02:38:12.121 --> 02:38:17.121
<v Speaker 5>It's very good for the muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It loosens you up and relaxes you and </v>

3214
02:38:17.121 --> 02:38:19.881
<v Speaker 5>that eliminates a lot of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that physical elimination of stress </v>

3215
02:38:19.881 --> 02:38:24.171
<v Speaker 5>allows the brain to function with just </v>
<v Speaker 5>less pressure and allows you to relax </v>

3216
02:38:24.991 --> 02:38:26.670
<v Speaker 5>more and put things in perspective </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

3217
02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.820
<v Speaker 5>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gives you this environment that's not</v>

3218
02:38:29.821 --> 02:38:33.300
<v Speaker 5>available anywhere else in the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This weightless floating,</v>

3219
02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:36.330
<v Speaker 5>disconnected from your body environment </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're.</v>

3220
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:38.430
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see anything,</v>

3221
02:38:38.431 --> 02:38:40.140
<v Speaker 5>you don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel like you're weightless.</v>

3222
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:45.150
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have this sensation of flying </v>

3223
02:38:45.150 --> 02:38:46.920
<v Speaker 5>because you're totally weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weightless in the dark.</v>

3224
02:38:46.921 --> 02:38:48.600
<v Speaker 5>You Open your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see anything,</v>

3225
02:38:48.601 --> 02:38:50.310
<v Speaker 5>you close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly the same.</v>

3226
02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:54.480
<v Speaker 5>The water's the same temperature as your</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin so you don't feel the water and you</v>

3227
02:38:54.481 --> 02:38:54.930
<v Speaker 5>floating.</v>

3228
02:38:55.590 --> 02:39:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how this is going to have </v>

3229
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:02.130
<v Speaker 3>to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't have any questions </v>

3230
02:39:02.130 --> 02:39:02.130
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3231
02:39:02.130 --> 02:39:05.610
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of being in an isolation </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank even though I don't know too much </v>

3232
02:39:05.610 --> 02:39:07.370
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also am a PR.</v>

3233
02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I think yoga is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I don't do much of it myself.</v>

3234
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think though that there may actually </v>

3235
02:39:15.610 --> 02:39:17.931
<v Speaker 3>be a difference between those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>activities and meditation because it a </v>

3236
02:39:17.931 --> 02:39:22.401
<v Speaker 3>kind of highfalutin term metacognition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of knowing what you know or knowing</v>

3237
02:39:23.851 --> 02:39:28.851
<v Speaker 3>that you're thinking that happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of mindfulness meditation of which,</v>

3238
02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:31.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam and I are proponents proponents that</v>

3239
02:39:31.741 --> 02:39:36.450
<v Speaker 3>I think is a different thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing.</v>

3240
02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'll just try to put this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>

3241
02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:41.280
<v Speaker 3>When you're meditating the way we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing how crazy you are.</v>

3242
02:39:41.310 --> 02:39:42.510
<v Speaker 3>You're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking nuts,</v>

3243
02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:45.000
<v Speaker 3>and that actually has a real value.</v>

3244
02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Is systematic collision with the asshole</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head has a real value because </v>

3245
02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.030
<v Speaker 3>when the asshole offers you up a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggestion in the rest of your life,</v>

3246
02:39:54.031 --> 02:39:57.120
<v Speaker 3>which is basically it's job like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3247
02:39:57.121 --> 02:40:02.121
<v Speaker 3>you should eat the 17th cookie or say </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's going to ruin the next </v>

3248
02:40:02.121 --> 02:40:04.560
<v Speaker 3>48 hours of your marriage or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're better able to resist it.</v>

3249
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:06.270
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you do?</v>

3250
02:40:06.390 --> 02:40:09.840
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the basic steps of mindfulness</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation or to sit.</v>

3251
02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Most people close their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bring your full attention,</v>

3252
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:14.850
<v Speaker 3>the feeling of your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>

3253
02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.960
<v Speaker 3>you're not thinking about your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just feeling the raw data of the </v>

3254
02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:22.740
<v Speaker 3>physical sensations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the third step is the Biggie,</v>

3255
02:40:22.770 --> 02:40:25.470
<v Speaker 3>which is as soon as you try to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind's going to go bonkers.</v>

3256
02:40:25.471 --> 02:40:27.770
<v Speaker 3>You're going to start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's for lunch to an eight,</v>

3257
02:40:27.771 --> 02:40:30.540
<v Speaker 3>a haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did your bills run wild,</v>

3258
02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:31.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3259
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:31.710
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3260
02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:33.900
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3261
02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm my mind's going crazy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that noticing is the key moment is </v>

3262
02:40:39.010 --> 02:40:42.861
<v Speaker 3>the fact that victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because this is when </v>

3263
02:40:42.861 --> 02:40:43.220
<v Speaker 3>most people think they failed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

3264
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:48.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't meditate because I can't clear </v>

3265
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.230
<v Speaker 3>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

3266
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.780
<v Speaker 3>the biggest misconception about </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>

3267
02:40:48.781 --> 02:40:53.781
<v Speaker 3>You do not need to clear your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's impossible unless you're </v>

3268
02:40:53.781 --> 02:40:53.850
<v Speaker 3>enlightened or dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3269
02:40:53.851 --> 02:40:58.851
<v Speaker 3>the whole goal is just to notice when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've become distracted and start </v>

3270
02:40:58.851 --> 02:40:58.851
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You return your attention to your breath</v>

3271
02:40:59.010 --> 02:41:04.010
<v Speaker 3>and you just do that a million times and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time you catch yourself wondering </v>

3272
02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:05.970
<v Speaker 3>and go back to your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bicep curl for your brain.</v>

3273
02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:11.420
<v Speaker 3>It changes your brain and that over time</v>
<v Speaker 3>creates the kind of Meta cognition I was</v>

3274
02:41:13.711 --> 02:41:18.711
<v Speaker 3>discussing before where you see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a homo sapiens sapiens another </v>

3275
02:41:18.711 --> 02:41:19.080
<v Speaker 3>word zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3276
02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:21.000
<v Speaker 3>that's how we're classified as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>

3277
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:26.330
<v Speaker 3>the one who thinks and knows he or she </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks and that just that knowing that </v>

3278
02:41:26.971 --> 02:41:29.310
<v Speaker 3>you have this voice in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3279
02:41:29.350 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 3>as Sam likes to joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he feels like when he thinks about the </v>

3280
02:41:34.350 --> 02:41:37.731
<v Speaker 3>voice in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he feels like he's been hijacked by the </v>

3281
02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:37.731
<v Speaker 3>most boring person alive.</v>

3282
02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Just says the same shit over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

3283
02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:42.630
<v Speaker 3>a joke that I deal from them all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3284
02:41:42.631 --> 02:41:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3285
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.130
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is enormously powerful because then</v>

3286
02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:49.260
<v Speaker 3>you are not held hostage by this voice.</v>

3287
02:41:49.970 --> 02:41:52.090
<v Speaker 2>A similar thing happens in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3288
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I do a do a form of meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tank.</v>

3289
02:41:54.981 --> 02:41:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I go in there with or </v>
<v Speaker 2>without an idea,</v>

3290
02:41:57.291 --> 02:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm not working on material or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else where I just concentrating</v>

3291
02:42:00.591 --> 02:42:02.930
<v Speaker 2>on my breath in through the nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out through the mouth,</v>

3292
02:42:02.931 --> 02:42:04.790
<v Speaker 2>and I just literally concentrate on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath.</v>

3293
02:42:04.791 --> 02:42:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

3294
02:42:07.420 --> 02:42:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's similar,</v>

3295
02:42:10.010 --> 02:42:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it's the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference is in the tank.</v>

3296
02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:16.220
<v Speaker 2>After Awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after about 20 minutes or so,</v>

3297
02:42:16.221 --> 02:42:19.910
<v Speaker 2>that breaks loose to psychedelic states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3298
02:42:20.170 --> 02:42:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever combined the tank with </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics?</v>

3299
02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Altered state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

3300
02:42:23.860 --> 02:42:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweat trip.</v>

3301
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:27.830
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>LSD or mushrooms?</v>

3302
02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the big one is edible pot.</v>

3303
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Edible pod seems to be as strong as </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in there.</v>

3304
02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I've got enough pot where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced I'm going to die,</v>

3305
02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:38.600
<v Speaker 2>then I climb in there and every time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it I go,</v>

3306
02:42:38.601 --> 02:42:40.700
<v Speaker 2>don't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just get out.</v>

3307
02:42:40.701 --> 02:42:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So terrified</v>

3308
02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.220
<v Speaker 3>your motivation when you're eating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pot and climbing into.</v>

3309
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:46.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3310
02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be scared.</v>

3311
02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3312
02:42:49.381 --> 02:42:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Because nothing ever happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never die,</v>

3313
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:57.190
<v Speaker 2>but God damn you just convinced that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe is imploding around you and </v>

3314
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:59.120
<v Speaker 2>that it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it usually has the,</v>

3315
02:42:59.190 --> 02:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>the character of fear being part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also not embracing the fear,</v>

3316
02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:09.960
<v Speaker 2>not letting the fear run rampant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of relaxing and giving into </v>

3317
02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:10.580
<v Speaker 2>the vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3318
02:43:10.581 --> 02:43:12.580
<v Speaker 2>the finite of your existence</v>

3319
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.860
<v Speaker 5>and just breathing and concentrating and</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting.</v>

3320
02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Letting the dance take place because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some.</v>

3321
02:43:17.411 --> 02:43:22.411
<v Speaker 5>There's some sort of a weird that one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the things that there's a big </v>

3322
02:43:22.411 --> 02:43:23.380
<v Speaker 5>misconception about when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>edible pot,</v>

3323
02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:27.100
<v Speaker 5>is it edible pod is like smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an entirely different process.</v>

3324
02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:30.940
<v Speaker 5>Physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your liver time course is very different</v>

3325
02:43:30.941 --> 02:43:32.800
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can stay stolen for three days.</v>

3326
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:33.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

3327
02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:38.790
<v Speaker 5>you could fuck up and eat too many </v>
<v Speaker 5>brownies and you'll be gone for a long </v>

3328
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:39.640
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds miserable.</v>

3329
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:44.790
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not because he gets something </v>

3330
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:46.120
<v Speaker 5>out of it when it's over the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The process is excruciating,</v>

3331
02:43:46.121 --> 02:43:48.840
<v Speaker 5>but when you come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just feel so happy.</v>

3332
02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:50.290
<v Speaker 5>Feel so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

3333
02:43:50.470 --> 02:43:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Is it like the joke about the dude is </v>
<v Speaker 3>banging his head up against the wall and</v>

3334
02:43:54.401 --> 02:43:55.500
<v Speaker 3>somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing that?</v>

3335
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it feels so good when I stopped</v>

3336
02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 5>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no physical damage banging </v>

3337
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 5>your head up against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to hurt yourself.</v>

3338
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 5>This is true.</v>

3339
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3340
02:44:04.421 --> 02:44:09.421
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there seems like there might be </v>

3341
02:44:09.421 --> 02:44:09.421
<v Speaker 3>easier ways to get to the same wisdom.</v>

3342
02:44:09.421 --> 02:44:12.990
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's also creativity that</v>

3343
02:44:12.991 --> 02:44:17.991
<v Speaker 5>gets inspired by the edible pot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something called 11 hydroxy metabolite </v>

3344
02:44:18.661 --> 02:44:23.661
<v Speaker 5>that your body produces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so different than most people when </v>

3345
02:44:23.661 --> 02:44:26.751
<v Speaker 5>they eat pot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think they been dosed like anybody </v>

3346
02:44:26.751 --> 02:44:27.210
<v Speaker 5>who smoked pot before and then you give </v>
<v Speaker 5>them a Brownie.</v>

3347
02:44:27.211 --> 02:44:27.840
<v Speaker 5>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3348
02:44:27.841 --> 02:44:32.841
<v Speaker 5>there something in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're convinced because reality </v>

3349
02:44:32.841 --> 02:44:35.250
<v Speaker 5>itself just seems like it just dissolves</v>
<v Speaker 5>and especially inside the tank,</v>

3350
02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:37.890
<v Speaker 5>there's something about the tank </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment that produces.</v>

3351
02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:43.280
<v Speaker 5>In the absence of any external stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your brain becomes sort of supercharged </v>

3352
02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:48.860
<v Speaker 5>because what you're trying to do when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just sitting down and </v>

3353
02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:50.790
<v Speaker 5>concentrating and relaxing as you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to focus on your thoughts,</v>

3354
02:44:50.791 --> 02:44:55.791
<v Speaker 5>but you're still aware of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're still aware of your elbows </v>

3355
02:44:55.791 --> 02:44:55.980
<v Speaker 5>touching this desk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your butt touching the chair.</v>

3356
02:44:55.981 --> 02:44:58.290
<v Speaker 5>There's all these different factors that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are that are.</v>

3357
02:44:58.410 --> 02:45:01.890
<v Speaker 5>There's stimuli that's coming into your </v>
<v Speaker 5>senses.</v>

3358
02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:05.160
<v Speaker 5>Whereas in the tank there's none of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>virtually.</v>

3359
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:07.290
<v Speaker 5>It's almost completely eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>

3360
02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.670
<v Speaker 5>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>

3361
02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.000
<v Speaker 5>You could phase that stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could still feel the water a </v>

3362
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:14.000
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you think about it,</v>

3363
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.710
<v Speaker 5>you could still use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you bump into the wall and you</v>

3364
02:45:16.711 --> 02:45:20.460
<v Speaker 5>have to like center yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to relax again and make sure you're</v>

3365
02:45:20.461 --> 02:45:25.461
<v Speaker 5>not moving so you don't touch things </v>
<v Speaker 5>which can kind of dissolve the </v>

3366
02:45:25.461 --> 02:45:27.290
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their experiences,</v>

3367
02:45:27.330 --> 02:45:32.330
<v Speaker 5>meditation where you have that same </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience where you lose your sense of </v>

3368
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:36.110
<v Speaker 5>the body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that usually comes with more </v>

3369
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.900
<v Speaker 5>concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be very concentrated on it.</v>

3370
02:45:37.050 --> 02:45:42.050
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you would have that </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience and it would be even more </v>

3371
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:45.981
<v Speaker 5>intense if you did the exact same thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you do outside the tank in the </v>

3372
02:45:45.981 --> 02:45:45.981
<v Speaker 5>tank.</v>

3373
02:45:45.981 --> 02:45:46.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you need any psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the tangle.</v>

3374
02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing that I tell people when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they ask me,</v>

3375
02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:50.880
<v Speaker 5>should I get high before I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3376
02:45:50.881 --> 02:45:51.930
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just do it.</v>

3377
02:45:52.470 --> 02:45:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you decide after a while,</v>

3378
02:45:54.441 --> 02:45:55.820
<v Speaker 5>if you've done it three or four times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you was like,</v>

3379
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:58.950
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what it's like if I just take a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit of a hit of pot and see where</v>

3380
02:45:58.951 --> 02:46:00.670
<v Speaker 5>it takes me and there's nothing wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

3381
02:46:00.671 --> 02:46:05.671
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you're a type of person who </v>

3382
02:46:05.671 --> 02:46:08.151
<v Speaker 5>enjoys marijuana or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the tank alone by itself,</v>

3383
02:46:08.221 --> 02:46:10.280
<v Speaker 5>just the absence of sensory input,</v>

3384
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:15.310
<v Speaker 4>your brain goes to a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different place and as long as you </v>

3385
02:46:15.310 --> 02:46:18.491
<v Speaker 4>can relax and as long as you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much about the fact that you're in </v>

3386
02:46:18.491 --> 02:46:22.781
<v Speaker 4>the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just concentrate entirely on your </v>

3387
02:46:22.781 --> 02:46:22.781
<v Speaker 4>thoughts entirely on your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

3388
02:46:22.781 --> 02:46:25.970
<v Speaker 4>let all those crazy like where to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hamsters live like all that shit.</v>

3389
02:46:26.330 --> 02:46:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Let let all that stuff run wild through </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mouth,</v>

3390
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:32.170
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like in the tank at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>that gets to a certain spot.</v>

3391
02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Then it stops existing and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic state takes over.</v>

3392
02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it depends on what the goal is.</v>

3393
02:46:38.151 --> 02:46:43.151
<v Speaker 4>I think there can be many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>goals of meditation or quasi spiritual </v>

3394
02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:49.010
<v Speaker 4>practice and they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're distinct.</v>

3395
02:46:49.011 --> 02:46:54.011
<v Speaker 4>So the center of the Bullseye for me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not suffering unnecessarily.</v>

3396
02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

3397
02:46:56.811 --> 02:47:01.811
<v Speaker 4>And so one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mindfulness gives you is so it's </v>

3398
02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:07.760
<v Speaker 4>potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's compatible with every experience </v>

3399
02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:07.760
<v Speaker 4>you can have.</v>

3400
02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:12.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's is nothing in your experience </v>

3401
02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:12.280
<v Speaker 4>that isn't inappropriate object of </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation.</v>

3402
02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:16.181
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people start with the breath </v>

3403
02:47:16.181 --> 02:47:16.181
<v Speaker 4>because it's just a very convenient </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to start with,</v>

3404
02:47:16.181 --> 02:47:18.860
<v Speaker 4>but once you know how to do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular practice,</v>

3405
02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.720
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your goal is to just be clearly aware of</v>

3406
02:47:23.721 --> 02:47:25.760
<v Speaker 4>whatever your experience is in each </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

3407
02:47:25.761 --> 02:47:28.790
<v Speaker 4>So it's emotions arise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts arise,</v>

3408
02:47:28.791 --> 02:47:33.791
<v Speaker 4>sounds come in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your attention is wide open to whatever </v>

3409
02:47:34.401 --> 02:47:36.320
<v Speaker 4>your experience is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like.</v>

3410
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:38.600
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing in principle is a distraction.</v>

3411
02:47:38.601 --> 02:47:43.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can be meditating right next to a </v>

3412
02:47:43.601 --> 02:47:45.131
<v Speaker 4>construction site and the sound of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammers is just as good and object of </v>

3413
02:47:45.561 --> 02:47:47.630
<v Speaker 4>meditation as the breath or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

3414
02:47:47.631 --> 02:47:49.070
<v Speaker 4>So there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is included,</v>

3415
02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:51.580
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3416
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:57.130
<v Speaker 4>the superpower you're after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you actually can acquire through </v>

3417
02:47:57.561 --> 02:48:02.561
<v Speaker 4>this practice is to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtually all of your,</v>

3418
02:48:03.770 --> 02:48:08.150
<v Speaker 4>of your psychological suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually arguably,</v>

3419
02:48:08.151 --> 02:48:13.151
<v Speaker 4>virtually all of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your physical suffering or the </v>

3420
02:48:13.151 --> 02:48:14.750
<v Speaker 4>difference between physical pain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering,</v>

3421
02:48:14.810 --> 02:48:16.940
<v Speaker 4>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those two are not quite the same thing.</v>

3422
02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a matter of being lost in thought as </v>

3423
02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:23.540
<v Speaker 4>a matter of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without knowing that you're thinking and</v>

3424
02:48:23.541 --> 02:48:28.541
<v Speaker 4>what and what mindfulness does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And really any technique of meditation </v>

3425
02:48:28.541 --> 02:48:32.480
<v Speaker 4>ultimately should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is teach you to break the spell of being</v>

3426
02:48:32.481 --> 02:48:35.720
<v Speaker 4>lost in thought and to notice a thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a thought.</v>

3427
02:48:35.721 --> 02:48:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3428
02:48:36.330 --> 02:48:41.330
<v Speaker 4>the huge difference is until you learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to meditate or do something like </v>

3429
02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:45.431
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just helplessly thinking every </v>

3430
02:48:45.431 --> 02:48:48.821
<v Speaker 4>moment of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're having a conversation with </v>

3431
02:48:48.821 --> 02:48:48.821
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're having content,</v>

3432
02:48:48.821 --> 02:48:50.210
<v Speaker 4>whether it's images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stick or linguistic,</v>

3433
02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.890
<v Speaker 4>poor forth into consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every moment and so incessantly that you</v>

3434
02:48:54.891 --> 02:48:56.660
<v Speaker 4>don't even notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just white noise.</v>

3435
02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:02.440
<v Speaker 4>And not only does it completely color </v>
<v Speaker 4>your experience moment to moment.</v>

3436
02:49:03.471 --> 02:49:04.940
<v Speaker 4>So like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're angry thoughts,</v>

3437
02:49:04.941 --> 02:49:09.941
<v Speaker 4>you're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're depressed thoughts or you're </v>

3438
02:49:09.941 --> 02:49:09.941
<v Speaker 4>depressed or sad that you're sad.</v>

3439
02:49:09.941 --> 02:49:12.150
<v Speaker 4>So you become your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also feel,</v>

3440
02:49:12.990 --> 02:49:14.700
<v Speaker 4>you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel identified,</v>

3441
02:49:14.701 --> 02:49:17.130
<v Speaker 4>you feel that you are the thinker of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts.</v>

3442
02:49:17.131 --> 02:49:21.020
<v Speaker 4>You feel like a self and it's completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>structured by this flow of,</v>

3443
02:49:21.021 --> 02:49:26.021
<v Speaker 4>of mentation every moment and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces everything you do.</v>

3444
02:49:26.461 --> 02:49:29.160
<v Speaker 4>It produces all of your intentions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your goals and your actions,</v>

3445
02:49:29.161 --> 02:49:31.530
<v Speaker 4>and he said this about me and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to say that.</v>

3446
02:49:31.531 --> 02:49:36.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like it's everything coming out </v>

3447
02:49:36.531 --> 02:49:38.091
<v Speaker 4>of you is born of of this same process </v>
<v Speaker 4>and meditation is a way of recognizing </v>

3448
02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:45.920
<v Speaker 4>that consciousness and then what you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>subjectively as a prior condition of </v>

3449
02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:47.670
<v Speaker 4>just be awareness in which everything is</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing up,</v>

3450
02:49:47.671 --> 02:49:51.840
<v Speaker 4>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensations and thoughts and thoughts can</v>

3451
02:49:51.841 --> 02:49:56.841
<v Speaker 4>become just other objects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and I'm so I'm going to </v>

3452
02:49:57.511 --> 02:49:58.060
<v Speaker 4>take eva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eva,</v>

3453
02:49:58.110 --> 02:50:03.110
<v Speaker 4>at a very basic example of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between between pain and </v>

3454
02:50:03.871 --> 02:50:04.440
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

3455
02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:09.980
<v Speaker 4>You can feel very strong physical pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean unpleasant pain and just be aware</v>

3456
02:50:14.011 --> 02:50:19.011
<v Speaker 4>of it in that sense that it's unbearable</v>
<v Speaker 4>is virtually always untrue because you </v>

3457
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.760
<v Speaker 4>in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've already born it,</v>

3458
02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:21.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That may,</v>

3459
02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:26.460
<v Speaker 4>that the feeling that something's </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbearable is really the fear of having </v>

3460
02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:28.710
<v Speaker 4>to experience it in the next moment in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future.</v>

3461
02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're almost like if some.</v>

3462
02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:32.880
<v Speaker 4>If someone drives a nail into your knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3463
02:50:32.881 --> 02:50:33.920
<v Speaker 4>You might only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>

3464
02:50:34.270 --> 02:50:38.190
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like it's unbearable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every moment you're feeling it,</v>

3465
02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:40.020
<v Speaker 4>you're burying it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3466
02:50:40.021 --> 02:50:40.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3467
02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:45.520
<v Speaker 4>it's what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're thinking about is the last </v>

3468
02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:48.201
<v Speaker 4>moment and the next moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're thinking about how much you </v>

3469
02:50:48.201 --> 02:50:51.001
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when am I going to get some relief and </v>

3470
02:50:51.001 --> 02:50:51.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the cure and how badly is my knee</v>

3471
02:50:51.001 --> 02:50:51.700
<v Speaker 4>injured?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3472
02:50:51.730 --> 02:50:52.140
<v Speaker 4>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3473
02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're worried about the future </v>

3474
02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:57.990
<v Speaker 4>continuously and you're not noticing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>automaticity of thought that is,</v>

3475
02:50:58.020 --> 02:51:01.080
<v Speaker 4>that is amplifying the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3476
02:51:01.230 --> 02:51:06.230
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the negative negativity of the </v>

3477
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:06.230
<v Speaker 4>experience in that moment.</v>

3478
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:09.680
<v Speaker 4>And we all know that you can have super </v>
<v Speaker 4>intense sensation which is either either</v>

3479
02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:17.660
<v Speaker 4>pleasant or unpleasant depending on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the conceptual frame you've put </v>

3480
02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:17.660
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

3481
02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:22.551
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had this massive sense of </v>

3482
02:51:22.551 --> 02:51:27.111
<v Speaker 4>soreness in your shoulder that you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience it very differently if it was</v>

3483
02:51:27.961 --> 02:51:30.900
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the result of you dead lifting more than</v>

3484
02:51:30.901 --> 02:51:32.970
<v Speaker 4>you ever had in your life and you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>proud of it,</v>

3485
02:51:33.090 --> 02:51:37.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be probably cancer.</v>

3486
02:51:37.201 --> 02:51:38.310
<v Speaker 4>And you're waiting for your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3487
02:51:38.311 --> 02:51:39.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biopsy results.</v>

3488
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:40.500
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3489
02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:41.280
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3490
02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:43.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're worried about this is the thing,</v>

3491
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:48.630
<v Speaker 4>the thing is going to kill you or you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting raw for some deep tissue massage</v>

3492
02:51:48.781 --> 02:51:53.781
<v Speaker 4>and it hurts like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you actually totally understand the </v>

3493
02:51:53.781 --> 02:51:55.110
<v Speaker 4>source of the pain and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be gone the moment the guy</v>

3494
02:51:55.111 --> 02:51:56.490
<v Speaker 4>pulls his elbow back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3495
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:59.940
<v Speaker 4>So it could be the exact same sensation </v>
<v Speaker 4>each one of those,</v>

3496
02:51:59.941 --> 02:52:04.941
<v Speaker 4>but the conceptual frame you have around</v>
<v Speaker 4>it totally dictates the level of </v>

3497
02:52:04.941 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 4>psychological suffering and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the or</v>

3498
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.530
<v Speaker 2>the can dictate the total absence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological suffering.</v>

3499
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Now we were talking before the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>started about your apps and we were </v>

3500
02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.760
<v Speaker 2>talking about the amount of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation exercises on the APP.</v>

3501
02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:21.760
<v Speaker 2>So like what kind of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation exercises are there?</v>

3502
02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.000
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about just </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on mindfulness and </v>

3503
02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:27.000
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>

3504
02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:27.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it turns out,</v>

3505
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you can iterate off of that basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise a in some to,</v>

3506
02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:37.240
<v Speaker 3>to like a infinity essentially because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about not only will I lose my,</v>

3507
02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get too ahead of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically the,</v>

3508
02:52:43.471 --> 02:52:48.471
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basic instructions are that we </v>

3509
02:52:48.471 --> 02:52:48.471
<v Speaker 3>listed before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're feeling your breath coming in and</v>

3510
02:52:48.471 --> 02:52:49.800
<v Speaker 3>then when you get lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start again,</v>

3511
02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:55.070
<v Speaker 3>but then you can add onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one big thing to add on is something </v>

3512
02:52:55.231 --> 02:52:59.580
<v Speaker 3>called mental noting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're breathing in and out,</v>

3513
02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:04.640
<v Speaker 3>you're feeling your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you get distracted by a huge </v>

3514
02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:04.640
<v Speaker 3>wave of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking,</v>

3515
02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:07.590
<v Speaker 3>when we get hit by a wave of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just inhabit the anger.</v>

3516
02:53:07.591 --> 02:53:12.591
<v Speaker 3>We become angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no buffer between the stimulus </v>

3517
02:53:12.591 --> 02:53:15.530
<v Speaker 3>and our response to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's this little technique you </v>

3518
02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:16.080
<v Speaker 3>can do of just making a little mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>note of,</v>

3519
02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's anger.</v>

3520
02:53:18.090 --> 02:53:23.090
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of objectifies the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit like pressing the </v>

3521
02:53:23.090 --> 02:53:27.021
<v Speaker 3>picture and picture button on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>remote control where the story that's </v>

3522
02:53:27.021 --> 02:53:28.080
<v Speaker 3>taken up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole frame can be seen with some,</v>

3523
02:53:28.770 --> 02:53:30.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

3524
02:53:30.930 --> 02:53:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's just one example of the little</v>

3525
02:53:33.271 --> 02:53:35.670
<v Speaker 3>techniques that you can add onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic exercise.</v>

3526
02:53:35.671 --> 02:53:40.671
<v Speaker 3>And you can go for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as we were discussing Sam's about to </v>

3527
02:53:40.671 --> 02:53:44.841
<v Speaker 3>start his meditation APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is going to be called what sent </v>

3528
02:53:44.841 --> 02:53:44.841
<v Speaker 3>waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waking up.</v>

3529
02:53:44.841 --> 02:53:46.020
<v Speaker 3>And I have mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is called 10 percent happier.</v>

3530
02:53:46.470 --> 02:53:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Sam is going to be doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching on his APP and my,</v>

3531
02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:51.330
<v Speaker 3>on my absence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a teacher.</v>

3532
02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:54.900
<v Speaker 3>We have experts coming in like Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 3>Goldstein,</v>

3533
02:53:54.901 --> 02:53:58.200
<v Speaker 3>who's again the friend of a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 3>both Sam and I,</v>

3534
02:53:58.201 --> 02:54:01.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a and you,</v>

3535
02:54:02.010 --> 02:54:07.010
<v Speaker 3>each teacher has their own emphasis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you then start talking about applied </v>

3536
02:54:07.021 --> 02:54:07.560
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>

3537
02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:11.040
<v Speaker 3>So how do I use it when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I use in my everyday life?</v>

3538
02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:14.640
<v Speaker 3>How do I use it if really what I want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do right now is,</v>

3539
02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:16.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control my eating.</v>

3540
02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:17.910
<v Speaker 3>So meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3541
02:54:17.911 --> 02:54:21.240
<v Speaker 3>we have a course on the APP that talks </v>
<v Speaker 3>about using it to not overeat.</v>

3542
02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:23.070
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrible at this,</v>

3543
02:54:23.250 --> 02:54:25.890
<v Speaker 3>but you can use your ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mindfulness,</v>

3544
02:54:25.891 --> 02:54:30.891
<v Speaker 3>your ability to know what's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head in any given moment without </v>

3545
02:54:30.891 --> 02:54:31.530
<v Speaker 3>getting carried away by it to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>overeat.</v>

3546
02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3547
02:54:32.371 --> 02:54:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm having this urge right now to eat as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did last night in entire bag of melted</v>

3548
02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:40.020
<v Speaker 3>chocolate in my hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3549
02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:45.320
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can ride that urge and not do the </v>

3550
02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:45.400
<v Speaker 3>thing that I know is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3551
02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:50.720
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a little taste of how you </v>

3552
02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:52.140
<v Speaker 3>can take meditation and bring it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>numerous directions.</v>

3553
02:54:53.970 --> 02:54:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Do</v>

3554
02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you guys feel competitive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of apps now isn't even out yet?</v>

3555
02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:00.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>

3556
02:55:00.930 --> 02:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>When he comes out and completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalize cannibalizes</v>

3557
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:08.180
<v Speaker 3>men both then yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How happy is for me 10 percent happier.</v>

3558
02:55:08.970 --> 02:55:13.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like negative 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's 10 percent of zero?</v>

3559
02:55:13.290 --> 02:55:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3560
02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think I'm of the view,</v>

3561
02:55:15.981 --> 02:55:20.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I've been in this meditation </v>

3562
02:55:20.981 --> 02:55:20.981
<v Speaker 3>APP business for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of,</v>

3563
02:55:20.981 --> 02:55:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the business model is that</v>

3564
02:55:25.101 --> 02:55:29.270
<v Speaker 3>there's just one huge app that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>uses and maybe there's some distant,</v>

3565
02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:30.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

3566
02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I actually think it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more like fast food.</v>

3567
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be a bunch of big </v>
<v Speaker 3>players and uh,</v>

3568
02:55:36.021 --> 02:55:37.970
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may switch back and forth.</v>

3569
02:55:38.350 --> 02:55:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think it's just one need a nap.</v>

3570
02:55:40.890 --> 02:55:41.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3571
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:42.110
<v Speaker 3>no you don't.</v>

3572
02:55:42.150 --> 02:55:47.150
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's useful and it's really </v>

3573
02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:49.671
<v Speaker 4>useful at any level of expertise in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in meditation and that at least this </v>

3574
02:55:49.921 --> 02:55:53.220
<v Speaker 4>kind of meditation is having someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>guide you.</v>

3575
02:55:53.250 --> 02:55:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3576
02:55:54.100 --> 02:55:58.320
<v Speaker 4>it's like a a mindfulness alarm that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly going off,</v>

3577
02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:03.400
<v Speaker 4>going off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>periodically over the course of 10 </v>

3578
02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:06.081
<v Speaker 4>minutes or 20 minutes or however long </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting and because distraction </v>

3579
02:56:06.601 --> 02:56:11.601
<v Speaker 4>is just continually the problem and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're either meditating or you're </v>

3580
02:56:11.601 --> 02:56:11.601
<v Speaker 4>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're either,</v>

3581
02:56:11.601 --> 02:56:16.581
<v Speaker 4>you're either aware of what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that moment or you're lost in </v>

3582
02:56:16.581 --> 02:56:18.540
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's true throughout your life.</v>

3583
02:56:18.541 --> 02:56:23.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're either hearing what I'm saying </v>

3584
02:56:23.541 --> 02:56:25.401
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're thinking about something else </v>

3585
02:56:25.401 --> 02:56:25.401
<v Speaker 4>and you don't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3586
02:56:25.401 --> 02:56:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Or you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're either reading the book you're </v>

3587
02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:28.500
<v Speaker 4>intending to read or your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 4>wandering.</v>

3588
02:56:28.501 --> 02:56:30.030
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to read that </v>
<v Speaker 4>paragraph again.</v>

3589
02:56:30.090 --> 02:56:32.130
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this failure to concentrate,</v>

3590
02:56:32.131 --> 02:56:35.400
<v Speaker 4>this failure to be able to focus on what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're intending to focus on.</v>

3591
02:56:35.970 --> 02:56:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Is it just this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this universal problem of human </v>

3592
02:56:40.970 --> 02:56:45.501
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so meditation trains that and other </v>

3593
02:56:46.621 --> 02:56:51.621
<v Speaker 4>benefits follow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the having a voice in your head </v>

3594
02:56:51.621 --> 02:56:55.760
<v Speaker 4>reminding you that you're even </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempting to be meditating is a very </v>

3595
02:56:56.161 --> 02:56:58.170
<v Speaker 4>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're,</v>

3596
02:56:58.200 --> 02:56:59.280
<v Speaker 4>even if it's your own voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3597
02:56:59.281 --> 02:57:03.690
<v Speaker 4>even when I'm listening to a meditation </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I recorded,</v>

3598
02:57:04.290 --> 02:57:07.590
<v Speaker 4>just my own voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it reminded me that I'm,</v>

3599
02:57:08.010 --> 02:57:12.060
<v Speaker 4>that I'm supposed to be meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works like any other voice,</v>

3600
02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:13.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's um,</v>

3601
02:57:14.390 --> 02:57:15.260
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3602
02:57:15.350 --> 02:57:19.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a feedback system that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really provide for yourself,</v>

3603
02:57:19.441 --> 02:57:20.730
<v Speaker 4>although you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously you can,</v>

3604
02:57:20.890 --> 02:57:23.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can meditate without an app and most</v>

3605
02:57:23.881 --> 02:57:24.870
<v Speaker 4>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3606
02:57:26.310 --> 02:57:28.560
<v Speaker 4>I've spent very little time meditating </v>
<v Speaker 4>with apps.</v>

3607
02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:30.300
<v Speaker 4>I just think they're very useful.</v>

3608
02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:32.540
<v Speaker 3>But you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of us started meditating.</v>

3609
02:57:32.541 --> 02:57:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I started meditating well before I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we both started pre worn around.</v>

3610
02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3611
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:41.000
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can read,</v>

3612
02:57:41.001 --> 02:57:46.001
<v Speaker 3>you can read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read a good book and learn how to </v>

3613
02:57:46.001 --> 02:57:48.461
<v Speaker 3>meditate out of the book and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically remember the basic </v>

3614
02:57:48.461 --> 02:57:49.410
<v Speaker 3>instructions and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3615
02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:54.610
<v Speaker 3>but a really is useful to have an APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for some people because one </v>

3616
02:57:54.610 --> 02:57:59.021
<v Speaker 3>of the biggest problems in meditation is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this persistent fear that you're not </v>

3617
02:57:59.021 --> 02:58:02.591
<v Speaker 3>doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to have a voice you in your ear </v>

3618
02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:08.060
<v Speaker 3>just giving you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminding you of the basic instructions </v>

3619
02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:08.850
<v Speaker 3>which are so simple but very easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget.</v>

3620
02:58:09.330 --> 02:58:10.290
<v Speaker 3>It can be very useful.</v>

3621
02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I like the idea of it being like bicep </v>
<v Speaker 2>curls for your mind.</v>

3622
02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3623
02:58:16.010 --> 02:58:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

3624
02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:22.870
<v Speaker 3>you see it in the brain scans and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>Samuel correct me where I run a foul of </v>

3625
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:27.200
<v Speaker 3>scientific accuracy here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this base,</v>

3626
02:58:27.300 --> 02:58:30.920
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this simple act of sitting,</v>

3627
02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:33.830
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to focus on one thing at a time.</v>

3628
02:58:33.831 --> 02:58:38.831
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get distracted knowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're distracted and returning to your </v>

3629
02:58:38.831 --> 02:58:41.480
<v Speaker 3>breath is changing your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

3630
02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:44.300
<v Speaker 3>you're boosting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscles.</v>

3631
02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the obviously the muscles.</v>

3632
02:58:47.211 --> 02:58:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm using a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light loosely.</v>

3633
02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:53.420
<v Speaker 3>You're boosting your focus muscle and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>many cases,</v>

3634
02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:56.390
<v Speaker 3>whether there was a study in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was done at Harvard,</v>

3635
02:58:56.640 --> 02:58:57.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that took,</v>

3636
02:58:57.411 --> 02:59:02.411
<v Speaker 3>people would never meditated before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they scanned their brains and then they </v>

3637
02:59:02.411 --> 02:59:02.600
<v Speaker 3>had them do eight weeks of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3638
02:59:02.601 --> 02:59:07.601
<v Speaker 3>a half hour a day of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end of the eight weeks they scanned </v>

3639
02:59:07.601 --> 02:59:10.181
<v Speaker 3>their brains again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they found was in the area of the </v>

3640
02:59:10.181 --> 02:59:10.760
<v Speaker 3>brain associated with self awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gray matter group,</v>

3641
02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:13.280
<v Speaker 3>and in the area of the brain associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with stress,</v>

3642
02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:16.430
<v Speaker 3>the gray matter shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is pretty compelling.</v>

3643
02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:19.710
<v Speaker 2>That is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen.</v>

3644
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:20.930
<v Speaker 2>We just did three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

3648
02:59:23.961 --> 02:59:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My pleasure.</v>

3649
02:59:27.690 --> 02:59:28.760
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

3650
02:59:28.790 --> 02:59:31.010
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go do something else.</v>

3651
02:59:44.170 --> 02:59:45.470
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
