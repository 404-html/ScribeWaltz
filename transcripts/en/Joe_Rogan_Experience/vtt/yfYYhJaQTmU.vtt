<v Speaker 1>he picked a very strange part of the journey.</v>

13
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>This is part two of the honey honey podcast,</v>

14
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>part one.</v>

15
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of alcohol and marijuana in the room,</v>

16
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.411
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>

17
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

18
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.691
<v Speaker 1>some things we're sad.</v>

19
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>We're not really sure what you said.</v>

20
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what the fuck we said after it was over.</v>

21
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we okay?</v>

22
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Did they do anything wrong?</v>

23
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Give us another chance.</v>

24
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.141
<v Speaker 1>But a,</v>

25
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>what is this whiskey that you find people have brought?</v>

26
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.023
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

27
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Each y d means and fun times.</v>

28
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It does good talks in depth conversation.</v>

29
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>They invented that shit when people thought dragons were real.</v>

30
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.463
<v Speaker 1>They were worried.</v>

31
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.211
<v Speaker 1>They were worried.</v>

32
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Dragons,</v>

33
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fly out of castles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure we're okay.</v>

37
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we said anything that fucked up.</v>

38
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>

39
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.040

44
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>If I go off and listen to me while I'm sober,</v>

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of tiling nice here.</v>

73
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>We've been sending rockets in the spaces that I teed 50s.</v>

74
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the best part by far.</v>

75
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>We ever tell you about our car.</v>

76
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.133
<v Speaker 1>The Escalade.</v>

77
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

78
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.413
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

79
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>We went into the manual.</v>

80
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>We've got a great deal on it.</v>

81
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want to buy a van.</v>

82
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.321
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

83
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>there's four of us we can.</v>

84
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a better move.</v>

85
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Fishers,</v>

86
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>the user manuals,</v>

87
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>how to use like all the fucking spaceship buttons,</v>

88
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>former owner registration falls out.</v>

89
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:35.341
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

90
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>who was it set up?</v>

91
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk.</v>

92
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Good Google worrying.</v>

93
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Now the government is spying on you.</v>

94
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Three Elon Musk's form a vehicle to keep tabs on you.</v>

95
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>This is all like some sort of a scam.</v>

96
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Like Ilan Musk,</v>

97
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>big fan of honey.</v>

98
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:52.861
<v Speaker 1>Honey band says,</v>

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:53.694
<v Speaker 1>listen guys,</v>

100
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I need you to take a Cadillac off my hands.</v>

101
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Make electric it electric Suv Ilan,</v>

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

103
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.031
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

105
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] had to go buy clones signal the same one as in the back of my Tesla.</v>

106
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>That goes zero to 60 in one second.</v>

107
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>He's controlling the vehicle levies cars.</v>

108
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>He's creating these cars that are literally like,</v>

109
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>what's the most time you need speed?</v>

110
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>The most time we need speed is like at a rate are running at a red light stop to</v>

111
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>go or merging onto a highway.</v>

112
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

113
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're trying to merge onto a highway,</v>

114
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time you like legitimately need horsepowers.</v>

115
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>She only time,</v>

116
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>well this guy is creating a car that's in that way as fast as anything that you</v>

117
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>could buy ever.</v>

118
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Ferrari ridiculously fast.</v>

119
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even faster than a Ferrari.</v>

120
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.243
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

121
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>Not Feeling it.</v>

122
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

123
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>If the apocalypse comes,</v>

124
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need gasoline shit.</v>

125
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna need to burn things.</v>

126
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Purpose to it though.</v>

127
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>The electricity.</v>

128
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

129
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

130
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.033
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

131
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>If they can figure out solar to the point where they make some dope paint that's</v>

132
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>also like solar collecting and is like a solar panel.</v>

133
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it solar panel?</v>

134
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to look like,</v>

135
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>like the inside of an air conditioning filter.</v>

137
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Why did I switch stupid?</v>

138
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>But I can't solar panels like dope.</v>

139
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Why can't the whole car be just solar panels?</v>

140
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>why don't you make some slick ass fucking solar panels,</v>

142
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Because on,</v>

144
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>at Santos on it.</v>

145
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>But I think if they did that,</v>

146
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.833
<v Speaker 1>older women,</v>

147
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>they're working on it.</v>

148
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>If they ever figure out a way to make a car that is an 100% solar in California,</v>

149
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.001
<v Speaker 1>like a Tesla,</v>

150
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>like a really high end,</v>

151
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>beautiful car that also you never need to plug in.</v>

152
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>The batteries are so efficient.</v>

153
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.311
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

154
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're that far away from that.</v>

155
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>when I say that far thing like a hundred years,</v>

157
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're that far away.</v>

158
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I think they already know they're just hiding it because the gas situation is</v>

159
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

160
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Joe Totally sucks.</v>

161
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>That covers now I don't so out of the loop.</v>

162
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough time.</v>

163
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

164
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>that's all I'm saying in the day.</v>

165
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're tenacious d fan,</v>

166
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.441
<v Speaker 1>don't get mad at me.</v>

167
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed a lot of their work.</v>

168
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not what's going on here.</v>

169
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just not enough time to know that you had to pick,</v>

170
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>pick your mom.</v>

171
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Too much fucking material out there and we're all making more of it.</v>

172
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That's like how we do it.</v>

174
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It makes them fucking more,</v>

175
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the craziest thing about music.</v>

176
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>If you really stop and think about it at the break we were talking about</v>

177
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven and we're talking about um,</v>

178
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>all the different notes and the,</v>

179
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>the different things that they created way back then that you can still recreate</v>

180
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

181
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>That's just being able to notate,</v>

182
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>we can play music that was invented before was recording technology or that was</v>

184
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the recording technology.</v>

185
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is how that sounds.</v>

186
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure out a way to write this and now you can interpret that and make the</v>

187
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:02.654
<v Speaker 1>same sound.</v>

188
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

189
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back to then how many people wrote music,</v>

190
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>like what was the number of published works and like Beethoven's finest year,</v>

191
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.903
<v Speaker 1>Mozart,</v>

192
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.910
<v Speaker 1>was it mostly like people aren't fully aware of what Mozart actually wrote as</v>

193
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>opposed to like his family members contributed and stuff.</v>

194
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.693
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

195
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>That was box.</v>

196
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.553
<v Speaker 1>There's some of that.</v>

197
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't,</v>

198
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>the point is there wasn't much,</v>

199
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much notated,</v>

200
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>at least cause he was an education to do that.</v>

201
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>You needed tons of money.</v>

202
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to get people with serious money to sponsor your life,</v>

203
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

204
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And there just weren't that many tousled like that Tony Hawk,</v>

205
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong thing where it's like there's a couple of famous dudes in that</v>

206
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.923
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

207
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.161
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>

208
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck?</v>

209
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

210
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven.</v>

211
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.253
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

212
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.983
<v Speaker 1>Mozart.</v>

213
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>The dude's.</v>

214
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.981
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>There's like a couple other dudes that are like in the periphery.</v>

216
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.101
<v Speaker 1>That's like a three.</v>

217
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I got room for three or four major.</v>

218
00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

219
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>they're so fucking good though.</v>

220
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about saying all these contributing factors to the environment</v>

221
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>is like being an,</v>

222
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I was like Malcolm Gladwell's outliers.</v>

223
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's all these things that have to happen.</v>

224
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure there were other people that had these magical ears.</v>

225
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't have the resources to build it like Beethoven or Bach or Mozart</v>

226
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:18.851
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

227
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

228
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>if you like the arts,</v>

230
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>like the Metta chief family who you know were benefactors to these people that</v>

231
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>like flourished because of their incredible amount of wealth.</v>

232
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

233
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just certain things.</v>

234
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>That was the chair.</v>

235
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fart.</v>

236
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Just making that clear.</v>

237
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like straight up.</v>

238
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about this.</v>

239
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Here we are.</v>

240
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>What happened to us?</v>

241
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>They were so smooth.</v>

242
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>We were so smooth on top of it.</v>

243
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>We're still smooth.</v>

244
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Our feelings are like right up front and you know they're right there.</v>

245
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for us to talk about why you guys were upset at each other a few</v>

246
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>days ago.</v>

247
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not.</v>

248
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.861
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not.</v>

249
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't even talk about that and I need for,</v>

250
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I think we went through two and a half hours of awesome psycho analysis.</v>

251
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Go back and listen to that shit afterwards.</v>

252
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:13.604
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be like,</v>

253
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:13.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

254
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you meant,</v>

255
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you said some really beautiful shit.</v>

256
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding for whether it's people want to listen to it or not.</v>

257
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>We all lies on the spot</v>

258
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.193
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

259
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.420
<v Speaker 1>We'll take the,</v>

260
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the front,</v>

261
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>the falsified information.</v>

262
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>You ever listen to classical music?</v>

263
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Speaking to Beethoven or anymore?</v>

264
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

265
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.033
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

266
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult side.</v>

267
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm going to listen to it.</v>

268
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Like when I write I'll put on headphones on an airplane.</v>

269
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

270
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to navigate.</v>

271
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much shit and it's like,</v>

272
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>historical at this point.</v>

274
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta like really energizing though.</v>

275
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's like,</v>

276
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>did it like that doesn't like make you fall asleep.</v>

277
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

278
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

279
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

280
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>let's get up.</v>

281
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's also conquer the day.</v>

282
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>The other problem with it is</v>

283
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 2>like as a person who makes stuff,</v>

284
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I always look at it as like just some crazy cover band because it's not really</v>

285
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.064
<v Speaker 2>Mozart.</v>

286
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.271
<v Speaker 2>Mozart's dead.</v>

287
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>It's fuck.</v>

288
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Like even if they're nailing it,</v>

290
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 2>even if they're there,</v>

291
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 2>they're nailing what he was asking for.</v>

292
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not him doing it.</v>

293
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Half of the Star spangled banner is not the noise [inaudible] wow.</v>

294
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

295
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

296
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.410
<v Speaker 2>It's knowing that Jimi Hendrix did that at Woodstock in 1969 that's half of what</v>

297
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:25.261
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

298
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:30.261
<v Speaker 2>It's like the sound that I hear from a Sturgill Simpson song or a honey honey</v>

299
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 2>song or fucking run DMC,</v>

300
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.231
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

301
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's their shit and it's coming out of them.</v>

302
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cover band.</v>

303
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:45.201
<v Speaker 2>It's their words with their annunciations boom.</v>

304
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

305
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.001
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

306
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:48.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

307
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want.</v>

308
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

309
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear like somebody recreating.</v>

310
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

311
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

312
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I understand it that,</v>

313
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's compelling and amazing and artistic and so integral to the structure</v>

314
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 2>of music,</v>

315
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 2>even today,</v>

316
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>interest not men.</v>

317
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting to hear.</v>

318
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.951
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

319
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Because I come from a total or just desire to always fucking here.</v>

320
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 2>That shouldn't be listening to music in a way to be like,</v>

321
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to describe it I guess,</v>

322
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>but in a way that's a different class of what you're talking about.</v>

323
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

324
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.303
<v Speaker 2>the idea of like,</v>

325
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear somebody express themselves.</v>

326
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm using,</v>

327
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking offers,</v>

328
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but I want to hear like when you're playing guitar,</v>

329
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.563
<v Speaker 2>I know those were,</v>

330
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 2>that's been scratching those wires.</v>

331
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 2>It's you doing that,</v>

332
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:40.711
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

333
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I hear you,</v>

334
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 2>like you come through that and there's nothing wrong with the,</v>

336
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the ability to transmit this information any other way.</v>

337
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Then write it down and notes,</v>

338
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 2>sell these books that,</v>

339
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

340
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

341
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

343
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:56.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

344
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 2>it gets a hundred years,</v>

345
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:58.411
<v Speaker 2>200 years,</v>

346
00:10:58.411 --> 00:10:59.244
<v Speaker 2>300 years.</v>

347
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way to do it.</v>

348
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have any other way,</v>

350
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 2>but we have a better way now.</v>

351
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

352
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:03.931
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

353
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:04.291
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

354
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

355
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.340
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

356
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain,</v>

357
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not an indulgence.</v>

358
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is,</v>

359
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking about it while you said that.</v>

360
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

361
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

362
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I just like listening to those sounds.</v>

363
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.841
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

364
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Whether the motets making,</v>

365
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I just liked that sound,</v>

366
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

367
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's cool.</v>

368
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 2>But it's also something that you do in your free time.</v>

369
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>You have time to sit down and say,</v>

370
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to appreciate some sounds as opposed to what you're talking about.</v>

371
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:23.641
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

372
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hear a person.</v>

373
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

374
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.101
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

375
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:26.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

376
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 2>in in that sense I'm wrong because it's really two completely different things.</v>

377
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of them's a beautiful orchestration of sounds and the other one is</v>

378
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 2>a person's like expression coming through.</v>

379
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Especially with the addition of language,</v>

380
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>the addition of songs and song writing and the words like,</v>

381
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.124
<v Speaker 2>it's really almost,</v>

382
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like the difference between,</v>

383
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like completely different artistic endeavors.</v>

384
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

385
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 3>it almost feels like those like Mozart sounds are like genetically passed down</v>

386
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.291
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

387
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Like they've been around for so long that like they become this like you feel</v>

388
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 3>them in your body when you hear it.</v>

389
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:06.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like you hear,</v>

390
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.410
<v Speaker 3>you feel this like physical reaction to them in this way.</v>

391
00:12:09.411 --> 00:12:10.170
<v Speaker 3>That and as,</v>

392
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.003
<v Speaker 3>as you do,</v>

393
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

394
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 3>song written vocal expressions.</v>

395
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.093
<v Speaker 3>But those are,</v>

396
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 3>they're so old that there's something really interesting that happens from this</v>

397
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 3>traditional reaction to it.</v>

398
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

399
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 3>No one I think would be the shit.</v>

400
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.421
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

401
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:26.254
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

402
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.550
<v Speaker 2>crash from the float lab and Venice develop some crazy underwater speaker system</v>

403
00:12:34.201 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that's waterproof.</v>

404
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

405
00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:36.750
<v Speaker 2>He's such a wizard.</v>

406
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

407
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking dude created that.</v>

408
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And he also has been working like forever on this idea of a screen that amidst</v>

409
00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.950
<v Speaker 2>the lowest amount of light possible,</v>

410
00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:51.870
<v Speaker 2>so that needs to be suspended from you in front of your face when you're a in</v>

411
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:52.560
<v Speaker 2>the tank.</v>

412
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.380
<v Speaker 2>And you could see these images almost like they're floating in the air.</v>

413
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't see a television.</v>

414
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You only see the images in this,</v>

415
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.400
<v Speaker 2>this sensory deprived situation you fic.</v>

416
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 2>But he's got the speakers that he has figured out how to submerge like in the</v>

417
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 2>water next to you.</v>

418
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

419
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Crazy,</v>

420
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.010
<v Speaker 2>and it gives you the stereo sound in the water where it vibrates off of your</v>

421
00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:14.700
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

422
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Like you feel it,</v>

423
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you feel it on your arms and your legs.</v>

424
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 2>You feel it.</v>

425
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.893
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

426
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

427
00:13:20.071 --> 00:13:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

428
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it all is,</v>

429
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:22.560
<v Speaker 2>which is such a crazy,</v>

430
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just one.</v>

431
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

432
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.240
<v Speaker 2>what's it?</v>

433
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

434
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.080
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

435
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.241
<v Speaker 2>Playing the sounds.</v>

437
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:27.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

438
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear them.</v>

439
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.643
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>

440
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done this.</v>

441
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>A new system he's got,</v>

442
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

443
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.071
<v Speaker 2>but he's a,</v>

444
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>he's always trying to innovate,</v>

445
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:36.751
<v Speaker 2>but in the,</v>

446
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:39.480
<v Speaker 2>in that way he said that you feel the music,</v>

447
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.280
<v Speaker 2>you feel it through the line,</v>

448
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.900
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>

449
00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I did that music.</v>

452
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>If it's done through one of those things,</v>

453
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 2>like this is just one step.</v>

454
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:49.620
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got a couple of speakers.</v>

455
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.920
<v Speaker 2>What if they insert them through the entire base of an isolation tank and then</v>

456
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.410
<v Speaker 2>program music like,</v>

457
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:58.861
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

458
00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:03.300
<v Speaker 2>they do those South American Eco rose with the shamans when they do the IOWASCA</v>

459
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:03.751
<v Speaker 2>ceremony.</v>

460
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Some therapy would,</v>

461
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 2>if they figured out a way to like get you into some fucking crazy trans,</v>

462
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about how houses have certain frequencies and then make you</v>

463
00:14:13.051 --> 00:14:13.884
<v Speaker 2>go nuts.</v>

464
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

465
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:15.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's like a certain one,</v>

466
00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:17.340
<v Speaker 2>some people do like some</v>

467
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Jimi Hendrix did that and he talks about it sometimes.</v>

468
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you get five minutes,</v>

469
00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 3>six minutes into some of this music he's making and people kind of fall into a</v>

470
00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:26.754
<v Speaker 3>different state.</v>

471
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.241
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

472
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:28.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a different place.</v>

473
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm saying,</v>

474
00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:32.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like people are looking for it and a lot of musicians,</v>

475
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:33.720
<v Speaker 3>that's what is based on,</v>

476
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:33.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

477
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:38.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like how can I make this shit shake to kind of cast a spell without,</v>

478
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's not the best way to put it,</v>

480
00:14:39.931 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I'm trying to affect you with rat and you can do it in</v>

481
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:45.030
<v Speaker 3>intentionally almost.</v>

482
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like you go to a different place.</v>

483
00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:47.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

484
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:47.280
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

485
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.570
<v Speaker 3>if you're like really trying to,</v>

486
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.130
<v Speaker 3>trying to do something like that,</v>

487
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:50.970
<v Speaker 3>it's like a weird,</v>

488
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>maybe I sound</v>

489
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>crazy things that we do it all the time.</v>

490
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't think about it that way,</v>

491
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but what you're doing is trying to connect with people and express yourself when</v>

492
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it like vibrationally fucking hippie tall</v>

493
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

494
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Bruh.</v>

495
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.571
<v Speaker 1>It's hippy talk.</v>

496
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:09.404
<v Speaker 1>I agree with.</v>

497
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with AP talk comes from the mouth of hippies occasionally.</v>

498
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.383
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

499
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.450

638
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of guys didn't believe that.</v>

639
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.310
<v Speaker 1>The guys who were calling us don't worry.</v>

640
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>A lot of leather</v>

641
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.771
<v Speaker 1>or suede.</v>

642
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I wore this kind of squared like that I should have wore off.</v>

643
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like on a stage coach in the 17 hundreds of tassels,</v>

644
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.341
<v Speaker 1>tassels.</v>

655
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Like people have these like connections to certain elements of like what you put</v>

682
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.553
<v Speaker 7>I had him on one of them.</v>

683
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 7>I did this show once</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's for ESP or not ESPN VH one.</v>

686
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.310
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the guests on the show.</v>

687
00:22:50.311 --> 00:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to hang out with that guy for like an hour.</v>

688
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.423
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

690
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.771
<v Speaker 1>But it was so weird.</v>

691
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:56.101
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

692
00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:56.701

694
00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm senior talking to rock and roll royalty.</v>

695
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.790
<v Speaker 1>You know when I was in high school,</v>

696
00:23:02.791 --> 00:23:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend that was obsessed with Judas priest.</v>

697
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll let them sit around</v>

698
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and wait until we had this fucking kid.</v>

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.360
<v Speaker 1>That that fucking song.</v>

706
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You got another thing coming fueled that dude through high school.</v>

707
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God it though.</v>

708
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing about what you guys do.</v>

709
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Like music can be heard it like it feels like you can eat,</v>

710
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like fuel.</v>

711
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Speaker 1>There's something to it.</v>

712
00:23:41.101 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it didn't,</v>

713
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Hunter Thompson had a,</v>

714
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.710
<v Speaker 1>he had uh,</v>

715
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 1>an amazing quote about that.</v>

716
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>He thinks of music as inspiration or is it fuel heath?</v>

717
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I think he said fuel and he said that when you listen to it,</v>

718
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>you swear that you can get 'em shittily paraphrasing what he said,</v>

719
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was like you could,</v>

720
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you could drive further on an empty tank of gas that you can just</v>

721
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:04.394
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

722
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll allow you to go at 20% longer or something like that.</v>

723
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I forget what his actual quote was,</v>

724
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that's true.</v>

725
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something happens man,</v>

726
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.180
<v Speaker 1>when a song you've got</v>

727
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 1>don like you feel stronger,</v>

728
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

729
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>If you were at the gym,</v>

730
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it sounds also like bringing you back to this place that you'll never like that</v>

731
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 1>always bring you back.</v>

732
00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:26.721
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

733
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll bring you back to like this childhood of like,</v>

734
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 1>nobody can fucking touch that.</v>

735
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Like this summer I,</v>

736
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>every time I listened to the fucking this song,</v>

737
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:35.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 1>it brings it back to this time where I'm like,</v>

739
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it almost makes you giddy.</v>

740
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Hunter s town.</v>

741
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's the code.</v>

742
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Music has always been a matter of energy to me.</v>

743
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 1>A question of fuels.</v>

744
00:24:42.901 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Sentimental people call it inspiration,</v>

745
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 1>but what it really means is fuel.</v>

746
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I have always needed fuel.</v>

747
00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a serious consumer on some nights.</v>

748
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 1>I still believe the car with the gas needle on empty can run about 50 more miles</v>

749
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 1>if you have the right music.</v>

750
00:24:57.111 --> 00:24:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Very loud on the radio purpose.</v>

751
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.561
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful border.</v>

752
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:01.394
<v Speaker 1>I butchered that.</v>

753
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.713
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read that</v>

754
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 1>paraphrase job.</v>

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.673
<v Speaker 1>ac DC.</v>

757
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.450
<v Speaker 1>For me it was a suicidal tendencies.</v>

758
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring me down cause the greatest weightlifting song at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I'm 10% stronger.</v>

760
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You can</v>

761
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>never heard of suicidal tendencies.</v>

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

767
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:28.550
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

768
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who listens to that you can lift more weights.</v>

769
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You become stronger,</v>

770
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.313
<v Speaker 1>you become stronger.</v>

771
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.701
<v Speaker 1>You can be angry.</v>

772
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:34.971
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

773
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:35.804
<v Speaker 1>sorry to interrupt,</v>

774
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>but that gave me a question in my mind.</v>

775
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>

776
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I just learned about estrogen blockers.</v>

777
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

778
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.323
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about</v>

779
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:47.863
<v Speaker 1>estrogen?</v>

780
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way that I have like with Roach motels there.</v>

781
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:52.394
<v Speaker 1>If you need them,</v>

782
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you should get them.</v>

783
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

784
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

785
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 1>just blew my mind the other way.</v>

786
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:00.134
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

787
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.621
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

788
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:00.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

789
00:26:00.941 --> 00:26:01.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

790
00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:01.941
<v Speaker 1>if you have a headache,</v>

791
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:02.774
<v Speaker 1>you should get aspirin.</v>

792
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

793
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

794
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:04.851
<v Speaker 1>What's going on,</v>

795
00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:05.684
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

796
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to somebody about building muscle and he was like,</v>

797
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

798
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.681
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

799
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:10.514
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

800
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with those things is what their,</v>

801
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:14.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

802
00:26:14.581 --> 00:26:18.560
<v Speaker 1>the with a really good for is if someone is coming off of a steroid,</v>

803
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>because when you take a steroid,</v>

804
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>your endocrine system suffers,</v>

805
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 1>stops producing testosterone and this,</v>

806
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:24.591
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

807
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 1>like they're called,</v>

808
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>like Clomid is one of m and a,</v>

809
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of other different companies that make a similar product and it</v>

810
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.960
<v Speaker 1>increases your body's ability to reap,</v>

811
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 1>to produce testosterone.</v>

812
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.700
<v Speaker 1>It has this like affection blocking the estrogen.</v>

813
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 1>You produce more testosterone,</v>

814
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:43.780
<v Speaker 1>your body tries to seek some sort of a balance.</v>

815
00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>He sort</v>

816
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>of trick it.</v>

817
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

818
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I think we know so little about what,</v>

819
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 2>what does and doesn't like work for you.</v>

820
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:53.701
<v Speaker 2>Like is it,</v>

821
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of experimentation going on like,</v>

822
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:56.011
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

823
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe he needs a this or maybe he needs out of that.</v>

824
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>How old is he?</v>

825
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 2>What's his background?</v>

826
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Speaker 2>But you can get this stuff over the counter.</v>

827
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

828
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.643
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

829
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.780
<v Speaker 2>what have you done before you decided to do that?</v>

830
00:27:05.781 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 2>This is the like if anybody ever wants to do something,</v>

831
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>if they ever want to go,</v>

832
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.541
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

833
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about getting into a hardcore workout program.</v>

834
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 2>How many days in a row have you worked out?</v>

835
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Be honest me.</v>

836
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:15.041
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

837
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:15.131
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

838
00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:15.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

839
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.350
<v Speaker 2>This is why I set those dude too.</v>

840
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

841
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:17.971
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

842
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you fuck you.</v>

843
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:19.441
<v Speaker 2>Fuck her.</v>

844
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

845
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.621
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>

846
00:27:20.621 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 2>if you want to start running marathons,</v>

847
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:22.960
<v Speaker 2>you've got to run every day.</v>

848
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.290
<v Speaker 2>But she,</v>

849
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:23.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

850
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't just keep talking to you.</v>

851
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:25.800
<v Speaker 2>You're talking nonsense.</v>

852
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

853
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.813
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

854
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:27.841
<v Speaker 2>And if you're saying,</v>

855
00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:27.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

856
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about taking estrogen blockers.</v>

857
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 2>How many days do you lift weights?</v>

858
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.243
<v Speaker 2>How often?</v>

859
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>How sore are you?</v>

860
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.320
<v Speaker 2>A little bit sore.</v>

861
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

862
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even do that.</v>

863
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Say never going to work the thing if you wanted,</v>

864
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to do it,</v>

865
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:43.890
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you do before you think about estrogen blockers are in a hurry.</v>

866
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just be consistent.</v>

867
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the most important thing.</v>

868
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 2>It's more important than anything.</v>

869
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 2>It's more important even than the amount of weight that you lift.</v>

870
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the frequency in which you engage in the act of going to the gym and</v>

871
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:56.964
<v Speaker 2>exerting yourself.</v>

872
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you can consistently do it every time,</v>

873
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 2>we talked to this earlier but I'd do it,</v>

874
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:04.801
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

875
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 2>this is plastic and available daily,</v>

876
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:09.010
<v Speaker 2>but you could just take this shit and from no,</v>

877
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.171
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

878
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:09.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

879
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 2>You need prescription.</v>

880
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 2>They do need a good ass unless it doesn't work.</v>

881
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean unless it's fake fake ones.</v>

882
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 2>The people may forgive my ignorance,</v>

883
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but is this anything that like transgender people would take to?</v>

884
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

885
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:23.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

886
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:23.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

887
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:23.941
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

888
00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a different,</v>

889
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it's really to try to stimulate growth of,</v>

890
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 2>to stimulate the reproduction of testosterone by like trying to fuck with the</v>

891
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:34.681
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

892
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Like by suppressing estrogen,</v>

893
00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you sort of try to elevate your body elevates us.</v>

894
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:39.201
<v Speaker 2>Todd.</v>

895
00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:44.201
<v Speaker 2>There's like some wrestling match going on cause they need hardcore chemicals.</v>

896
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

897
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 2>They need bio identical hormones that are in whatever gender they identify with.</v>

898
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I decided to transition into,</v>

899
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.673
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the,</v>

900
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean objectively nonjudgmentally but objectively it's one of the oddest things</v>

901
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.430
<v Speaker 2>about the whole idea.</v>

902
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

903
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that like this is who you are.</v>

904
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is who you are.</v>

905
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Also putting hormones in your body to become what it would,</v>

906
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you feel like you should be.</v>

907
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.440
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

908
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.440
<v Speaker 2>there's many layers and and totally nonjudgmental,</v>

909
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.730
<v Speaker 2>judgemental sense.</v>

910
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 2>No one's telling you to not do it at all,</v>

911
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

912
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot going on there.</v>

913
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not just identifying with something,</v>

914
00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>it's choosing to transitioned into,</v>

915
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot,</v>

916
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's some serious complexity to all of this and in a nonjudgmental</v>

917
00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:32.311
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

918
00:29:32.311 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very fascinating.</v>

919
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 2>It's very fascinating that we're coming more and more comfortable with it</v>

920
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.740
<v Speaker 2>because ultimately isn't it really when it's all over?</v>

921
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

922
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 2>what do I,</v>

923
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.543
<v Speaker 2>who gives a fuck?</v>

924
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Like jokes aside,</v>

925
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.801
<v Speaker 2>laughing,</v>

926
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 2>assigned a serious hot debates.</v>

927
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Who cares if you want to be a man,</v>

928
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a woman,</v>

929
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be both,</v>

930
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 2>you want to switch back and forth.</v>

931
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy on one of the NPR,</v>

932
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it was not in a radio lab.</v>

933
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

934
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I was switches back and forth.</v>

935
00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.441
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

936
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 2>sometimes he's a woman.</v>

937
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man now.</v>

938
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.940
<v Speaker 1>He just is because in his head,</v>

939
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the way he identifies,</v>

940
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.470
<v Speaker 1>he was like two different people in his head.</v>

941
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.760
<v Speaker 1>One of them's man and then it becomes a woman and in the middle of the things</v>

942
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.011
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

943
00:30:11.011 --> 00:30:11.581
<v Speaker 1>I just switched.</v>

944
00:30:11.581 --> 00:30:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I just flipped here like he's talking,</v>

945
00:30:13.051 --> 00:30:14.670
<v Speaker 1>he's people like I'm a man now and we were like,</v>

946
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

947
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You can just do that again?</v>

948
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.440
<v Speaker 1>This isn't it possible.</v>

949
00:30:19.441 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>

950
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't it possibly he's making shit up.</v>

951
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Do we have electrodes?</v>

952
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And like sometimes he's like,</v>

953
00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:26.220
<v Speaker 1>what is he thinking about dicks?</v>

954
00:30:26.221 --> 00:30:27.054
<v Speaker 1>It's all decks.</v>

955
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's vaginas.</v>

956
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.473
<v Speaker 1>Agendas now,</v>

957
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 1>well I mean there's an emotional mental screening process for people that want</v>

958
00:30:34.531 --> 00:30:39.531
<v Speaker 1>to go like full throttle with the like Dick to v d two D to d switch it up.</v>

959
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately like pretty certificated.</v>

960
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 2>It's surgery and I think there's gonna come a really interesting time where</v>

961
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 2>they're able to manipulate what you are in a way that's non,</v>

962
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 2>not like as primitive as cutting and stitching things back up together.</v>

963
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 2>But maybe like somehow or another altering what you actually are like changing.</v>

964
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Like the signal that your cells have and what shape you want it to form.</v>

965
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think that's outside of the the possibilities.</v>

966
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

967
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 2>what about transmitting consciousness to different body because people do talk</v>

968
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 2>about that while we're also recognizing that your body's not,</v>

969
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>it's what you need it while you're using it,</v>

970
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's not all of you and that the idea of who you are when you're not even</v>

971
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:32.050
<v Speaker 2>connected to your body like that might be the real you and what what this body</v>

972
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 2>thing is is it's like this,</v>

973
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you have this like biological thing that you're attached to if sort of evolved</v>

974
00:31:39.971 --> 00:31:44.971
<v Speaker 2>with you and in just the same way you have all this weird bacteria on your skin</v>

975
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.590
<v Speaker 2>and weird flora and your intestines.</v>

976
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 2>That might be exactly what like life and the body is and that the consciousness</v>

977
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:53.614
<v Speaker 2>in the body,</v>

978
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

979
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 2>they're the really the,</v>

980
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.660
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of the same thing but not really the same way.</v>

981
00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Like the things that are growing in your body.</v>

982
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:06.541
<v Speaker 2>All the millions and billions and trillions of microbes and life forms that live</v>

983
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:08.320
<v Speaker 2>in every one of us.</v>

984
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.491
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

985
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:09.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

986
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 2>and we don't want to think that they're all,</v>

987
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 2>they're not even important if without them you're fucked.</v>

988
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Just cause you can talk.</v>

989
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean they're not in on the whole thing.</v>

990
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

991
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 2>you're a giant collection of living,</v>

992
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:23.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.903
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

994
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.421
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

995
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:26.254
<v Speaker 1>we're crazy.</v>

996
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.820
<v Speaker 1>We're so odd.</v>

997
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.770
<v Speaker 1>It makes me think of the planet thing.</v>

998
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

999
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.870
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden all these gases,</v>

1000
00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:35.010
<v Speaker 1>all this shit's just boom,</v>

1001
00:32:35.011 --> 00:32:38.730
<v Speaker 1>smacks together and then it's the thing or it was a thing before.</v>

1002
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Now the form changes.</v>

1003
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 1>But like the fuck is it?</v>

1004
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Why is the center burning up?</v>

1005
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1006
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1007
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm too dumb for that.</v>

1008
00:32:47.081 --> 00:32:47.331
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

1009
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.161
<v Speaker 2>You don't like those zones?</v>

1010
00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:49.570
<v Speaker 2>She dumped four k like,</v>

1011
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 2>like water on Mars.</v>

1012
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1013
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.440
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

1014
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 2>what water?</v>

1015
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.911
<v Speaker 2>Ice.</v>

1016
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:53.301
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1017
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I can get those concepts.</v>

1018
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.423
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1019
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I've seen water melts.</v>

1020
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it get cold.</v>

1021
00:32:57.931 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen icicles on Mars.</v>

1022
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if they really did find a life form on Mars?</v>

1023
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Haven't they found bacterias and like microscopic things think they found</v>

1024
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 1>evidence of biology</v>

1025
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.810
<v Speaker 2>in my very rudimentary way of understanding what those guys are talking about.</v>

1026
00:33:18.811 --> 00:33:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I think they find like there's certain cities,</v>

1027
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.453
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

1028
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1029
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:27.850
<v Speaker 1>patterns that they can find that might indicate some sort of biological life at</v>

1030
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:28.791
<v Speaker 1>some point in time.</v>

1031
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think they found a smoking gun.</v>

1032
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they found like a fossil or am I right,</v>

1033
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1034
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.483
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

1035
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>And there's the potential that there's like forms of life that we cannot</v>

1036
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 1>identify as as humans.</v>

1037
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1038
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 1>like aren't like these,</v>

1039
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 1>physical elements.</v>

1041
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 1>But that it's like almost something that you just can't see,</v>

1042
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:46.191
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>

1043
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:46.791
<v Speaker 1>taste or touch,</v>

1044
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:47.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1045
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:47.834
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1046
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1047
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>

1048
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to be the craziest thing to say.</v>

1049
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be that everything's alive.</v>

1050
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 1>It might,</v>

1051
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it might be that everything that you encounter reacts in some sort of a weird</v>

1052
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:00.434
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1053
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 1>But we are so rigid in our idea of what's alive,</v>

1054
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.250
<v Speaker 1>what's not alive or what's conscious and not shot,</v>

1055
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 1>but retains energy.</v>

1056
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And what doesn't that we don't think about it.</v>

1057
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't think about like objects and how well the,</v>

1058
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:13.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1059
00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:13.400
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1060
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the psychics talk about like multidimensional planes and stuff and I dunno,</v>

1061
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:18.531
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1062
00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:18.891
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1063
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you stand on this stuff,</v>

1064
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're mostly bullshit,</v>

1065
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.853
<v Speaker 1>bullshit stuff.</v>

1066
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 1>But there's also stuff that I've seen that I'm,</v>

1067
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain and I'm like,</v>

1068
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

1069
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.003
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1070
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:32.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:33.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1072
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you mean.</v>

1073
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 1>You never know what to talk about it right now.</v>

1074
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's like we were talking about the ghost hunting shows earlier.</v>

1075
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't not believe in like that guy a,</v>

1076
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.230
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

1077
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Zack Baggins.</v>

1078
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1079
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a nice guy.</v>

1080
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the show for it.</v>

1081
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Entertaining.</v>

1082
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 1>He goes looking for ghosts.</v>

1083
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you some ghost stories?</v>

1084
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:51.411
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

1085
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:52.244
<v Speaker 1>here's the go story.</v>

1086
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1087
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:53.803
<v Speaker 1>So my dad,</v>

1088
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1089
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>running this restaurant with my uncle since he was 17.</v>

1090
00:34:58.191 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 1>He kills a man with ax.</v>

1091
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Not Lately,</v>

1092
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't pay for up.</v>

1093
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 2>You said sauce.</v>

1094
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1095
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 1>but my dad was telling me this story that,</v>

1096
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that long ago that this family that's been coming into the restaurant</v>

1099
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>for years and years and years,</v>

1100
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1101
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>came in and he saw everybody,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1104

<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1107
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 1>beautiful grandmother shining the back.</v>

1108
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1109

<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

1125
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:46.584

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.711
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>

00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:49.851
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1130
00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 3>he like looked away and she was gone and he sat the family down and,</v>

1131
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.773
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1132
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 3>he was really freaked out and he like,</v>

1133
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 3>he was kind of like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

1137
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 3>he came back and he said,</v>

1138
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:02.041
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1139

<v Speaker 3>how's your,</v>

1140
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.020
<v Speaker 3>how's your mom doing?</v>

1141
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:04.381
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

1142
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:04.531
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1143
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:04.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1144
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 3>she passed a couple months ago and he had this moment where he,</v>

1145
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:08.611
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1146
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I should tell them.</v>

1147
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 3>And he did and he said,</v>

1148
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.200
<v Speaker 3>I feel really uncomfortable,</v>

1149
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:13.391
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1150
00:36:13.391 --> 00:36:15.990
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like I need you to know that when you came into the restaurant,</v>

1151
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I saw your mother standing behind you guys.</v>

1152
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1153
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't kind of,</v>

1154
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.460
<v Speaker 3>they didn't freak out and they,</v>

1155
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>they just said,</v>

1156
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>we really feel like she's still with us.</v>

1157
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1158
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 3>and that's not the first time my dad's had a weird ghost story at the</v>

1159
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.210

1170
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.461
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years ago.</v>

1171
00:36:43.461 --> 00:36:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't that long ago.</v>

1172
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1173
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.020
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1174
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1176
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.843
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1177
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1178
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 1>if you can have people,</v>

1179
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1180
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.050
<v Speaker 1>if the idea that goes to ridiculous,</v>

1181
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:55.603
<v Speaker 1>why is it,</v>

1182
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.530
<v Speaker 1>why is it any more ridiculous than an echo?</v>

1183
00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 1>You ever get under a bridge and yell,</v>

1185
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.773
<v Speaker 8>hello?</v>

1186
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.183
<v Speaker 8>Hello?</v>

1187
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.673
<v Speaker 8>Hello?</v>

1188
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.660
<v Speaker 8>Hello?</v>

1189
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.550
<v Speaker 8>Hello.</v>

1190
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Why is that weirder than ghosts?</v>

1191
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

1192
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a ghost.</v>

1193
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Could be just as likely could be like your,</v>

1194
00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:14.521
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1195
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 1>your actual life form whenever it was,</v>

1196
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:17.161
<v Speaker 1>when you went.</v>

1197
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:17.994
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1198
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might like Echo,</v>

1199
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 3>we underestimate how powerful our energy is.</v>

1200
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:22.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1201
00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:25.720
<v Speaker 3>people can leave a real impression that people can stay with you.</v>

1202
00:37:25.721 --> 00:37:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Like literally like have you ever had somebody who just like fucking kicked your</v>

1203
00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:32.440
<v Speaker 3>ass energetically and you left a place and you're like,</v>

1204
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:32.921
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1205
00:37:32.921 --> 00:37:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like there's still with me,</v>

1206
00:37:34.571 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1207
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.630
<v Speaker 3>like that stuff is not to be taken lightly.</v>

1208
00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1209
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.760
<v Speaker 3>And it can be the absolute opposite end of the spectrum of joy and love and</v>

1210
00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:45.580
<v Speaker 3>kindness and you can get energy in these places.</v>

1211
00:37:45.581 --> 00:37:50.581
<v Speaker 3>And I think some people can have an innate ability to us to interpret it in a</v>

1212
00:37:50.921 --> 00:37:54.640
<v Speaker 3>different way where they are maybe actually see it or the hear it or whatever.</v>

1213
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:55.271
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1214
00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:56.290
<v Speaker 3>cause I believe my Dad,</v>

1215
00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:57.011
<v Speaker 3>I love my dad.</v>

1216
00:37:57.011 --> 00:37:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I believe him.</v>

1217
00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1218
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>it's totally possible that someone can actually see an aura.</v>

1219
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 1>But if you can't take a photo of it,</v>

1220
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just have,</v>

1221
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I just have to bank on the fact you know,</v>

1222
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>out of your fucking mind,</v>

1223
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you know to date we've talked to my dad and he'll ask him,</v>

1224
00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1225
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And go screen screen all around him is green.</v>

1226
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Green is like,</v>

1227
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I see him,</v>

1228
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.381
<v Speaker 1>I see him,</v>

1229
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:20.214
<v Speaker 1>I see his arm.</v>

1230
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:21.790

<v Speaker 1>He was on a show called freaks and Geeks,</v>

1563
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:45.964
<v Speaker 1>They were moving fast,</v>

1564
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 1>but in the book and the books and the audio tapes,</v>

1565
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which we listened to on toward,</v>

1566
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 1>they were slow.</v>

1567
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.350
<v Speaker 1>When I saw the movie scared the fuck out of me.</v>

1568
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I will head kick the fuck out of a Zombie.</v>

1569
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now,</v>

1570
00:49:57.221 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about style zombies.</v>

1571
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I warm up with some software to the body moving and then once I feel like this</v>

1572
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:05.311
<v Speaker 1>dummy,</v>

1573
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:07.110
<v Speaker 1>he's going to just walk right into a wheel kick.</v>

1574
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna try to take a Zombie's head off,</v>

1575
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 1>tried to kick a Zombie.</v>

1576
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:10.923
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1577
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I wonder sometimes when people like Halloween time when people like to fuck with</v>

1578
00:50:15.581 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 1>each other and someone who's like,</v>

1579
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to dress up like a Zombie and scare people,</v>

1580
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but if they like take it to an extreme,</v>

1581
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 1>like if someone would actually like go crazy on them because the fear of zombies</v>

1582
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:26.134
<v Speaker 1>is so great.</v>

1583
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:26.350

1587
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 1>That's really dumb.</v>

1588
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I was in Montana right around the time.</v>

1599
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like this crazy camouflage suit were dudes were in the military to hide</v>

<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

1601
00:50:58.431 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes people use it for extreme hunting situations.</v>

1602
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1604
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 1>This guy did it in pretending to be big foot.</v>

1605
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So he put this Ghillie suit on and stood by a Bush.</v>

1606
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And then when people were on the highway,</v>

00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 1>stepped out into the highway and no,</v>

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 1>She sent bigfoot flying.</v>

1611
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And then here's where it gets even crazier.</v>

1612
00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Another teenage driver going the opposite direction.</v>

1613
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Dan ran over him again,</v>

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

1736
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:36.780
<v Speaker 1>My [inaudible] teacher is an asshole.</v>

1737
00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking,</v>

1738
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear Duran Duran anymore.</v>

1739
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.800
<v Speaker 1>These there a problem.</v>

1740
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1741
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:46.973
<v Speaker 1>Lucky people,</v>

1742
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.060
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of local people here.</v>

1743
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I think people when they were alive are lucky.</v>

1744
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the amount of people that have died and the fact that you're</v>

1745
00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>not one of them,</v>

1746
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you should be really fucking happy.</v>

1747
00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.470
<v Speaker 1>It was lucky it shit.</v>

1748
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1749
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.340
<v Speaker 1>we're all lucky.</v>

1750
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a perspective,</v>

1751
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 1>that perspective issue and the disenchantment with your own,</v>

1752
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.590
<v Speaker 1>your own position in the perspective.</v>

1753
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That's like what fueled the whole thing.</v>

1754
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's unavoidable in some way.</v>

1755
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 1>If I say like one more time I'll smack myself.</v>

1756
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.773
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1757
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.530
<v Speaker 1>like man,</v>

1758
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:25.280
<v Speaker 1>like I hear myself saying,</v>

1759
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1760
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.190
<v Speaker 1>shut up bitch,</v>

1761

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 1>you could fall into those things.</v>

1765
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:35.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1766
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1767
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 1>We're all lucky as fuck.</v>

1768
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:38.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1769
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>

1770
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1771
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that trend will continue.</v>

1772
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean we really nice if the people next after we're done look back at us,</v>

1773
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 1>like the way we look at those coven wagon Douche bags,</v>

1774
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1775
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 1>we look at those covered wagon Douche bags like,</v>

1776
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.891
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1777
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:54.560
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have medicine he had bark to do.</v>

1778
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.120
<v Speaker 1>If somebody broke their leg,</v>

1779
00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:00.640
<v Speaker 1>broke my hand him with a rock and you might've went back to eat them.</v>

1780
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Keep pulling.</v>

1781
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1782
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of eating people back in those days.</v>

1783
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.303
<v Speaker 1>That's when we should like,</v>

1784
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get to judge civilization.</v>

1785
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Like how much cannibalism per capita,</v>

1786
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the Donner pass.</v>

1787
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about that and I was like,</v>

1788
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.833
<v Speaker 1>Danner,</v>

1789
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.291
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams,</v>

1790
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:26.330
<v Speaker 1>he's like dinner 30 of that party of four.</v>

1791
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know where they were going.</v>

1792
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have topographic map.</v>

1793
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Crazy could've have just kept getting worse.</v>

1794
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Why would this so cocky?</v>

1795
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know America was there,</v>

1796
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:40.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1797
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 1>They were in the wrong spot.</v>

1798
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:42.400
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1799
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the people that landed in the West indies,</v>

1800
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 1>that's where they landed,</v>

1801
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:46.984
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1802
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they were so confident and not even knowing that the North America</v>

1803
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:51.970
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>

1804
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 1>they were in totally wrong spot and then they move across North America.</v>

1805
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 1>They get to these mountains,</v>

1806
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they get to these insane rocky mountains,</v>

1807
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.660
<v Speaker 1>these immense peaks like what's the highest,</v>

1808
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 1>what is it like 11,015 years this up there,</v>

1809
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:06.191
<v Speaker 1>and they just go,</v>

1810
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:06.401
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1811
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 1>let's go there.</v>

1812
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>

1813
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:08.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1814
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:09.403
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure it out.</v>

1815
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Animals to people ratio at that point.</v>

1816
00:58:13.281 --> 00:58:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not even cold up there,</v>

1817
00:58:14.141 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1818
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.513
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

1819
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.261
<v Speaker 1>Stop bringing up pause.</v>

1820
00:58:16.261 --> 00:58:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Puzzler like what does it do?</v>

1821
00:58:17.931 --> 00:58:19.660
<v Speaker 1>They know for sure what was on the other end?</v>

1822
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:20.301
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the store?</v>

1823
00:58:20.301 --> 00:58:20.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1824
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's whole Lewis and Clark.</v>

1825
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Then they were looking for a passage.</v>

1826
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1827
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:24.850
<v Speaker 1>this could be here.</v>

1828
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:25.780
<v Speaker 1>We hope this is here.</v>

1829
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.160
<v Speaker 1>But the Donner party is that,</v>

1830
00:58:27.161 --> 00:58:27.994
<v Speaker 1>what was that story?</v>

1831
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Because the Donner party had people already gone through.</v>

1832
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.530
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of families and I think,</v>

1833
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like,</v>

1834
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 50 people went through and like 20 people made it out pull.</v>

1835
00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 1>That didn't make it were for a fuel for the rest of the journey.</v>

1836
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1837
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Please quote me on incorrectly.</v>

1838
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Correct you right?</v>

1839
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:53.783
<v Speaker 1>But she says,</v>

1841
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 1>how bad must it have been where they were that they wanted to take that chance?</v>

1842
00:58:59.110 --> 00:58:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1843
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'd just be like,</v>

1844
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 1>time next buyer.</v>

1845
00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you see gold?</v>

1846
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Was it a gold rush thing?</v>

1847
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1848
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was people really desperately looking for their,</v>

1849
00:59:09.871 --> 00:59:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1850
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.170
<v Speaker 1>like this is our place.</v>

1851
00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 1>We need to find our place.</v>

1852
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Come on though.</v>

1853
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.830
<v Speaker 1>We'll do whatever we needed to do.</v>

1854
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Because you imagined the one person that was like just not that fucking Gung Ho</v>

1855
00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:21.124
<v Speaker 1>for this trip.</v>

1856
00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:22.030
<v Speaker 1>You're hanging</v>

1857
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 7>back and like to young gun rather they're tying down the wagon.</v>

1858
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1859
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.213
<v Speaker 7>Give me a hand</v>

1860
00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:32.151
<v Speaker 7>in the legs.</v>

1861
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 7>I think it's,</v>

1862
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 7>you start with the meat parts.</v>

1863
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 7>You know the hide.</v>

1864
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:35.720
<v Speaker 7>I'd be like,</v>

1865
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:35.861
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1866
00:59:35.861 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 7>it's hind legs.</v>

1867
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.130
<v Speaker 7>Smeta was where all the animals aren't shifts.</v>

1868
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.030
<v Speaker 7>Let's go back to the light.</v>

1869
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:44.301
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1870
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:46.850
<v Speaker 7>it would suck that I just had a deal.</v>

1871
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 7>What should I put me first deal.</v>

1872
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:51.463
<v Speaker 7>It's my idea.</v>

1873
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.200
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to tell us to go over the mountain,</v>

1874
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.290
<v Speaker 7>so if it all goes back,</v>

1875
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 7>I'll let you bash my head in with a rock and you can eat me.</v>

1876
00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.301
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
