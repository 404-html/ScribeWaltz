1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.500
You're welcome.
Good.
Hey,
freak pitchers.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.580
That's how you started off with podcasts.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.420
this is a lot of people out there doing it wrong.
Um,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.510
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:16.950
Squarespace.
Uh,

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.340
we've had Squarespace as a sponsor of our podcast for several months now.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.020
And um,

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.160
we've been really happy with the feedback that we've gotten from you people

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.810
who've actually tried it and used it.

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.240
It's one of the easiest ways you could ever make a website.

11
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.241
A dummy like myself could put this shit together if you have never heard of it.

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.990
The way Squarespace is set up is it's the old days.

13
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.991
You used to have to either learn html or you'd have to learn a program that

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.420
allows you to create your own website.
Very complicated.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
But Squarespace makes it ridiculously easy and they have it set up so you could

16
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.920
try it out without entering your credit card information.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
That's how confident they are of their product.
If you go there,
just try it out.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.370
Build yourself a little snazzy website and you go,
you know what?

19
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.650
This is pretty bad ass.
I'm going to,
I'm going to go with this.

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.360
Then you use your credit card information and if you use the code Joe,

21
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:13.980
and then the number eight,
all one word,
Joe Eight,
if you do that,

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.430
they will give you 10% off your first purchase on new accounts,

23
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.820
including monthly and annual plans.
So go check it out.

24
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.270
It's a pretty sweet sight.
Um,
it's so easy to do that.

25
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.840
Brian has made probably like 10 websites while we've been doing this pop up

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.950
podcast.
We will over the course of like,
Squarespace is a sponsor.

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.520
How many websites have you done?
Yeah,
a lot.
I mean,
it's so fast.
It's like,

28
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.730
not even like,
I don't even like,

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.720
that's like just doing whatever and like throwing trash away.

30
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.230
And the thing is they look good.
They look like a website.

31
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:45.690
You would pay someone to do,
they look as good as my website.

32
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.350
I paid somebody to do my website,
my next website I'm going to fucking do myself.

33
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.830
That's how gangster I am a squarespace.com.

34
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.530
The code again is Joe and the number eight.

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.970
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com uh,
if you,
uh,
have been,
uh,

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:03.730
waiting for the gorilla kettle bells,
they're out now.
It's it,

37
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.490
it's official and they look fucking awesome.
It's 72 pounds.

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.730
And this was a difficult thing to design because not only did we have to make

39
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:19.020
sure that it looked cool and it looks awesome.
The,
uh,
the artwork is fantastic.

40
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.770
I will have to get the artist's name from Aubrey and credit them because they

41
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.060
did an amazing job on both the chimp and the gorilla.
And look,
it's just,

42
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.300
it makes kettlebells extra fun.
That's what it does to me.

43
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
I view the chimp is if it was attempting to bite my penis off,

44
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.160
that's how I see the chimp,

45
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.180
the chimp phase and the gorilla is about to steal your soul.

46
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.050
That's what it looks like to me.
72 pounds.
And um,

47
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.810
if you've never worked out with kettlebells before,

48
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.811
it's the best way you can get your full body to work as one strong unit with

49
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.740
weightlifting,
if that makes any sense.
For functional strength for,

50
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.740
for whether it translates into athletics or just being able to actually pick

51
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.030
things up and move things around.
Having a strong body.
Kettlebells are amazing.

52
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.310
Um,
we have a video on,
uh,

53
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.390
on at.com called the extreme kettlebell cardio workout by Keith Webber.

54
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.400
Um,

55
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.580
it's an amazing workout and if you can do that with the 72 pound gorilla kettle

56
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:18.970
bell,
you're a fucking beast.
I can't,

57
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.540
I almost throw up when I use a 35 powder.
It's a brutal workout.

58
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.000
So we saw all of that kind of shit it on it.
Um,

59
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.010
strength efficient conditioning equipment,

60
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.190
including battle ropes and weight vests and Macy's.

61
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.690
And contrary to popular belief,
this is an armor and a,
these aren't weapons.
Okay.

62
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.820
I know it looks like we're trying to formulate an army,

63
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.440
selling them brain pills and cordyceps mushroom supplements and getting them to

64
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.210
think about chimpanzees.
Biting your Dick off,

65
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.870
but no one's trying to plan any ideas,
folks.
Okay.
These are just,

66
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.060
this is just to work out,
get yourself an ab wheel,

67
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.620
do some yoga by some Himalayan sea salt and go fuck yourself.
Okay.

68
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.850
Use the code name,

69
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.080
Rogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

70
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.273
Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.660
Dan Carlin's here for round dose and when we're fixing to make shit happen,

72
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.873
<v 1>boom</v>

73
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.600
<v 0>experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

74
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.870
Powerful Dan Carlin.
We had,

75
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.280
we couldn't start this podcast quick enough because we were podcasting before.

76
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.020
The POCs are talking before it happens.

77
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.840
It's going to be back in the house of Brogan.
That's good.
It'd be happy back sir.

78
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.950
Appreciate it very much.
But yeah,
we,
we,
we literally had to say stop,
stop,
stop,

79
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.550
stop,
stop.

80
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.350
There's so much that we were talking about from Anthony Wiener to how much of it

81
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:43.270
needs to be in the podcast.
Yeah,
that's a good point.
The folly of man,

82
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.350
you know,
it's Oh Anthony wiener to the folly of man.
Well it is the folly of man.

83
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.150
He is.
Anthony Wiener is the folly of man.

84
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.610
Who was the reason why we all recognize with him as we all know,

85
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.920
that could've been us.
Okay.

86
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.740
If you were that guy live in that life thinking that way for that long,

87
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:01.060
doing the and making the decisions he made,
he,
that guy got on the path.
It

88
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.510
<v 2>doesn't focus on the drives me crazy.
Can I just,
sure.</v>

89
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.820
The reporters as an old reporter,

90
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:09.210
the reporter should ask the question this way.

91
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.320
Forget about the specific salacious thing that we're having so much fun with,

92
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:18.321
which is all they focus on and ask this here is a guy that knows what's out

93
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:22.080
there.
Right?
Decides I'm going to run again,

94
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:26.340
knowing that what's out there is out there and that what's out there will be

95
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:31.210
discovered again and that he will be in the position he's in now.
Right?
Yeah.

96
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.820
Okay,
so the guy who does it any way,
I'm now going,

97
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:39.060
this is the guy who's working on nuclear nonproliferation.
This is the guy who,

98
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.060
I mean this is a judgement question where you go,

99
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.150
if a guy knows I'm going to put myself into position 100% absolutely where I'm

100
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.780
going to get whacked again.
I mean I just,
I suffered through all that.

101
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.840
I went to marriage counseling.
I'm going to get to do it all again.

102
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.770
100% chance of that and I'm going to run anyway.

103
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.710
<v 3>I don't care about the issue he got zapped with.</v>

104
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.780
I'm cared about all the other issues that that same judgment is being applied
to.

105
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.540
Yeah.
He's obviously crazy except that he's not the only one.

106
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.150
What I thought about with Clinton where you go,
okay,

107
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.680
I don't mind the Lewinsky thing.
I mind that a guy smart as that man is,

108
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.450
has to know it's going to come out and it has to still go through with it and I,

109
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.930
that's the part I can't fat.
Well,

110
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.720
I think the type of person that wants to be mayor in the first place,

111
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.910
the type of person,
okay,
I'm with you on that.

112
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.620
There's this insane belief in yourself.
Something weird already.

113
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.210
What's the old line if you want to be a politician or you should be disqualified

114
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.230
for that desire.
Yeah,
that's,
I've echoed that sentiment without even knowing.

115
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.250
It was a quote I always said,

116
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.990
no one should be president that wants to be pressed.

117
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.840
I had somebody tell me the same thing about police officers and he was a police

118
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.030
officer.
Say if you decided,
you know what I want to do,

119
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.730
I'm going to go tackle people and I want to point the gun at people and I want

120
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.120
to,
if you want to get cats out of trees,
you should be a police officer.

121
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.090
You know these other things,
the adrenaline pumping things sound good to you.

122
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.120
I want you to take a lot of big battery of tests first and make sure

123
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:01.910
everything's cool.
That's such an important point,
man.
I mean,

124
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:04.610
isn't that what we wound up with that Christopher dormer guy,

125
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.900
the crazy guy that got fired as a cop and went on a rampage just started killing

126
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:12.080
cops and ally?
Well,
I had,
I had a buddy who,
who,

127
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.420
and he was a wild man.

128
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.450
I mean he was just not the kind of guy you wanted to even turn your back on when

129
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.560
you went out at night with each.
And he went into the police academies,

130
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.300
graduated second in his class or whatever and then left and said,

131
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:26.440
those people are crazy.
And they just see this course.
But you know,

132
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.810
I know a lot of police officers,
they're wonderful guys.
My point is is that it's,

133
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.580
it's an interesting line of work.

134
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:34.700
Have you ever seen the different police videos that they show around the country

135
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.290
and in some of these towns,
you know,

136
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.600
the way that they sell being a police officer,

137
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:40.040
it looks like Andy Griffith and you're like,

138
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:43.370
that's exactly the kind of guy I want to apply for the job.
And another ones,

139
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.190
they're showing you in the armored vehicles pulling up with the arm and you're

140
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:49.910
going,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Someone that likes that ad and the response to that ad,

141
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.430
it should be instantly disqualified from wanting to be one.
Well,
you know,
it's,

142
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.930
you're,
you are a professional conflict person.
That's right.

143
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.680
That that becomes the real issue because most of us try very hard to avoid

144
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:04.400
conflict because the stress of conflict is really unhealthy.
Yes.
And dangerous.

145
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.550
Dangerous.
It's freaky.
Make bad choices.
You know,

146
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:12.290
people don't realize like how stressful life or death situations can be and

147
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.670
someone who does that professionally is constantly in life or death situations.

148
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.970
That's a professional conflict person.
It's an incredibly difficult job.

149
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.400
Crazy people all the time.
I mean,
let's realize how tough that job is.

150
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.250
But if you're sitting at home going,
what am I going to do for a job?

151
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.850
And you see a guy in armor and he's rolling on the ground and that looks good to

152
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.680
you.
Join the army,
you know,
there's other places for you.
Yeah.
It's um,

153
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.710
it's almost like applying or a attaching to a mindset.

154
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.780
You know,
the idea of,
uh,

155
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.030
getting someone who would be willing to do the job in like a very enlightened

156
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:54.521
way is almost impossible to find because even if they were like this,

157
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:56.190
you know,
Depok shopper type

158
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.420
<v 0>cat who with a gun that was just trying to calm everyone with the yoga between</v>

159
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:04.800
outings and they've be,
we are experiencing this objective.
Sergeant Gandhi.

160
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.820
I think after a while your own self preservation instincts would kick in if you

161
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:10.140
were in a suitably bad neighborhood.

162
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.990
<v 2>Gallows humor and everything.
I mean,
we were,</v>

163
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.510
we reporters used to be able to joke with the cops,
well,

164
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.280
because you're out at two in the morning.

165
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.890
It's a murder scene and there's some twisted,
weird,
I mean,

166
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:22.230
I remember going to a murder scene that was really horrible,

167
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.970
but there were a few twisted aspects that are kind of funny in a Quentin

168
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.050
Tarantino dark way and they know they can joke with you about it even though

169
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:35.370
it's a tragedy and they're upset about it.
Right.
It's almost a coping mechanism.

170
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:36.390
You know,
the old line is,

171
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.960
and there's no question that most police officers are just fine and we never

172
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:43.600
hear about the Sergeant Gandhi on Youtube or you know what I mean?
So,

173
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.760
but they're very careful about who enters their ranks for a reason.

174
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.480
So why would you put out a video showing all the adrenaline pumping things,

175
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:51.901
you know,

176
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:55.080
when you're trying to recruit these people who aren't going to go crazy when you

177
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.150
have a police shooting situation.
You know,

178
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.570
<v 0>recruiting in and of itself is very strange.</v>

179
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.890
It's very strange that you're allowed to make this romantic depiction,

180
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.240
essentially manipulating someone's ideas of what it would be like to be a police

181
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:09.660
officer.

182
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.840
And that's what you're doing dealing with homeless people on the street with

183
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:13.621
with,
yeah,
exactly.

184
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.220
Because that's most of your job or an army commercial where your truck runs over

185
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.570
an IED and you know it gets launched in the air.
Most of your friends do.

186
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.210
We don't even show that on the recruiting videos.
Well,
that's,

187
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:26.070
it's very strange that it's come to that.

188
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:29.160
It's very strange that we're in this weird situation where we've somehow or

189
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:33.000
another agreed that it's okay to withhold and not share information.

190
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.940
Especially information about really pertinent news,

191
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.640
like the war is a very important subject,

192
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:43.290
but all you ever get is you occasionally get a few numbers with letters behind

193
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:46.530
them and that's what represents the dead.
You get that in the news,

194
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:49.590
you get that on the newspapers.
It's very rare.

195
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.730
There's stories on CNN or anything about the toll,
who's dying,

196
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.230
who their families are,
how they're coping with,
what are their thoughts on it.

197
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.350
<v 2>You have to know though that that is all by design.
That's not excellent,</v>

198
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.580
but here's the,
here's the,

199
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.640
I had this conversation with somebody just the other day where I said,
look,

200
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.520
the stuff is out there.
I mean this is the Internet age.

201
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.630
There are a camera phones.

202
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.440
If you want to go see what the war is really like go online and start searching.

203
00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:15.890
And you will see the problem is,
is if you are the one looking for it,

204
00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:18.800
you are not the one who has to see it.
Well,
right.
The old,

205
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:20.300
the old three network thing was,
you know,

206
00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:24.200
you're eating dinner and the Vietnam War intrudes in your living room with death

207
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:26.360
and violence and Gore and all of a sudden you're like,
wow,

208
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.680
look at what war really looks like.

209
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.010
The guys who are looking at war to see what it really looks like.

210
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:34.970
One might be liking it and two,
they,
they're not the ones you have to educate.

211
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:37.030
It's,
it's Middle America and you know,

212
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.310
Mr and Mrs. Jones who need to see it and don't want to look at it.
Yeah.

213
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.560
<v 0>And want to be fed a Sandra Bullock movie and we want to be speeding other</v>

214
00:11:44.561 --> 00:11:48.430
things.
You know,
life is happening,
man.
Life is happening.
That's right.

215
00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:52.930
And who has time?
Yeah.
It's,
it's just,
uh,
it's,
it's a weird admission.

216
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.070
You know,
that that's

217
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.660
<v 3>where we're at when the,
you know,
the world we live,</v>

218
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.830
we want to look at it one way,

219
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:03.070
but it's like really clearly not the way we want to look at it.

220
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.880
And when you see these sort of romantic depiction,

221
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:09.190
it's like you're seeing the one for the marines,
those videos where they,
they're,

222
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:12.960
they're showing you like a recruitment video and the guy's got a sword spoil.

223
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.090
Yeah.

224
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.500
And they're doing in mixed martial arts from each other and each chair flying

225
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.950
over this obstacle course,
like a bad ass.
Yeah.
And you're like,

226
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:23.620
what does any of that have to do with war?
You didn't shoot anybody there.

227
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.840
No one piloted a drone in that commercial.

228
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:29.620
You pulled out a sword and you guys really,
here's the scary thing,
man,

229
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.070
to take it to the police video we had imagined showing and marine recruitment

230
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:36.390
video where you're showing pump in 20 bullets into a body that's exploding it

231
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.890
buddy.
And the guy goes,
yeah,
that's what I've been waiting to do this.

232
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.650
I mean you have the same problem.
I mean,
you know,

233
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.680
not sure you want those guys joined the [inaudible].

234
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.440
Well they're going to probably join anyway,
but you're absolutely right.
Yeah.

235
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:50.680
What's the solution there?
Because he want really good killers.

236
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.240
If you want really good killers,

237
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:53.950
you know you've got to make sure they're trained correctly.

238
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.070
Getting instead of the man,
I don't think we have to do any better.

239
00:12:57.071 --> 00:13:00.790
They're really good.
Let's not,
let's not minimize.
No doubt.

240
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.430
Well I'm saying if you're trying to recruit them though,

241
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.430
what is the way you would go about doing it?
They go to e three man,

242
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.700
they have their own video game and the army has one really cool first person

243
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.440
shooter and they go there with these.
Yeah,

244
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:15.760
they do and they did that on purpose tents and like the kids are like,
wow,

245
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:18.100
this is a cool video game.
Is this what it's really like?

246
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.810
You know what they used to do though?
Back in my day.

247
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:22.810
I remembered them at the high school that's about three miles from here,

248
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:26.050
which is where I went to high school.
Then landing the brand new,

249
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:29.080
never before seen a patchy helicopter when it was brand new,

250
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.160
right on our high school football field and the whole school gets to go out

251
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:37.240
there and I remember watching the guy in the Apache showing us how the guns were

252
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.640
attached to his helmet and if he turned his head to the left,

253
00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:43.900
the guns in front of the Apache Wood and oh look how cool this is.

254
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:47.230
I moved my head to the left of these two machine guns.
Go to the,
to the look,

255
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:49.330
I can win and met your teacher.
You know,
I mean it was just,

256
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.370
it was that the 1982 version,
way better than that.
Atari 7,200 you know,

257
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:56.950
think about that.
Yeah,
it is pretty crazy.
If you think,

258
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.850
think about the idea that they're recruiting by using video games and that

259
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.870
eventually those are skills that are going to translate throughout the look.

260
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.460
Let's make no mistake about it.

261
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.790
Whoever's the first to get a robot army of bulletproof tightener on the way

262
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.910
there right now,
man,
we got,
yeah,
I mean for real.

263
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.360
We're real close to being able to do that.
We already have flying ones.

264
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.050
They're walking ones.
Have you seen these walking robots that are developing?

265
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.280
Wait until this shit.

266
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:28.780
Wait til it's our Marone's taking wait til it's our drones taken out their

267
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:29.500
drones.

268
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.440
I mean once you get to that point where the first thing you do is establish

269
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:35.560
drone supremacists before you,
you know,
send the troops on the ground.

270
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:38.410
We have a war in the sky with robots,
North Korea,
North Korea,

271
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.140
Korea already has human robots in some ways,
you know,

272
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:42.910
they would pretty much do anything a robot,

273
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:47.470
but they feel and they mainly are video game trained youth will save the
country.

274
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.740
North Korea is like the last country left that rocking like all full on military

275
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:58.400
dictatorship with nuclear weapons right in front of the world.
Yeah.

276
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:00.530
But you know what's funny is that they're like an egg.

277
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.340
They're putting this thing,
they appear to be strong on the outside,

278
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.800
but North Korea would go down as quickly as Iraqi.

279
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.140
They have no money and plus they just don't,

280
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.450
I mean it's high tech versus low tech.
A lot of,
you know,

281
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.020
I look at sometimes the North Korea and the publish how many tanks they have and

282
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:19.340
I mean,
but you look at the details of it and the tanks alone,
1950s vintage,

283
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:22.250
I mean they,
they move one foot and they'd be gone.
I mean,

284
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:25.430
that's what people don't understand that the patches would shoot them over the

285
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.530
skyline.
They wouldn't even see anything.

286
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.220
The night vision would destroy everything.
I mean,
it would be like third world.

287
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.550
I mean,
it's nothing you have,
they have these fucking ships now,

288
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.120
these battleships,
they launched these fighter jets off of and they're,

289
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.470
they're like cities.

290
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.700
It's a God damn city that's made a metal that floats outside of your town and

291
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.590
when you fuck up,
it's just there's,

292
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.730
they can see everything those night vision things when they see,

293
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.180
see what the side,
it's not,

294
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.700
the North Korea thing is a little weird because they're within artillery range

295
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:59.960
of a very large city soul,
which changes everything because you know,
they say,

296
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:03.440
okay,
yes you can beat us in one second,
but how many people in Seoul,
how much,

297
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:05.660
how many buildings can be knocked down before you destroy us?

298
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.800
But I think they have all those sites targeted from years of observation and you

299
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:10.190
know,
I'd be,

300
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.490
can you imagine if that had happened to the United States during the civil war?

301
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.840
If we became a north and South America like that or north and south United

302
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.130
States around there where we had like literally people that look just like us,

303
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:25.460
we're from our lineage.
The North would be like Canada now.

304
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.050
The south would be like the south,
it'd be this,
you know,

305
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.710
you wouldn't have slavery anymore.
I don't think.
I mean,
I think,

306
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:32.960
I think you would have eased out of that and you would,

307
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.890
you would have to similar countries that may be played in a football super bowl.

308
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.200
I mean,
you'd have the,
the union versus the confederate team.
You know,

309
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.030
it'd be interesting,
I'd love,
I've always loved to have this idea.

310
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.790
Do you remember back to the future of the movies?
I always loved to this idea.

311
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.930
I'd love to be able to program in an alternative reality and just see what

312
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:53.660
happened.
If you,
Hitler wins the Second World War,

313
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:55.220
the north and south and he just,

314
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.060
and you watch the different development go off into the distance and how many

315
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:02.450
things change,
right?
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
uh,

316
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.420
it's fascinating when you think of what could have,
I mean,
people,

317
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.050
the common phrase,
you know,
hey,
we would all be speaking German.
You know,

318
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.130
what would have happened if they discovered the nuclear bomb before it was what

319
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:17.630
could have happened and if to Japan dropped it on us before we could drop it on

320
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:22.250
them.
It's a,
those,
those moments in history are very strange,

321
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:26.000
aren't they have these pivotal moments where everything changes?
Well we,

322
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.010
and you know,
we talk about that.
Let me,
for us,

323
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.760
and I don't think we quite formulated how different this is,

324
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.090
but nine 11 is that kind of a,

325
00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:37.850
we lived through a moment that 200 years from now they will study as a pivotal

326
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:40.100
moment in world history.

327
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:44.590
One of these things where it took less than 24 hours to happen and,
and the,

328
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.680
and somebody wrote me a letter saying,

329
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:49.560
I don't buy your theory that the world changed with nine 11 really all that
much.

330
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.830
<v 2>I got to disagree with that.
I think we've never been the same.</v>

331
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:55.680
I think we may have had some trends that were leading to where we are now,

332
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.050
but they're the kind of things that wouldn't have happened without that.

333
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.360
It's almost like,
you know,
yeah,
we're on a precipice or something,

334
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.170
but somebody has to shove and nine 11 is like a Pearl Harbor.

335
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.000
When the explosion of the battleship Maine,
it's or,
or,
or the,
the,
you know,

336
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.110
the first world war starts with maybe the most significant terrorist attack and

337
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:13.944
human history.

338
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.570
One guy shoots a guy and his wife and the whole world explodes.
Well,

339
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.500
the world was poised to explode and he lit the powder keg.

340
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.040
But does the powder keg ever get lit if he doesn't do that?
So I mean,

341
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:26.760
that's what we're talking.

342
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.210
We were in an era where maybe there was a terrorist powder keg and a bunch of

343
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.840
things ready to happen,
but unless you have two buildings fall down,

344
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:36.720
or some guy said,
Dan,
more than two buildings fell down in New York.

345
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:37.690
Don't you know that if you,

346
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.560
unless you have a number of buildings fall down in New York on nine 11.

347
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.620
Does it ever have that push that sends you over the edge?

348
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:49.050
<v 0>Yeah.
The,
uh,
the idea of a historical moment.</v>

349
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.030
It's always been fascinating to me because when they happen you're like,
Whoa,

350
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.760
is this really happening?
Is this,
is that weird feeling?
[inaudible] 11.

351
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.110
And feel surreal when you watched lately surreal.
Every,
well,

352
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.280
I remember very clearly on nine 11,
I was hanging out with Joey Diaz,

353
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.320
Ralphie May,
Mike favor men and uh,
we were,
we were all like,

354
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.820
we were hanging out first.

355
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.560
Me and Joey were having a burrito whereas outside of Baja fresh on sunset and

356
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:20.490
we're looking up at the sky and we're like,
dude,
there's no planes.

357
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.790
Like there haven't been any plans.
Did you really?
Yeah,

358
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.010
there was no plans to notice that I,
that would never hit me.

359
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:27.270
I would never notice that.
Well,

360
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.330
I think I'd heard about it that they were going to cancel flights and then I

361
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:34.350
realized it once we were out there because it just sort of sunk in the whole

362
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:39.090
moment was from the moment the planes hit the towers to watching the replays on

363
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:43.360
TV.
It was,
it was almost like a bubble had popped,
like a door had opened,

364
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.730
like a new chapter.
It started.

365
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.670
<v 2>That's what we're talking about here.
Exactly.
Yeah.
You know what's rare?</v>

366
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:49.050
And we said this in the latest podcast,

367
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:50.460
so sorry to anybody who is already heard this,

368
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:54.660
but these events happen all the time,
but most of the time you don't realize it.

369
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:55.710
It's subtle.
It's,
you know,

370
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.680
we're living a day to day existence and historians 500 years from now,
we'll go.

371
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.990
They didn't even realize what an important moment of change,

372
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.780
but there are those moments that happen sometimes where the people who are

373
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:08.670
living through them,
there's so momentous that you can tell that you just go,
wow.

374
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:09.870
And yet we were like,
I mean,

375
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:12.600
I remember the whole day I'm getting like 200 phone calls from people going,

376
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.930
<v 0>oh,
what does this mean?
I mean,
everybody knew something was going on.
Yeah,</v>

377
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.620
yeah.
Um,
those weird moments,

378
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.680
those weird breakthrough moments or things change completely.
The,
we,

379
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:30.150
we,
we,
we loved them and we're terrified of them.
But you know,
I mean,
they're,

380
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:32.560
they're really exciting sometimes,
but,
uh,

381
00:20:32.561 --> 00:20:35.320
we're also absolutely terrified of a big event happening.

382
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:38.560
And that's one of the things they use to justify spying on people.

383
00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:39.880
Like all this NSA thing,

384
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.560
like Bill Maher saw bill Maher justifying NSA spying.
It was really fascinating.

385
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.140
And his,
he doesn't,
it's not that he has a bad point either.

386
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.670
His point was there's something that we have now that didn't exist when they

387
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:55.270
were writing the constitution and its nuclear weapons.
That's a good point.

388
00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.340
I mean if you really did find out that there was a possibility of a nuclear

389
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:05.341
attack on a certain area of the world and you could stop it because of these

390
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.990
strategies,
these,
these technological strategy.

391
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.400
<v 2>But here's where I would go with that because I want,
this has always happened.</v>

392
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.820
We just finished a show on the Spanish American war era and Teddy Roosevelt is

393
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:23.071
trying to tell people in the u s congress who keep bringing up the constitution

394
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:25.870
that that might have been fine in the age of sale,

395
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.680
but we live in the age of steam now and all of a sudden Europe isn't that far

396
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:32.690
away and these oceans aren't protecting us as much as they used to.
You know,

397
00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.500
it's,
we've been dealing with that pretty much since men at one.

398
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.550
So I mean I think you can make that argument.
And we're in the age of drones now.

399
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.384
We didn't have any,

400
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.200
either they're timeless and their human rights and you're born with them.

401
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.770
Or as soon as things get dangerous enough they're gone.
I mean,

402
00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:50.560
I think we have to sit down and have the conversation because I don't think the

403
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:53.200
guy,
and this is funny because you know,
you talk about the founding fathers,

404
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:56.490
like they're gods and then we realized that they have slaves and that they were

405
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.470
vulnerable levels.
And so fuck those slaves.
It's just,

406
00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:02.140
it's one of those things where you can't,

407
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.690
you can't romanticize it too much.

408
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:09.310
But at the same time they were talking about these things as human rights,

409
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:13.240
not you get them now and we'll see what happens when they developed steam power.

410
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:16.630
You right.
So we have to decide what our commitment is to them.

411
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.230
If it's a real commitment than it doesn't matter what the next weapon system is

412
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.730
because it's more important to have the human rights than it is to be protected

413
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:27.100
from nuclear weapons.
If you want to be protected from nuclear weapons,

414
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.520
you might have to jettison some human rights.
Right.

415
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.050
But at least frame it that way.

416
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.490
<v 0>Yeah.
It's,
it's a fascinating thing that every point in human history,</v>

417
00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:37.920
every single point,
if you could stop on that number,

418
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.970
that will have been the most advanced humans had ever been up until then.

419
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:42.751
You know,

420
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:47.751
and that's hard for us to wrap our heads around that the same sort of scenarios

421
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.310
keep playing themselves out over and over and over again.

422
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.520
And even though we're pretty convinced that,
you know,

423
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:58.290
we learned something from the,
the Greek and the,
the,
the Russian history and the,

424
00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:59.490
uh,
the history of Rome,

425
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.880
we've learned something from all the lessons of how things went wrong.

426
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.880
What was good about thing was what was good about the government,

427
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:08.610
what was good about the philosophies that they had created and the ideas that

428
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:12.840
they shared.
But it's basically the same thing as it's going on now.

429
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.870
<v 2>I'll tell you what,
we bring up a lot.
I hope I haven't overdone it and the shows,</v>

430
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:20.871
but I'm fascinated by this idea that we're never going to go backwards.

431
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.280
Yes.
You know,
when you talk about,
you know,

432
00:23:23.281 --> 00:23:25.320
this modern world and you look around and you think,
okay,

433
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:29.370
basically since the renaissance,
it's been all,
if this is the stock market,

434
00:23:29.371 --> 00:23:32.790
we've been going up ever since the renaissance and the idea that everybody has

435
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:35.310
is that,
and we're never going to go backwards.

436
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.670
We're never going to go look at a thousand years from now and see people who

437
00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:42.750
don't know about DNA sequencing anymore.
It's planet of the Apes,
right?

438
00:23:42.751 --> 00:23:46.310
Where you've gone backwards and Oh,
the of liberty's partly

439
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.820
<v 3>buried in the sand.
And I mean we,
we,
but every other culture,</v>

440
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.020
but every other country in the [inaudible] civilization and history of the world

441
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.510
has thought that.
I mean,
you didn't think the Romans were thinking,
God,

442
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.020
it's great.
Now pity it can't last year.
But we learned from them.
We know,

443
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.730
maybe we,
and not just that,

444
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:04.910
maybe the whole globalization and the fact that everybody's connected,

445
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.690
we'll change that dynamic.
But I think if you're gonna,

446
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.080
if you're trying to learn from history,

447
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:13.220
one thing history shows is these stock market upticks in the civilization stock

448
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:15.410
market don't last.
So what does that mean?
Well,

449
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:18.410
we like to think we're more special than all the other animals first and

450
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:22.700
foremost.
So we would like to think that,
you know,
even me,
I'm guilty this guilty,

451
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.050
absolutely as charged.

452
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.010
We'd like to think that we are eventually going to cheese,

453
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.390
achieve the highest levels of understanding and that that's the trend that

454
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.910
things are going and eventually going to work everything out.

455
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.510
And we won't have war someday in the future.
And that somehow or another,

456
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.040
we are basically human beings are basically good.
And,
uh,

457
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:45.110
we're gonna work this out in the universe is going to reward that.

458
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.430
But I got one word,
one word that refutes that.
Dinosaurs.

459
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.260
Okay.
The whole world was fucking run by Conti,

460
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.820
heartless lizards,

461
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
cold blooded monsters without a fucking Spec of emotion that never wrote a

462
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:05.720
fucking thing down.
Didn't give a shit about culture,
would eat their babies,

463
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.850
would eat anything that stood still.

464
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.600
That's what dominated this earth for the longest time.

465
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.460
And if it wasn't for an asteroid impact,

466
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.740
very likely would still be a version of that animal still running shit.

467
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.750
I'll tell you what blew my mind.

468
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:25.610
I read this book by a guy named Nick Bostrom who's a physicist and whose,

469
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.640
whose expertise is the science of catastrophe,

470
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.430
right?
He studies catastrophic events and he's written whole books with,

471
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:39.740
with a lot of other physicists who do this about the various ways we could end.

472
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.310
And one of the ways involve something called the Fermi paradox,

473
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:45.050
but you may have heard about,
which is,
you know,

474
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.680
they do these mathematical studies and they figured out how many planets in the

475
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:51.710
universe should be like ours and should be able to support life.

476
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.650
And then they do the calculation down,
down,

477
00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:57.740
down and try to figure out how many thousands or tens of thousands or millions

478
00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:01.490
of planets should have human life or something intelligent.
And then they say,

479
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.310
so where are they?
So the Fermi paradox is the,

480
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.040
if the numbers add up the way they do,
where are they?

481
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:12.041
And guys like Bostrom if figured out that every intelligent civilization reaches

482
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:18.221
a point where it could very easily destroy itself or collapsed like a house of

483
00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:19.310
cards or what.

484
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.570
And it's like this dangerous membrane and maybe he says it's after you'd involve

485
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:24.410
nuclear weapons.

486
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:29.600
And so the question is is most civilizations do not make it through this danger

487
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:33.800
zone from the time they develop nuclear weapons to the time they become like a

488
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.820
Gandhi civilization or whatever and most dies somewhere in that area that we're

489
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:40.250
now in right now.

490
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.950
And so the idea is that maybe this is where

491
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.210
<v 2>we go back to dinosaurs.</v>

492
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.860
<v 0>Well,
it's an interesting paradox that the survival of the fittest mentality,</v>

493
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:50.540
this,
this,

494
00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.540
this inner desire to conquer and survive and stay alive is also the exact same

495
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:58.740
thing that leads to innovation,

496
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:02.160
which is the exact same thing that leads to the highest levels of consciousness

497
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.850
and in technological innovation when they figured out how to bypass the human

498
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:07.680
body,
but yet they're still trapped.

499
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.920
And these trends of behavior that are based on just teeth and claws survival.

500
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.030
You know,
they're those,
those,

501
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:18.230
those instincts that drove us to get to the point where we're,

502
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.710
this evolved being,

503
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.420
you talk about a giant bunch of them in your podcast and some of them just as

504
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:28.520
recently as six,
700 years ago or reason than that.
Yeah.

505
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:34.110
The craziest thing ever is listening to,
you know,
you talk about,

506
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.640
um,
history that was only a few hundred years ago,

507
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:43.060
<v 2>only a few,
you think 12,
13,
14,
15 generations.
That's,
that's nothing.</v>

508
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.870
And they were living like insane people.
Well,

509
00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:51.010
and the truth is the way that they were living was a lot more like they were

510
00:27:51.011 --> 00:27:54.850
living in the time of ancient Egypt than we're living like any of them now.

511
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.990
And they're really living an unreal lifestyle in terms of what's normal for

512
00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:01.600
human beings.
Whereas through most of human history,

513
00:28:01.601 --> 00:28:05.860
they lived something much closer to the reality that the entire history of the

514
00:28:05.861 --> 00:28:07.090
species understood.

515
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.460
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
I,
I completely agree.
And you know,</v>

516
00:28:09.461 --> 00:28:13.030
we're talking about big great historical events.
The one,

517
00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:16.630
the one that doesn't really get as much credit as I think it deserves is the

518
00:28:16.631 --> 00:28:20.560
internet.
Oh yeah.
The Internet.
It didn't,
it didn't happen that quick.

519
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:25.590
It happened like a s it's a slowly hidden fines and got deepened.

520
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.503
Dora,

521
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.930
<v 2>what do you think if you had to put a year or a year or two or three,</v>

522
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.140
when do you think it hit critical mass and just,
yeah,

523
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:34.780
<v 0>broke.</v>

524
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.550
It seemed to me to be the early two thousands the internet became really

525
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:42.610
popular,
live without,
and everybody had to Wynnona writers.

526
00:28:42.611 --> 00:28:46.350
The only person not on the Internet now.
Yeah,
it was,
it seemed like,

527
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:50.410
and that was the years where it started to escalate as far as like the

528
00:28:50.411 --> 00:28:52.180
interesting articles that you could get,

529
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.260
the bandwidth situation had kinda gotten a lot better with people.

530
00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.110
Every commercial had a web address at the bottom of it.

531
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.320
You could get a really quick Internet connection pretty much everywhere in the

532
00:29:04.361 --> 00:29:06.460
early two thousands by the time that rolled around.

533
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.890
That made the experience so much more interesting.

534
00:29:08.891 --> 00:29:10.400
I think maybe I'm not dating it,
that

535
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.950
<v 2>I remember when the first web browser that people that average idiots could use</v>

536
00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:18.160
when the Netscape browser came on,
it was all of a sudden like,
oh,

537
00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:21.730
I don't have to be a computer whiz to figure out how to click on this thing and

538
00:29:21.731 --> 00:29:26.500
click on this thing and see something,
a read some news.
And I remember ladies,

539
00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:26.771
gentlemen,

540
00:29:26.771 --> 00:29:29.650
we're going to be able to talk about those of us as old as Joe Rogan and yours

541
00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:33.100
truly going to be able to tell our children about the wild west of the Internet.

542
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.990
When you would just click around and look,

543
00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:37.750
because there was some seriously weird stuff out there and you didn't,

544
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.980
there used to be the button is,
it's still there was says take a chance or,
but

545
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.170
<v 0>now it does not take a chance and you're at best buy.</v>

546
00:29:44.171 --> 00:29:46.810
But then it was like taking a chance and it was,
oh my God,

547
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:51.250
what did I just land on?
Some serious could say no internet.

548
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.870
I remember when there was no internet.

549
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:56.140
That's like our walking up the hill both ways.
My children,

550
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:57.850
my children look at me and I talk about,
you know,

551
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:02.740
pre smart phones and they just rolled their eyes.
Oh Dad,
how old are you kids?

552
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.590
11 and eight.
What a fascinating life.

553
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:08.890
It's going to be for a child growing up in their life that they don't even have

554
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:10.950
it.
They sit there and just look down at things all the time.

555
00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:14.080
Even when my brother was talking to me today about ads and he runs a business

556
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.750
and I said,
do you ever take out advertising?
He goes,
why?
Nobody ever looks up.

557
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.150
He goes,
you can get a billboard.
Nobody's going to see it.

558
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:20.440
They walk around looking down on it.

559
00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:22.470
They're going to have neck problems when they get older.
Well,

560
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.190
they are having neck problems in Korea.
Was there a high incident of neck bulges,

561
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:31.000
bulging discs,
and then when people evolve in in a hundred years,

562
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:34.450
we're going to have like this curvature where we're like a microphone or one of

563
00:30:34.451 --> 00:30:36.700
those heat lamps.
Bentos I don't think so.

564
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:40.720
I think the days of holding things in your hand are few and it's going to be the

565
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:45.130
glasses and it's going to be those and something new and I something in your

566
00:30:45.131 --> 00:30:47.620
eyes.
Wiener thought he had trouble before.

567
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:51.160
Wait till the Google glass or if we need thought he was having fun before.

568
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.900
You know the actual videos now it's only in trouble when he's getting caught.

569
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.530
It seems like he's having a really grand time when no one's bothering him.

570
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.521
You know,
I say,
look,

571
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:03.280
the Guy Sends Dick Pics is obviously people that want to receive him.

572
00:31:03.281 --> 00:31:06.580
He's played a little game.
Everyone's dancing.
Who Cares?
Well again,

573
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.250
you know he can't be mayor,
but I was just going to say white,

574
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.990
go into private prayer.
Charge money.
Having a web podcast,
you can,

575
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.120
but the type of person that wants to run days pick of the day brought to you by

576
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:19.831
wieners wound.

577
00:31:19.831 --> 00:31:24.580
Your attempt to who would sponsor the sponsorship ideas become quite

578
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:26.020
interesting.
We had a podcast,

579
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:30.070
I think it would be quite popping [inaudible] superstore or you take all of his

580
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:32.890
freak instincts aside.
The guy's very charismatic.

581
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.700
If you ever heard [inaudible] huge,
like six foot five.
What are you doing?

582
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:40.120
This is the wiener chick.
Oh,
I don't want to see her.
Don't give her any tension.

583
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.840
The whole thing.
I thought I heard.
He's like six foot five.
He's like,
he's huge,

584
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:48.630
dude.
Somebody told me he's in an enormous human being.
I can't confirm that.

585
00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.790
Maybe that's why he's got that giant hog.
Well,
that's why you just can't wait to,

586
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.210
somebody said to me,
would you be tweeting it out if it,
you know,
I mean,
no,

587
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.821
you wouldn't be,

588
00:31:57.821 --> 00:32:01.180
but if your name was wiener and you had a giant hog and you were crazy,

589
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:04.870
you might,
yeah.
There's nothing wrong with it.
This is what I say.
I say,
yeah,

590
00:32:04.871 --> 00:32:07.420
the guy's a fucking mess and I wouldn't want to be married to him,

591
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.360
and he know he can't be mayor.
But the fact that in the middle of

592
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.570
Yugoslavia thinking what u s cities would,
you know,
they'd be working it.

593
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.410
There's places where that was the fact that we're concentrating on that.

594
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:20.950
In the middle of this NSA thing,

595
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:23.790
in the middle of this Michael Hastings conspiracy theorists that say it.

596
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.010
That's why we're getting fed.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

597
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.310
Imagine we find out this chick's a CIA agent.

598
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.800
She was hired to lure Anthony Wiener because he's too cares what?

599
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.370
Remember the British government got brought down in the,
in a scandal with,

600
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.970
with KGB chicks.
Yeah.
So I mean it's happened.
Yeah,
it has happened.

601
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:44.600
Those Russian checks.
I'll get ya.
And this,
this,
what's really fascinating.

602
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:48.230
It was before this guy got busted.
He was a really charismatic guy.

603
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.620
He's a really good speaker and he was really dynamic and he made a lot of good

604
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:56.330
points.
And it's kind of fascinating that those like really charismatic guys,

605
00:32:56.331 --> 00:33:00.170
they're also the ones who really love pussy.
Well,
you know,
but,
but listen,

606
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:05.180
I mean we want things to exist in like this really unrealistic way.

607
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.460
Those JFK,
dude,

608
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.330
<v 2>those guys aren't wanting to be president.
They all were like crazy.</v>

609
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:13.340
We're partners.
He had some girlfriends,
you know,

610
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.470
Gandhi had a gang of bitches just waiting for him at the House with incense or a

611
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.000
double load.
Let's ask the more interesting question.

612
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.530
If you are concerned as we often point out in our political podcast about the

613
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:26.620
low level of leadership,
I mean if you,

614
00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:31.621
if countries rise or fall based on the sustained level of leadership and good,

615
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.260
well led countries do better.

616
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:36.050
I mean if companies well led do better than poor led companies,

617
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:36.890
what about countries?

618
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.420
And if the really good leaders come with these known flaws and we know that

619
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:44.180
there,
if you really want a good leader is going to come with all these personal

620
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:44.691
foibles.

621
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:48.950
And would you rather have the guy who's gifted at government with all his fault

622
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.130
or the mediocre guy,
but you know,
he doesn't ever do it.

623
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.360
There's no drugs in his background.
There's no sex,
no,
he's never done it.

624
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.800
He's been an accountant and clapped her racers,
but he's,

625
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.060
he's mediocre at leadership.
What do you take?

626
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.561
<v 0>Well,</v>

627
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:05.540
I'm certainly not delusional and I know that I forgot who I was and had all of

628
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:09.500
his phone.
I appears of a loaded question,
wasn't it?
No.

629
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:12.080
Clinton appears to me,
you know,
by,

630
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.910
by all accounts to be a very intelligent man.
And a very good leader,

631
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:20.870
but if you listen to some of the people that would talk about the atrocities

632
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:24.680
that were committed during his regimes,
the key is that he was involved.

633
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:26.780
There was a military actions that were very questionable.

634
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.160
They all have some pain,

635
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.840
<v 2>man.
These,
this whole Democrat,
Republican Clintons,</v>

636
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.000
none of these people are liberal.
None of these people.
I mean it's the,
it's a,

637
00:34:34.001 --> 00:34:37.500
it's,
it's what it,
Noam Cha,
not Noam Chomsky.
What did that Gore Vidal said.

638
00:34:37.501 --> 00:34:40.650
We have one party in this country with two wings and the wings are called

639
00:34:40.651 --> 00:34:42.360
Democrats and repo.
It's,
I can't,

640
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.450
<v 0>well,
he's had a great joke about it.
Which one wants it?
I remember he goes,</v>

641
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.260
he goes,
this is politics in this country.
Goes,
I liked the puppet on her left.

642
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.960
Yes.
Well,
the pulpit on the right seems to me

643
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.190
<v 2>George Carlin and some good ones too.
And you just go,
look,</v>

644
00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.360
if we could get over that,
we might actually make some progress.

645
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.210
But if you go the most depressing thing for me in the entire world.

646
00:35:03.211 --> 00:35:05.730
But I also think it's one of the coolest things that happened on the Internet

647
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.210
are those comments sections underneath all the news stories where people can

648
00:35:09.211 --> 00:35:12.000
sort of,
in one sense,

649
00:35:12.001 --> 00:35:14.820
I think that's the greatest thing ever invented because the media hates that.

650
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.310
I mean to have it shorter,
but on the other hand,
when you read it,

651
00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:20.880
it's like I could pretend that racism is almost a thing of the past and you go

652
00:35:20.881 --> 00:35:23.610
on some of these sites and you read what some of these people,
right,
and you go,

653
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.300
oh my God,
I hope this isn't representative.
And then you read the,

654
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.470
the left and the right,

655
00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:33.471
just eviscerating and I'll cut the throat of a liberal or Conservative need to

656
00:35:34.171 --> 00:35:38.070
be exiled off the planet.
You're like,
oh,
we are totally,
this is really

657
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.450
<v 0>representative of what's out there.
You know what I saw?
You want to,</v>

658
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.470
you want to stop gun control or do you want,
you want to stop the gun issue,

659
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.430
kill everyone with a gun.
Seriously,
it did not us.
Actually.

660
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.810
Somebody actually wrote that.
They're not.

661
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.100
Please tell me there's 1% of the people who posted an inordinate amount,

662
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:57.990
all these new stories and that that's what that is.

663
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:02.880
As opposed to just new stories on everything to express yourself freely.

664
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:06.240
Like every anonymous habit.
Yes.
Except in the NSA,

665
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.100
what you're always going to have a giant percentage of the people that are like

666
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:13.830
really unbalanced spending a lot of time doing that.

667
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.610
Like one of the things I would really enjoy doing and whether it has anything to

668
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:21.900
do with me or not,
but when anytime I read someone criticizing someone,

669
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.220
I like to go and see like what other posts they make.
Like where,

670
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:27.480
where else do they make posts?

671
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.110
And it's almost always like you read someone's Twitter when they say something

672
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:36.111
mean he'd go to it and it's just all mean shit to random people all day.

673
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.140
They're just spewing out to celebrities to,
to,
uh,

674
00:36:41.141 --> 00:36:43.980
you know,
entertainers to athletes,

675
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:48.630
to politicians to whatever.
They joke to.
Random cam girls,

676
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:51.930
random girls who have like websites.
I'm telling you,
man,
the,

677
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:55.550
I see some of these people,
it's just like you'd go to their website,
it's,

678
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.980
it's like you're watching madness.
You're watching,
well wait a minute.

679
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.470
That's their expression of who they are.
Think about that.

680
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:05.640
I mean there's mad crazy people out there who didn't have an internet to play

681
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:08.730
with 30 years ago and who do now.
Absolutely.

682
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:11.780
And also Manson and the old and the 60s would've had,
you know,
the,

683
00:37:11.781 --> 00:37:13.130
the Internet to play with them.

684
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.130
Imagine how the recruitment would have gone for Manson with the Internet.
Yeah.

685
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.490
Well he probably would have been exposed quicker too.
You know,

686
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.180
they would have been like,
he's a hope.
So first of all,

687
00:37:22.181 --> 00:37:25.470
he would have released all his songs on iTunes and he would have been a big star

688
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:27.840
and it never would have gone this way and he wouldn't have tried to kill that

689
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:30.180
beach boy,
Doris Day daughter Guy,
you know,

690
00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.860
Terry Melcher and it never would have happened.

691
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.090
Maybe or it would have happened bigger.
Right?
Yeah.
The,

692
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.470
I think the,

693
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.430
the Internet is certainly probably encouraged a lot of people to be assholes,

694
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.560
exposed a lot of people for being assholes.

695
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:48.561
But what concerns me is that we have no precedent in this ability to communicate

696
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:50.490
with people without a physical reaction from them,

697
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:52.710
without being in front of them.
Like one of the reasons,

698
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:54.750
like we recognize humanity in each other.

699
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:57.660
If you say something mean to someone and you see them react to it,
you feel bad.

700
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.770
You know,
like there's like a,

701
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:03.771
there's like a give and take an energy like exchange between two people when

702
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.160
they're communicating with each other.

703
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:10.430
But the fact that someone with no previous interaction with you could just snipe

704
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:15.090
at you,
your song fucking sucks.
I hope you die in a fire.

705
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.110
Your whole band should get aids like you,
you read these things.

706
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.310
It's like no one's ever been able to do that before.

707
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.400
You've never been able to in a fee.

708
00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.420
Like I can write you an email and in the exact same way they can contact you.

709
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:29.880
You're looking at something that they wrote on a screen.

710
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.850
So it can be someone who,
you know who,

711
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:34.920
who's a friend or it can be some fucking crazy,

712
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.590
but it gets to you the exact same way it gets to you as words.

713
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.690
<v 2>And that's better about this than I am because I am really,</v>

714
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.400
and this is like asking for,
it isn't,

715
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.240
but I'm a little too thin skinned for some of this stuff too because you know,

716
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.741
you're right,

717
00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:54.660
you get this stuff and they send you these notes or or emails or reviews or

718
00:38:54.661 --> 00:38:57.150
whatever.
Can they say stuff and you sit there and go,
okay,

719
00:38:57.151 --> 00:39:00.390
this isn't constructive criticism and y w I don't want to whine about this.

720
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.060
You kind of look and go,
what motivated you to do that?
Cause,

721
00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.890
but like you said,
I mean it's a cross section of human beings.

722
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.450
You don't know what mood they were in,

723
00:39:09.451 --> 00:39:11.820
what they've been drinking or anything else.
But at the same time you do,

724
00:39:11.821 --> 00:39:15.100
you kind of question,
you go,
is this what you do every day?
But it is,
you know,

725
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.330
it is

726
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.640
<v 0>with some of this and with some,</v>

727
00:39:16.641 --> 00:39:20.660
they just all of a sudden decide that Dan Carlin needs a talking to and they get

728
00:39:20.661 --> 00:39:25.460
online and they start fucking getting crazy and you know,
it's,

729
00:39:25.461 --> 00:39:28.070
it's,
it's,
it's a weird way of communicating.

730
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.350
<v 2>We're also talking to kids more,
you know,
awesome.</v>

731
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:34.510
Talking to mental health people or we're talking to people that are in homes

732
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:36.160
that have that Internet that should not,

733
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.270
<v 0>oh,
I don't know about that,
but one of the best,</v>

734
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.020
how about that guy that got fired?
I remember that guy from,

735
00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:42.870
he was in Houston and uh,

736
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.910
he was a reddit poster and actually got fired from his job when they found out

737
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:52.270
who he was on reddit because apparently he would post like dead bodies and crazy

738
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.970
shit.
Shit.
Like really,
really freaky shit.

739
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:59.920
And 10,000 lines mean things who say like really vicious mean Shit.

740
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.880
And it turned out he was like a guy with like a family wife and kids.

741
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.300
<v 2>You were talking about this internet and how it's changing things and really I</v>

742
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:10.000
always try to point out how early we are in this whole thing development.

743
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.120
Think about though,
how it does empower people like that,
who ever,
I mean it's,

744
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.120
I mean we always talk about how great it is that we can do podcasts and that we

745
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:22.090
can talk to a huge audience through a microphone out of,

746
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:26.370
out of a room or whatever.
But it does the same thing for everyone there.

747
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.780
And it's interesting when you think about people who,

748
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.300
I mean they used to talk about the voiceless.

749
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:34.270
You'll read these histories about these people locked up in these dark buildings

750
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:36.560
and never got it there.
The voiceless,
not anymore.

751
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.230
<v 0>There's no voiceless.
It's not like the old days where someone could just,</v>

752
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:42.123
you know,

753
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.750
be a famous person like Elvis or something like that and no one ever can say

754
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:50.110
anything about him.
Like,
you know,
Elvis came over to my hotel room,

755
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.400
we eight 15 pills and shit in my mouth.
And you know these days,

756
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:57.340
like if something like that happens,
like someone's going to take pictures,

757
00:40:57.341 --> 00:41:01.270
they're going to put it up on Tmz Bank back in the day,
you know the,
there was,

758
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.230
there was people that had no voice,
they couldn't talk about anything.

759
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:08.200
They couldn't say this movie is pandering,
it's stupid.

760
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.680
It's treating you like you're an idiot.
They couldn't say like my new show,

761
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:16.420
like a lot of the criticisms I've read about my new show I agree with and I

762
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:20.380
think they're really valid and I think that people having the ability to do that

763
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.200
is important.
I don't like the fast editing.

764
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:26.320
I don't like some of the cheesy music.
I don't like the suspense,
the thrill.

765
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.990
That's the way they think.
They have to make TV shows though.

766
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.750
But as the show gets more and more popular,

767
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.010
hopefully we can show that that's not the case.

768
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.800
<v 3>But like it's like this constant battle of compromise.</v>

769
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:41.210
But what's important to me is that people were looking at it sort of a lot of

770
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:43.880
ways.
The same way I'm looking at it.
The things that they don't like about it.

771
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.310
I don't like about it.
So it's validating in a way.

772
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:48.200
Even though they're saying I suck.
It's like,

773
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.250
I know it kind of sucks in this way and I think there's a lot of great stuff

774
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:53.960
about it,
but we can fix the suck part.

775
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.280
The stuck part is just like everyone assumes that you have to do it this certain

776
00:41:58.281 --> 00:42:00.470
way because they've done it that way forever and they're scared.

777
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.770
But when you look at these comments and you read things online,

778
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.890
everyone bad,
crazy,

779
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.810
but also good and poignant in,
in,
in,
in people who have good points of view,

780
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.260
they'll point stuff out and you go,
this is undeniable.
Yes,
the,
you know,

781
00:42:15.261 --> 00:42:18.050
this is cheesy.
Yes.
This is a dumb way to do that.
Yes.

782
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:21.740
This is demeaning to people's intelligence.
These,
right.

783
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.610
I'll give you the example though of what I mean and I'm thinking about people in

784
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:30.290
the Pre-internet age that were both geniuses and dangerous as all get out and

785
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:33.800
were dangerous before the end of the perfect example and only you punk rockers

786
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:37.610
out there will know who I'm talking about here,
but Darby crash from the germs.

787
00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:41.390
Who was from he,
how dare you fuck knows what you're to be crashed.

788
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.140
And Darby crash was a genius,
a Weirdo genius.

789
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.320
And I remember he went on Rodney Bingenheimer show here in town in like 1979 and

790
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:55.841
started giving out the satellite codes so you could make free telephone calls

791
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.420
and he's on the radio announcing,
okay,
Naafi dial this number.

792
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:02.110
And so you could call it Pakistan and you won't have to pay a dime and hitting

793
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:04.580
it then this number and you dial this first and make sure you download one.

794
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.080
I mean,
imagine him on the Internet and every week it's like,
okay,

795
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:12.860
subversive podcast one on one.
I mean,
he'd be gone in like five minutes,

796
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:16.730
but you think about what those guys could achieve without an internet.

797
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.920
Now you've given a Darby crash of the germs and internet and it's crazy thing.

798
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.280
I mean we're,
we're calling the internet a thing like as if it's a,
you know,

799
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:30.410
but what it did was it was a next,
if you look at it like really cleanly,

800
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.750
it's instead of like labeling the internet,

801
00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.890
it's almost just like the next level of technology.
It's like,

802
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:41.540
it's just the ability to exchange information and then from there it's all that

803
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:43.430
information just taking off and growing.

804
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.920
Don't want you to think they're going to do that Internet though.
And,
okay.

805
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.620
And every time I say anything like this,
the real technophobes junk people,

806
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.630
actually,
no,
actually no,
you're talking about exactly.

807
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.370
But I mean the rumor has always been that they're going to create a commercially

808
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.070
oriented Internet and the one where ESPN can deliver their content,

809
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.150
everything and it'd be super rapid and no spam and no ads.

810
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:03.440
And then they'll have the other one.

811
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.230
We're all the spam and all the ads and it goes really slow and everything.

812
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:08.080
And that's where the Dan Carlin podcast will be.

813
00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:12.290
And it'll take 17 days to download my lady with all the spam and stuff that

814
00:44:12.291 --> 00:44:15.530
comes with it.
How could he make it slower than it is now?
They won't.

815
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:19.130
They'll speed up the other one and just looking at one to degrade.
That's okay.

816
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.910
I would way rather have what we have right now uncensored than anything that's

817
00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:27.770
fast and I think everybody in fast and stupid and they get it and you go,
hey,

818
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:29.240
check this out.
This is the internet,

819
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.040
but you would still want to be able to do what you're doing

820
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.970
<v 0>now is my point.</v>

821
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:36.240
You wouldn't want to switch over and become censored so you can move faster.

822
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.910
I don't think that's,
I think the other one we just slowed down.

823
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:43.590
It was slowly but surely overwhelmed with junk and spam violates the laws of

824
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.150
technological progression.

825
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.030
I think the fact that you even need a technophobe to tell me that,

826
00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:49.790
you could tell me that it's the,

827
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.600
I don't see how there could ever be any rational reason for a slowing in speeds

828
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:58.440
of Internet.
This the speeds.
It's a rhetorical mine.
If you're the government,

829
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:00.770
you're tired of these idiots on these pod kit on that,

830
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.740
but everything wouldn't you want to share?
Well,
but listen,

831
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:06.540
I know that the old TV networks and stuff,

832
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.950
they're not happy with the fact they've lost the monopoly over,
you know,

833
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.810
being the middle man for content.
If they've,
if you told them,
listen,

834
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:15.210
I have a plan that could put you back in the driver's seat.

835
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.230
You don't think they'd say,

836
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:18.410
oh I have a slot open up at 2:00 PM let's have a meeting.

837
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.300
I'd like to hear what you have to say.
No for a bunch of reasons.

838
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:23.910
Cause I would like to think that individually there realized that we'd be a

839
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:25.500
terrible thing for the human race.

840
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.040
But also as you've met all those guys and you know that that's how they think

841
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:33.330
about us enough to them individually to be caught up in something so dangerous.

842
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:36.960
Like when you start talking about something like a conspiracy that would involve

843
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:40.620
who knows how many thousands of people to slow down the Internet.
You know,

844
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:45.300
I mean it would be an insanely transparent venture.
No way you could hire me.

845
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:49.620
Pretend I'm coming in the meeting and I say in 1990 the average golden girls

846
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:54.280
episode that nobody cared about it all had 43 million people watching it.
Yeah,

847
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.630
you've got to blame that on direct TV as much as you have to blame it on

848
00:45:57.631 --> 00:46:01.950
anything else or cable or a k instant on demand television programming,

849
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.020
you know without that.
What about Netflix?

850
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.870
You can get any fucking show you want anytime you want.

851
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.480
With the kind of like speed that we have now.

852
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.130
I mean I don't have the fastest Internet at home,

853
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:15.060
but I stream from Netflix in HD like it's nothing.
It's super easy,

854
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.220
so essentially I don't need a network anymore.

855
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:21.150
They're just as much to blame for this whole thing as the Internet.

856
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:26.030
It's certainly a lot more fragmentation.
There's no blame.
Well there is.
It is.

857
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.440
It's a progression.
You offer a shit product,

858
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.730
you stuffed fucking commercials inside that shit product and you wonder why

859
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:34.640
people are looking elsewhere when all of a sudden they have.

860
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:39.140
I agree with that that way.
Of course,
thinking about the best example,

861
00:46:39.141 --> 00:46:42.180
I'm not talking about blame,
I'm talking about somebody saying,
listen,

862
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:45.360
I know you think the genie's out of the bottle,
but with my new plan,

863
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:49.360
I can put the genie back in the bottle so that,
I don't want to say any names.

864
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.220
Major media company number one,
two,
three,
and four or five.
You guys are,
I mean,

865
00:46:53.221 --> 00:46:56.220
look,
if you're talking about movies and stuff like that,

866
00:46:56.221 --> 00:46:59.970
are entertainment companies,
it's already just like three or four companies now.

867
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.610
I mean,
it's not the Joe Rogan or the Dan Carlin show,

868
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.800
but if you're talking about major media companies out there,

869
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:07.060
there used to be a ton,
and we're down to like three or four.

870
00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:09.750
Isn't that fascinating?
Because it's sort of like banks as well,

871
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:13.410
how the eating each other up,
but it's almost like a survival mechanism.

872
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:17.070
You realize they had almost recognize that they were too big,

873
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.090
and then as the landscape change,
they were forced to coalesce.

874
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.780
It's really kind of fascinating as a male dog,

875
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.240
but if you're a blockbuster movie maker and you're going to $200 million,

876
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:31.180
you can't scrape that.
Uh,
together very easily and not only that,

877
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:35.320
you have to make sure that all your fucking t's are crossed and all your i's are

878
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:38.680
dotted and everything is like really clean and appealing.

879
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:41.860
Like that's why I'm moving it like Avatar.
I've loved Avatar.

880
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:46.270
I thought it was a really fun movie but it's a perfect blockbuster moneymaker

881
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:49.840
movie cause there's no sex.
The violence is like most of his life.

882
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.770
Either bad guys get jacked or you know these alien things which you don't even

883
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.310
really identify with.
The story is like Pocahontas,

884
00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:59.470
it's a million other stories is dances with wolves.

885
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.990
It's a million other stories that had been done a thousand times before,

886
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:06.670
but it's done perfect.
That's a fucking $250 million movie.

887
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:07.570
That's a movie that they can,

888
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.410
but he's got to get a James Cameron type motherfucker that's knows how to do

889
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:14.680
those things perfect and can pull pulling those off.
But yeah,

890
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.514
in this day and age,

891
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.670
those are dying off slowly but surely it's harder and harder to make one of

892
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:19.570
those motherfuckers.

893
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.170
You don't know if you have an Avatar or an Ishtar until it comes out.

894
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.680
People don't even remember that.
Look,
that's a hell of a risk.
And Colin and I,

895
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.080
we're old folks that fucked.
Do you remember that?
Oh yeah,
they used to be,

896
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:35.100
but if every single [inaudible] world waterworld is another wire on the waves.

897
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.080
But there was one other one too.
What was the other one?

898
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:42.340
There was one other gigantic movie that was actually previous to that.

899
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:46.960
There was a,
God,
it wasn't a warrant.
Beatty movie.
Uh,
shreds was pretty,

900
00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:48.130
I mean red's is pretty bad,

901
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:51.880
but there was another one that they talked about as being as much of a colossal

902
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.980
failure as a,
as Ishtar.

903
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.370
It was one of those like movie Robert Redford or something.

904
00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.910
Some shit I would never watch.
You know,

905
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.160
when he falls in love with the girl who gets cancer or something,

906
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.290
I don't remember.
I don't remember those movies,
those,

907
00:49:05.291 --> 00:49:08.810
those types of movies like this where the music would play.

908
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.800
Robert Redford look at these girls and it's like steely glance.

909
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:15.640
I know they're good,
but I'm not watching that shit.
My Dad,
my dad,

910
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:20.670
my dad made movies and he made movies that costs like $200,000 to make.

911
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.620
He spent like a million dollars on promotion.

912
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.820
He released them in like a physician theaters all at once and by the time you

913
00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:30.490
realized that no one should have gone to that movie,

914
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.710
he made all his money back and then sold it overseas.
So that was the,

915
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:35.481
what was the move?

916
00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:40.481
That and that and that was the playbook was shark Nino was that they make that

917
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:44.830
for Scifi or they made it specifically.
Yeah,
it's a brilliant move,
man.

918
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.740
Just go over the top,
make something completely retarded.

919
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.280
Did you see Insr and flying through the air inside the shark's mouth,

920
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.420
the sharks flying through the air.
I had jumps up with a chainsaw.

921
00:49:55.421 --> 00:49:59.740
It goes inside the shark and cuts his way out the chain.
It's on my to do,

922
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.650
they're already making a sequel and yards.
Funny Shit.

923
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:05.320
And Ian's the only one that's going to be back in it and they know they're on a

924
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.900
Terry today.
She should get back.
She's crazy.
Get back in there.

925
00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:11.430
Have your agent could kiss their ass,
end up sending a gift basket shark ate,

926
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.050
or as the,
the idea of,
uh,

927
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.370
making your own like really terrible movies on purpose.
It's great idea.

928
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.410
Let's do it.
I think,
I absolutely think,

929
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:22.000
especially in this day and age with all the weed,

930
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.860
but everybody having access to weed those movies became infinitely more popular.

931
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.110
Like Sharknado sober is not the best movie to watch,

932
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.530
but if you're high as fuck when you have two or more friends over,

933
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.980
you're going to have a great time.
That's a party.
I'm,

934
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.120
I'm advocating marijuana and shark NATO together.
People like,
what are you doing?

935
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.710
Are you advocating marijuana use Donald?

936
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:46.190
Only that I'm advocating marijuana use wild watching shark Nino.

937
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.820
I think that's an important statement.
Don't be scared.
Pitches

938
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.680
those tell terrible television shows.
They're fun.

939
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.140
There's a reason when they make them up bad on purpose.

940
00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.140
But then there's like subtle ones.
Like I've argued with people about,
um,

941
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.570
Werner Herzog's a grizzly man.

942
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.820
Dunkin thinks that Werner absolutely knew that he was making a comedy as he was

943
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:11.540
making it and just used his narration.
And you know,

944
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:14.510
tried to like make it dramatic and legitimate,

945
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.360
but new while he was doing it that he was making a comedy.

946
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.720
There's a part of me that wonders if Jack Webb didn't know those dragnets that

947
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:24.500
he was making sure that those were fucking,

948
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.700
there's still,
there's still hilarious,

949
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:33.020
the kind of the statements that he would say and the way he talked and just go

950
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.280
pull some of those up because Larry Dragnet

951
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.280
<v 4>68 grizzly man though to like normal people that aren't comics and you don't</v>

952
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.480
give them any kind of precursor laugh.

953
00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.630
They know they don't come back thinking like,
oh my God,
that guy was gay.

954
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.520
That's so fake.
They like,

955
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.860
cause I know a few people that said it well when I said that,

956
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.540
they're always like,
oh yeah,
I guess you're right.
Yeah,
he was kind of,
come on,

957
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.380
man.
Everybody watched that.
You knew he was good.

958
00:51:56.381 --> 00:51:57.800
I think we just hang out with people that,

959
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.180
that are in the entertainment industry more so that we're all kind of thinking

960
00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:05.740
shit like this.
No,
maybe,
I don't know.

961
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:06.360
Maybe,

962
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.340
<v 0>but I,
I feel like when I watched grizzly man,</v>

963
00:52:08.341 --> 00:52:11.520
I mean the guy's holding a camera and he's walking around and talking to the

964
00:52:11.521 --> 00:52:13.470
camera and one of the things he's saying is,

965
00:52:13.471 --> 00:52:17.010
I wish I was gay because if I was gay,
I could just go to a truck stop.

966
00:52:17.011 --> 00:52:20.490
I could just hook up with a guy,
but I'm not gay.
So what do I do?

967
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.410
And me personally,

968
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:26.220
I've always felt like anybody who's walking in the woods talking to a camera

969
00:52:26.221 --> 00:52:29.310
saying,
I'm not gay,
it's 99% gay.

970
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.860
There's psychological formula you can follow.

971
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.620
But he just not something that a heterosexual person says,

972
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.200
unless you get called gay a lot in your whole life.

973
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.290
And he's by himself in the woods,
man by himself in the woods,

974
00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:43.490
walk with a camera talking about why can't meet a woman and the motherfuckers

975
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:48.060
sleeping.
Flophouse exactly.
Sleeping into cloth,

976
00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:50.290
house following monsters.
You know,

977
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.710
<v 4>we just found out how you got that mixed breed with the Sasquatch and the,</v>

978
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:55.544
you know,

979
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.240
<v 0>how did you get the mixed breed?
Well,</v>

980
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.270
we finally find the guy in the forest who couldn't meet a girl and then we'll

981
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.950
fuck to bear just some female Sasquatch.

982
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.140
It was basically suicide by bears,
what it was.

983
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.970
But you know,
I'll just,
we're getting off the point here,
the talk much history,

984
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.420
but we are sort of,
cause we're kind of setting it up.
Okay.

985
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:21.340
Even though this is like,
look,
I love talking to you about anything,
but we,

986
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.920
we got to talk about some history where people are going to be mad at us.

987
00:53:23.921 --> 00:53:24.610
That's right.
Yeah.

988
00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:29.030
But I think that in a sense we're kind of setting it up because with all this,

989
00:53:29.031 --> 00:53:32.220
uh,
this madness,
whether it's Anthony Wiener or whether it's,
uh,

990
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.970
the NSA spying on us and justifying it.
W W all this madness,

991
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:41.390
it's the human animal is only really been aware of how crazy we are for the last

992
00:53:41.531 --> 00:53:42.540
like few hundred years.

993
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.890
We've only been like paying attention and writing things down for the last few

994
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:47.190
thousand years.

995
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.580
And over the last few hundred years we like slowly but surely been like,

996
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.290
oh my God.
Like we're fucking crazy.

997
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.920
But I think today is a really unique time to,

998
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:57.810
for all the reasons why we were talking about before,

999
00:53:57.811 --> 00:54:00.210
especially with the Internet and having this access to information.

1000
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:05.211
Having things like your podcast today is like the most unique time ever to like

1001
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:10.890
look at all this information about the past and sort of sum it up in this old

1002
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:12.240
people are just nuts.

1003
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:16.710
Like there's never been a point in time ever in human history where there was

1004
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:21.711
peace on the whole earth for like a week or a month or a year.

1005
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.470
Even though we'd like to think of ourselves as being inherently good and noble

1006
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:26.880
and there's a few bad apples out there.

1007
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.810
There's never been a time ever where people were nice to each other,

1008
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:34.470
just universally like a PR.
Like here,
if it was just us,

1009
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.990
I always use this example,
but it was just the four of us and we had a,

1010
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.620
we had our own civilization and we lived on an island or we lived somewhere

1011
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:44.340
where there was no fighting over resources.
I'm pretty sure we'd get along great,

1012
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.000
you know?
I mean,
we're special force him though.
Really,

1013
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.470
you might try to fuck Brian after a while.

1014
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:54.500
I've seen that you mean you mean something might happen sexually but most likely

1015
00:54:55.231 --> 00:55:00.090
not and most likely we would all be very friendly and coexist for a long time on

1016
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:01.980
that island with no issues.
Okay.

1017
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.450
But why is that not the case when it comes to 4 million people are 4 billion

1018
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:08.630
people or 4 trillion,
whatever the,

1019
00:55:08.631 --> 00:55:13.631
the the than the number of eventually becomes we s we can ever hold large groups

1020
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:19.101
together without some really senseless shit happening and some regrettable stuff

1021
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:22.680
happening.
And when you,
when you look at history,

1022
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:27.330
when you talk about like the Roman Empire or you talk about Martin Luther and

1023
00:55:27.331 --> 00:55:31.410
when you talk about these people that existed just a few hundred years ago,

1024
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.120
just not that long ago,

1025
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.830
but they're living like they're in a mad world that's in a movie,

1026
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.220
that thing I didn't hide.
First of all,
I knew nothing about Lutherism.
I didn't,

1027
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:44.280
I never had heard of,
I mean I knew what it was.
I saw it on churches,

1028
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.210
but I have no idea what the philosophy was and that it's based on Martin Luther

1029
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:53.010
is based on this guy with the balls to actually like post notes complaining

1030
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:57.300
about the Church and print them at that time where they weren't that cool about

1031
00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.590
killing people,

1032
00:55:58.591 --> 00:56:01.920
killing people who are doing that cool about no complaint department.

1033
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:05.880
But what is the name of that podcast?
Uh,
God,
you can't do that to me.
Uh,

1034
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:09.180
that one is called,
I'll find it on my head and look at a problem.

1035
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:13.590
The profits and profits of doom never go backwards.
I never looked back.
Listen,

1036
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.220
I understand.
Totally.
And for a guy who works as much as you do,

1037
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:21.020
people might think that that's an excuse.
But I know about the human memory.

1038
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.080
Well,
no,
listen,
when we would,

1039
00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:25.420
<v 3>Brian and I do with this podcast,</v>

1040
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.220
we show up five minutes before we smoke a joint.

1041
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:29.200
We talked a little shit and then we were role.

1042
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.840
What you do is it should even be called a podcast.

1043
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:33.450
It's a completely different experience.

1044
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.360
People think I wait until the law cause it like writing,
come on,
good old.

1045
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:39.940
They think I'm just sitting around and then all of a sudden let me explain it to

1046
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:42.550
me.
Let me make him wait another week.
Let me explain to me though,

1047
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:46.900
if you're a podcast fan and you like if you enjoy this podcast,
first of all,

1048
00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:48.990
thank you.
We enjoy you too.
Um,

1049
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:52.360
but second of all like what he does is not a podcast.

1050
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:57.010
It's like an audio presentation and they're a long well the his stomach.

1051
00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.760
Yes.
What if one of them,
the most recent one I'm into,
let me,

1052
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.700
I'll pull up the name of it because you started off by talking about,

1053
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:07.300
this isn't really a podcast,
an audio book.

1054
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.210
This is essentially an audio book.
Do you know which one that was?

1055
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.520
I'll tell you the last five probably.

1056
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.710
It is.
No,
it's not wrath of the con man.

1057
00:57:17.711 --> 00:57:20.730
I played that so much.
You like Mars angels.

1058
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.630
Of course.
I just hit you with a nerve cause you're a Mongol file too.

1059
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:27.680
I've got a problem.
I've got a real problem with,

1060
00:57:27.681 --> 00:57:31.420
they've been in a motorcycle gang.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I,
um,

1061
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:36.450
I listened to your Mongo podcast at least four or five times all the way over.

1062
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:41.360
The Joe Rogan stopped telling Joe Rogan to talk about your mom podcasts on it.

1063
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:47.080
I talked to this poor comedic woman about it and you said something and there

1064
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:48.220
was,
we went back to her,

1065
00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:51.970
there's this long dead silence where she tried to absorb what you just told her.

1066
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.940
Who was that?
Who Do you think that would have been female comedian?
She said,

1067
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:58.600
I've got a show on costumer.
Yeah.
That's most likely to buy it.

1068
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:02.200
And there's this long pause.
Like what do I say after that?
Yeah.
I went,

1069
00:58:02.201 --> 00:58:03.790
I hit Amy Schumer with some fucking crazy.

1070
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.630
She's awesome.
Well,
you know,
we would though one of the images that you painted,

1071
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.230
that's to me what,
like whenever,
when people talk about,
um,

1072
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:18.160
the Mongols and I've had conversations with people where it's been brought up

1073
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:22.540
about the Ganga is Khan Dna thing that Dan Gingiss cons Dnas and some insane

1074
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:24.750
percentage of maybe that's been challenged.

1075
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.050
Well and not his specifically,
but his,
his family,

1076
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.620
his sons had admitted mean just more and more and more wives.

1077
00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:35.410
And they had a lot of wives anyway.
And you know,
uh,
uh,

1078
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.820
it's possible in certain areas like they can go into places like Afghanistan and

1079
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:43.000
there were a whole populations there where there's just a huge amount of people

1080
00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:45.920
you can trace to his family.
They would,

1081
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:50.020
they would leave these garrisons to keep these places pacified.
And it's like,

1082
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:52.900
what I always tell those people about the Mongols are so tolerant and they had

1083
00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:55.330
these and any religion and they whole things.
I said,
yeah,

1084
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:58.750
they were tolerant if you gave in and giving in kind of meant,
okay,

1085
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:02.440
you have a beautiful daughter,
she's mine now.
Well,
they're tolerant.
I mean,

1086
00:59:02.441 --> 00:59:04.570
Hitler was tolerant if you gave in.
Yeah.

1087
00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:09.130
What they didn't enforce is an ideology because they didn't give a fuck.

1088
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:11.380
Romans didn't either,
hey,
pay your taxes.

1089
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.720
I don't care what weird religion you're a part of it,
you know?

1090
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:14.980
And if you don't worship the emperor,

1091
00:59:14.981 --> 00:59:18.280
you're in big trouble idea that that is what's important.

1092
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:21.980
Not the fact that they were the most murderous the world

1093
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.280
<v 0>has ever known.
When you said,
and I,
I couldn't believe this,</v>

1094
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:29.360
I had a pause my fucking computer and I had to go online and find verification

1095
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:34.510
when you were saying that they might have killed between 50 and 80 [inaudible]

1096
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:39.410
during the period of Gingiss cons,
life by fucking horseback.

1097
00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:43.800
<v 4>You're not his life,
but he and his,
his up to his grandchildren,
grandchildren.
Oh,</v>

1098
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:48.740
okay.
I want to tell the audience,
I get this phone call one night and it's,

1099
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:52.250
I can hear the wind through his ears and it's Joe Rogan go.

1100
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:53.570
Did you just use them?

1101
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:58.030
<v 0>Bill Cosby skid in the middle of talking about Genghis Khan?
No,</v>

1102
00:59:58.031 --> 01:00:02.710
not a skit.
No.
You had a correct,
brilliant analogy.
I go,
how awesome.
I you,
you,

1103
01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:07.711
he talked about bill Cosby raising his children and how bill Cosby grew up poor

1104
01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:11.160
in Philadelphia,
but it's children grew up the,
the children,

1105
01:00:11.161 --> 01:00:15.060
one of the most loved man ever rich,
rich beyond recognition.

1106
01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:18.780
I mean real bill Cosby's got a fucking billion dollars and then you compared

1107
01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:23.400
that to get his cars.
Kids were kingus,
Khan grew up,
they were

1108
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:29.280
beautiful depictions of people wearing mouse skin clothes,

1109
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.450
like there were so poor,

1110
01:00:30.451 --> 01:00:33.600
they had field mice that they would skin and turn them into clothes.

1111
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.180
So you definitely this crazy person coming at you with

1112
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.200
<v 4>hail in the snow to school both ways.
I mean it was that,</v>

1113
01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:46.570
but you know,
comparing that to bill Cosby was brilliant.
It was so fun.
I just,

1114
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:50.840
when I talk about,
uh,
Theodore Roosevelt and how the,
uh,

1115
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.150
every little American kids favorite president is Theodore Roosevelt because

1116
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:57.420
Theodore Roosevelt is like a kid.
And one guy said when he was president said,

1117
01:00:57.421 --> 01:01:00.540
you must always remember the president is about six.

1118
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.940
And so I compared him,
you know,

1119
01:01:02.941 --> 01:01:05.810
as always wanting to go on these adventures as being like,
you know,
and,

1120
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.580
and by the standards of our time now,
he was a racist.
He was at,

1121
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.710
when they say about six,
they would say that about him.

1122
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.550
He was about six [inaudible] well but,
but,

1123
01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.700
but so I didn't want to say he was racist because by the time he was considered

1124
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.020
progressive on race,

1125
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:21.840
but by today's standards he make Archie bunker looked like a liberal.

1126
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.760
So I always said he's like,

1127
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:28.910
he's like a heavily armed imperialistic racist version of Peter Pan and Larry

1128
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:33.210
are,
you have this image of Teddy Roosevelt with the little glasses and the buck

1129
01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.820
teeth,
the mustache and bullying,

1130
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.980
bullying Peter Pan Leading you off to war on a great adventure in Spain.
Yeah.

1131
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.960
He would like get in fist fights and shit.
Right?
Oh,
for the fun of it.
He used to,

1132
01:01:42.961 --> 01:01:44.360
he used to,
he used to buy,

1133
01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:48.450
I mean the guy was blind in one eye later in his life because he would box in

1134
01:01:48.451 --> 01:01:53.070
the White House because that's to me a manly thing to do to block and went and

1135
01:01:53.071 --> 01:01:55.440
lived on a dude ranch because he thought that,
you know,

1136
01:01:55.441 --> 01:01:57.840
you need to hang out with cowboys and mountain men and stuff.

1137
01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.191
<v 0>You know,</v>

1138
01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:03.020
he had one of the first depictions of Sasquatch in one of his books.

1139
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:07.190
You know that one of his books,
someone got killed by a wild man,

1140
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm sure you would like to hunt Sasquatches head on the wall.

1141
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:14.210
And that's like one of the,
when the,
the Sasquatch nutters,

1142
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.280
when they use a information,

1143
01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:18.290
when they start talking to me about stories that people have told,

1144
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:20.190
that's one of them.
They tell with great

1145
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.110
<v 2>glee,
the Teddy Roosevelt Sasquatch story.
And you know,</v>

1146
01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.170
Teddy Roosevelt read about Sasquatch and one of his dad's body is telling you,

1147
01:02:26.171 --> 01:02:28.440
you'll see one of his camps,
it's hunting camps.

1148
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:31.320
One of the men that was with him was killed by wild man.
Well,

1149
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.460
I'm sure a story from the 1940s holds up liking

1150
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:40.110
whatever it was.
I'm sure it holds up like a month while I was high off,

1151
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:45.350
holds up like a motherfucker in 2013 like you couldn't tell me a Sasquatch story

1152
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.370
from a month ago and I believe you got it right.

1153
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.720
You tell me about a guy who got killed by a wild monkey man and the early 19th

1154
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:54.120
century or 20th century.
The,
um,

1155
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.210
the story that we were talking about before the podcast,
I said,
you gotta stop,

1156
01:02:57.211 --> 01:02:58.150
you gotta stop.
Gotta stop.

1157
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:03.530
It was about the Michael Crighton movie based on a real life encounter with

1158
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:07.860
humans in the Anatol.
A buddy of mine gave me that book,

1159
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:10.920
it's called eaters of the dead a long time ago.

1160
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.380
And what the author Michael Crighton didn't he right.
Jurrasic park and stuff.

1161
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.010
So he had found,
and it's something that historians know about,
uh,

1162
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.780
a manuscript written by a Muslim guy and like the 10th century,

1163
01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:26.700
the Khalif sends this guy out to explore lands in a specific direction and he

1164
01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:29.460
writes about all the people that he meets.
So,
you know,
he goes a little north,

1165
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:31.920
he writes about the people in the southern Russia.
It keeps going.
He keeps going.

1166
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:34.710
Eventually he gets,
you know,
at one point he writes about whales,

1167
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.880
but he doesn't know what a whale is.

1168
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:40.530
So he's in this book trying to describe a whale and Crighton takes this guy's

1169
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:45.150
original manuscript and sort of adds to it and writes a little connecting
pieces.

1170
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:46.470
But at one point in the story,

1171
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.180
this guy who will get his head cut off by the Khalif if he lies.
So the,

1172
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.750
the general understanding is that there wasn't a lot of exaggeration going on

1173
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:57.510
here because this guy was kind of tell the truth or I'll kill you.

1174
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.720
He makes it to Sweden during the Viking era and gives us really the only good

1175
01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:07.800
written description of like the Swedish vikings known as the Reus and,

1176
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.250
and I don't know where Crighton begins in the story leaves off.

1177
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:14.070
So don't quote me on this,
but this Swedes,

1178
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:18.540
or having some kind of war that Michael Crighton has it interpreted that it's

1179
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:23.541
like this Swedish vikings against the last tribe of neanderthals pushed up

1180
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:25.290
against the frozen north.
You know,

1181
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.900
people have been pushing them out of the good areas forever.

1182
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.020
And the last bastion is up here in the frozen north and they'll,

1183
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:33.090
Swedish vikings are constantly at war with them.

1184
01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:35.670
And that's what the 13th warrior movies about and all that.

1185
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:40.850
But the actual text is fascinating to read and it's a true historical text.

1186
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.800
I mean,
the guy's name is like even five lean or something.

1187
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:47.550
My Muslim pronunciations are always off,
but,
but it's fascinating stuff.
And,

1188
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:50.670
and found this and just said this is better than anything anybody could write.

1189
01:04:50.671 --> 01:04:54.510
I mean it's wonderful stuff,
but I think they,
they butchered it for the movie,

1190
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:58.270
right?
Oh yeah,
no,
they know.
Even the book is Crighton you know,

1191
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.540
plays around the margins.
But yeah,
I didn't even see the movie once.
I,

1192
01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:07.541
Antonio Banderas and I knew tell you this is a bad motherfucker for a long

1193
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:07.940
period,

1194
01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.520
but not with a sword and armor and Melanie Griffin cries and your shoulder for

1195
01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:15.210
the thousandth time.
You're like,
okay,
I can't make the Zombie plays a good cat.

1196
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.010
He's like a piece of bad motherfucker.
Another spy kids movie.

1197
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.260
<v 3>The um,
the,
the movie was like,</v>

1198
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:22.600
they were wearing outfits and then work like cannibals.

1199
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:28.180
They fucked the whole thing up because the movie looked like they were monsters.

1200
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.860
It looked like when you watched it,

1201
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:31.750
like the previews and they showed you the clips,

1202
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:35.560
it looked like these guys were going up against these cannibal monsters that

1203
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:39.040
would eat people.
And that's what you thought about even saying,
you know,

1204
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.980
he would write in the Italian,
so the regular thing would be all print,

1205
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:44.800
the original report,
and then then you could see the word workrite and would say,

1206
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:47.860
what the heck is he talking about?
Here are these neanderthals.
And that's,

1207
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.620
that's kind of how they came about.
And you kind of,

1208
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:51.640
if you're going to make a movie,

1209
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:55.480
like they did a movie that I hated on the Greek and Persian wars,

1210
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:57.560
that one 300 with the Spartans,
you know,

1211
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.080
hated 300 by him over man thing.

1212
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.350
I had a guy,

1213
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:08.230
another history guy who was so mad at all the inaccuracies of the Persians,

1214
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:11.350
right?
Making them look like the monsters.
And I said,
but you know what I mean?

1215
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:13.270
I can see how the the director,

1216
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:17.500
if you were trying to make it look as weird to you,

1217
01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:21.370
the viewer as it must have looked to the Greeks at the time,

1218
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:24.490
that then you would have to exaggerate because if you showed the Persians as

1219
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:27.400
they really are to our,
you're going,
okay,
what's the big deal?
They look right,

1220
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:31.720
but if you want to the Greeks,
these were really exotic freaky thing.

1221
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.330
So if you want to make it look as freaky to you,

1222
01:06:34.331 --> 01:06:36.880
the viewing audience as it looked to the Spartans,

1223
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:41.590
you would have to make it more monsters and more wicked and wild.
And so that's,

1224
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.200
I tried to explain it to my buddy.
For us,
it was,
to me,

1225
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:48.140
the reason I hated is because the story itself is so mind blowing.

1226
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:51.320
Don't screw it up with all that other stuff.
But yeah.
But,

1227
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.540
but that's a really interesting perspective that I hadn't considered.

1228
01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:57.880
If you want to make it as weird to you as it was to them,
you have to make it.

1229
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.380
Yeah.
Well,
when the,
yeah,

1230
01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:03.580
I guess if you have very limited access to the reality of the world as far as

1231
01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:06.750
information goes,
and you see these guys coming over in elephants with,

1232
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.430
you would really think that there's,
oh,
and then,

1233
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.760
and they thought all that stuff from Persia was exotic and decadent.
Weird.

1234
01:07:12.761 --> 01:07:15.310
And you know,
it's fucking beautiful movie.
I love that movie.

1235
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:18.400
It was so much fun visual comic book,
right?
Yes.
Exactly.

1236
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.380
See that's what I've liked.
Those movies,

1237
01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:22.570
like people will like poke holes in Avatar.

1238
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.320
I think Avatar is also a visual comic book.
But there's a difference.

1239
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:29.350
And I have this,
I don't have any problem with a story like that.
Right.

1240
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:35.560
Cause like when Oliver Stone doesn't move you like the doors or the j I want to

1241
01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:37.660
just,
I don't know.
I can't say I want to kill all it.
There's no,

1242
01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:39.040
but I mean it makes you angry cause you just,

1243
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.530
or like when he did Alexander the Great,
oh my God.

1244
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.520
And then you find out that Martin Scorsese had wanted to do Alexander the Great

1245
01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:49.000
and then stopped because Oliver Stone was doing and you go,
oh my God.

1246
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:50.950
And you know why?
Because,
because Alexander,

1247
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:52.780
his whole life is like a mafia crime family.

1248
01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:56.500
And you think what better director than Martin Scorsese and you put Joe Pesci in

1249
01:07:56.501 --> 01:08:01.330
it and you know,
fantastic.
And no,
he has to stop because you know,

1250
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:04.630
what does this brand the equal to 300 that's coming out?
Oh it is?
Yeah.

1251
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:08.980
When is it coming out?
I think next year.
Oh,
I'm so happy now.

1252
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:13.120
I love the idea of these times,
man.

1253
01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:17.450
And obviously this is a lot of fuckery fun and you know,
fantasy and monsters.

1254
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.630
They are wild.
There was wild.
I love that era too.

1255
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:24.260
It's my favorite is just the idea of these movies is so fun.

1256
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.410
We're way past the time on the podcast and,
and unfortunately I'm going to do,

1257
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:30.020
I think that me telling you all here for the first time,

1258
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.570
I think we're going to do another big modern series,

1259
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.760
but then I'm going back to the ancient world.

1260
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:38.780
It's my first law than we'd been away from there for mom to me Mongols or later

1261
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.890
history.
I mean,
I love that BC stuff.
Do you really?
I love it.
Wow.

1262
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:46.880
It's another world.
The Martin Luther's story,
which we sort of touched upon.
Um,

1263
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:50.240
but we,
we didn't really go any further.
We've got sort of sidetracked.

1264
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.110
What's Waco in Germany?
That's the math.

1265
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.600
That's what Waco could have been had it been a huge,
bigger story.

1266
01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:00.830
But what's fascinating about it to me was that Martin Luther has these ideas.

1267
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:02.180
He's this legitimate guy.

1268
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:07.130
And he also takes the Bible and translates it so people can read it.

1269
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.610
He takes the Bible and translates it phonetically for the longest time,

1270
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:13.730
and I wasn't aware of this,
people couldn't read the Bible.

1271
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.750
They had to go to church and the priest had to tell them what was in the Bible.

1272
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:18.980
People got mad at me too when I said it.
A couple of,
you know,

1273
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:22.220
you had a lot of biblical scholars out there and they gave me the whole thing

1274
01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:24.380
about what you had this the vulgate Bible and level.

1275
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:27.860
But basically though it's a true statement,
which is that most people,

1276
01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:29.660
especially in places like Germany,

1277
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.540
are not reading Latin during this time period because they're not,

1278
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.940
they're not reading anything basically.
And of course,

1279
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:38.370
Latin itself is just there that's translated.

1280
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.330
It's not even alive language at that time.
You know,

1281
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.670
you'd say it's a dead language.
Now.

1282
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:47.030
There weren't a lot of people outside the church walking around speaking Latin

1283
01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:50.810
on the streets and it's translated another dead language and ancient Hebrew.

1284
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.810
So there's ancient Greek,
they weren't even Hebrew to Greek,
Greek to Latin,

1285
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.610
and not always gap.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
I'm not going there with you.

1286
01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.690
There's people that study this stuff all day.
The idea is first,

1287
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:03.561
first and foremost,

1288
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:06.410
that Martin Luther was one of the very first people to distribute this

1289
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:06.990
information,

1290
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:11.930
dangerous information and make it so that people would know what's actually in

1291
01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:16.520
the Bible and it was a big controversy about whether the people could handle it

1292
01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.190
without a middle man to interpret it for them.

1293
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:23.060
Because think about this is this is hard for modern people because even when you

1294
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:25.400
truly believe the Bible is the word of God,

1295
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:29.840
you're still living in this modern civilization where you no doubt is out there

1296
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:32.570
and you know it.
It still influences you even on a subconscious level.

1297
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.920
Whereas these people,

1298
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:38.870
if you really believe 100% know if Sandra and everybody around you did too.

1299
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:42.710
You lived in a culture where everybody believes that this is exact the exact

1300
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:43.281
word of God,

1301
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:47.720
and now these scholars whom you trust are telling you to interpret it for

1302
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:48.351
yourself.

1303
01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:51.590
That idiot who wrote the negative reviews on the Internet from the insane asylum

1304
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.680
is told,
hey,
you too can interpret this for yourself.

1305
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.940
And then what's going to,
and the Catholic church was in a moment of,

1306
01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:02.600
we have to say real sanity here going that could be a little dangerous,

1307
01:11:02.601 --> 01:11:06.950
don't you think?
Well they knew it was a quantum leap.
It was a historical moment.

1308
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.760
You know,
it was almost like a,
not a catastrophe,

1309
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:14.220
like a nine 11 but a historical moment of that significance for all of a sudden

1310
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.710
it's hard for us to believe and understand exactly.

1311
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.970
But people having the opportunity to read the Bible was as huge burst of change

1312
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:25.280
that's spread through these communities.
When you think that you've been lied to,

1313
01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.450
which all of a sudden a bunch of people are like,
wait a minute,

1314
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.360
why didn't they tell me?
No,
you're keeping the,
what do we compare it to?

1315
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:34.890
In that episode we said if aliens came to us and they had the real word of God

1316
01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:38.260
and they said,
we have the real word of God and you're like,
oh my Lord.
Oh good.

1317
01:11:38.261 --> 01:11:39.210
Fantastic.
And they said,

1318
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.680
but you can't read it cause it's an alien will tell you what it says.
I mean,

1319
01:11:43.681 --> 01:11:46.710
that's kind of one of the things I secretly love about your podcast.
You,

1320
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:50.470
you'll bring up that alien scenario.
Why is it so great?

1321
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.220
The alien and everybody says it's a drinking game.
Wednesday,

1322
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:56.490
once Dan mentions aliens,
I know you brought,
you brought that up.

1323
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.970
Now I'm playing with and you know what I was supposed to bring with me today,

1324
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:04.140
some ointment with a fly in it because apparently the last time I was here,

1325
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:07.800
I used the term fly in the ointment about 700 times.

1326
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.980
And I go back to home and my buddy goes,
you never use,

1327
01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:14.610
I've never heard you use that phrase ever.
And I go and he said,
look at,

1328
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.030
look at Rogan's discussion board.
Fly in the ointment flight.
What's it?

1329
01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.830
What the fly in the ointment.
The fly in the ointment.
You know?
And I thought,

1330
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.710
that's gonna be my catch phrase now I'm just going to adopt it.
Embrace it.

1331
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:26.660
You know,
you haven't said it once.
Have I have,
I Brian,
you know,

1332
01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:29.160
fly in the ointment this time.
Get to know who you got on the show.

1333
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:33.010
That's hilarious.
That that's what they got out of that discussion.
Well,

1334
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.630
I know there deep,
you know,
um,
the,
the Martin Luther thing,

1335
01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:39.810
what's fascinating to me is Martin Luther had some ideas,

1336
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:45.050
but then these really radical Pete bill took his ideas and when way further they

1337
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:49.800
went full on,
no one has private property,
you know,

1338
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:51.420
like some sort of communism,

1339
01:12:51.421 --> 01:12:56.070
socialism agenda and I'm going to fuck all the women like they went.
So we did.

1340
01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:00.280
That is what happens whenever.
Okay.
It's a easy guy.
Gets a control.

1341
01:13:00.281 --> 01:13:04.230
A plus B equals I'm the Messiah and I can have all your wives.
I mean,
it just,

1342
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:05.880
it's almost an algebraic expression.

1343
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.970
I know you're all starving to death and I have plenty of food,
but seriously,

1344
01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:10.830
I'm supposed to be that way.
Well,

1345
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:12.690
you know what's really funny is if you look at history,

1346
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:15.190
that's that exact thing has happened.
Oh yeah.
I know.

1347
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.960
And what I love about it is it's always we have to get back to the way it really

1348
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:23.370
was with Jesus.
Was Jesus doing that or I don't remember Jesus saying,

1349
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.400
and all your wives are mine.
They throw that in.

1350
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:29.030
It's just like Jesus and all your wives are mind.

1351
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:33.120
It always happens like the Waco guys.
Yeah,
but,

1352
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:36.600
but it's happened like 500 yeah.

1353
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.960
The Way Jeffrey's guy,
they all do it and there was a bunch of the,
the the,

1354
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.980
I don't go here.
The one thing I mentioned something,

1355
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:47.370
I'm going to get 10,000 people even before this period in Hungary,

1356
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:50.430
there was a bunch of these free love movements and they based it all on the,

1357
01:13:50.431 --> 01:13:54.450
you know,
all this stuff does the guy in Siberia that says he's Jesus as he bang

1358
01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:58.320
everybody.
I don't know the guy in Siberia,
you don't know this guy.
Oh my God.

1359
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:02.580
Vice did an incredible documentary on him.
He's got a village up there.

1360
01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:07.230
I mean have a large village where there's many,
many,
many people,

1361
01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:09.210
hundreds and hundreds of people.
I don't know how many,

1362
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.730
it might be more than a thousand that in his community and the all of these

1363
01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:16.690
homes set up and they all show up in these meetings and churches and this guy

1364
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:18.910
like lives on a hill.
He's just like,
Jeez,
Jesus,

1365
01:14:18.911 --> 01:14:22.060
that Jesus from Siberia and he comes down,
he blesses them,

1366
01:14:22.061 --> 01:14:25.990
he goes back up to his house and they all like sing songs and eat dinner

1367
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.490
together and grow food.
No,

1368
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:31.840
I believe truly believe that this predates Jesus.

1369
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:33.040
That this is a human thing.

1370
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.610
That there are either people are born with this genetic makeup or somebody

1371
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:40.270
figured out a really great scam a long time ago that said,
you know,

1372
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:45.250
I could just be either God or the Prophet of God and this would really work out

1373
01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:46.950
well for me.
What am I going to do for a living?
Ah,

1374
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.770
it all looks terrible in hardware.
I could be a profit.
And like I said,

1375
01:14:50.771 --> 01:14:53.950
I think you could go long before Christianity and see these people running

1376
01:14:53.951 --> 01:14:57.610
around saying,
uh,
I'm not a witch doctor.
I'm the son of God.

1377
01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:00.400
Then it goes right back to,
to bring it up again,

1378
01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:04.960
the Alpha male primate instincts that have sort of flavored the,

1379
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:08.260
the very progress,
the,
the,
the need to conquer,
sort of flavored,

1380
01:15:08.261 --> 01:15:10.270
the very progress.
It all goes back to the same thing.

1381
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.160
It's like one crazy thing that wants to run the whole Bot group of other people.

1382
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:16.240
It's always the same.

1383
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.200
It's like when you look at how freaky things get when people start questioning,

1384
01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.330
I mean like,
like the whole story of his real name is Amenhotep the fourth,

1385
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:27.780
but [inaudible] is the way he's known in history though.

1386
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.120
The supposedly the first monotheist a an Egyptian Pharaoh that decided that

1387
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:38.551
there's only one God in an era where Egypt had an extremely powerful priestly

1388
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:42.550
class and for ronic times who ran everything,
they were like the civil servants,

1389
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:44.080
the bureaucracy,
the whole thing to read.

1390
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.110
People who could read and he comes in there as the Pharaoh,
right?

1391
01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:50.800
A living God and says,
guess what?
This whole religion that we,
we've,

1392
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:54.070
we've bazillions of years.
There's only one God.

1393
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:57.550
I've changed it and it's the sun and this thing that happened.

1394
01:15:57.551 --> 01:15:59.950
They think he may have been assassinated after he dies,

1395
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.430
the priests get back into power and cross off all of the pictures of him and the

1396
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:07.470
hieroglyphics with his name and his face is scratched out a lot of them.
And,
and,

1397
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.680
and that's the kind of revolution that's bigger than any of the kind that Luther

1398
01:16:11.681 --> 01:16:13.930
did.
Because you're not just saying the government's wrong,

1399
01:16:13.931 --> 01:16:18.931
or the societies or you're saying reality as you have known it is a lie and

1400
01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:20.590
we're going to change it.

1401
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:24.160
And we in the modern world have never lived through anything like that.
I mean,

1402
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:26.200
that,
that is a questioning of,
I mean,

1403
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:28.510
we have things that you could say is a little bit like that,

1404
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:32.420
but because we don't believe in a single truth as a society.
Yeah.

1405
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.380
So you can't have somebody say that single truth that every one of you have

1406
01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:39.610
taken for granted is wrong.
I mean,
that's,
that's a wicked hundred and 80 degree,

1407
01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.240
you know,
shift in perceptions and you have to know something's gonna go wrong.

1408
01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.030
And that is that.

1409
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:48.910
It's also really important that everybody doesn't agree on things.
That's a very,

1410
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.790
very modern concept.

1411
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.820
The only way infrastructure is going to get laid out and fucking pipes for facet

1412
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:58.930
and that connections are going to be put in place.

1413
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:02.070
Is there someone other than you are,
I are doing it but you need,
you know,

1414
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:05.400
you know you need someone who can figure that out.
You need someone who,
who,

1415
01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:08.440
you know,
like certain bands and people don't like other bands.

1416
01:17:08.441 --> 01:17:10.040
You don't need that.
And the reason you

1417
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.040
<v 4>know that is we've had two very large totalitarian regimes in your parents'</v>

1418
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.770
lifetime or your grandparents.

1419
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.260
I'm that that dictated that there was only going to be one mode of thought and

1420
01:17:22.261 --> 01:17:25.670
one reality.
And if you thought different,
they might kill you.

1421
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:30.050
Nazi Germany,
the Soviet Union would,
communes were Red China to where,

1422
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.550
where there was a very narrow band of,
of free thought you could have.

1423
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:38.210
And the attempt was to get everybody on the same page.
And you think,

1424
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.850
because hit and I think probably misquoting Hitler here,

1425
01:17:40.851 --> 01:17:45.851
that the idea was to have one brain running the society instead of all these

1426
01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:46.994
brains.

1427
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.530
And if you had an entire people who could then be the muscle force for one will

1428
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.480
then you we're going to be more efficient.

1429
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:54.710
And he thought Hitler thought he would,

1430
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:57.590
they were much more efficient than we were because you have one guy saying,
okay,

1431
01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:00.590
we're going to all do this and then everybody does it as opposed to us.

1432
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.720
We're all this chaotic stuff and you know,

1433
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:06.320
doing everybody moving in their own direction and in the theory of capitalism,

1434
01:18:06.321 --> 01:18:09.110
that's a good thing.
But in all these totalitarian regimes,

1435
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.750
that is a lot of wasted energy and a lot of wasted effort.

1436
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:12.880
And who made you qualified?
It

1437
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:14.340
<v 0>decided that you wanted to do,
yeah,</v>

1438
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:17.860
when I was saying by saying the only way to have what I mean is the only way to

1439
01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:21.190
have a society that works well then you have a bunch of things happening is you

1440
01:18:21.191 --> 01:18:22.240
have to have disagreements.

1441
01:18:22.241 --> 01:18:26.310
You have to have a few on variety of people want it to see if you want Freeman.

1442
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.200
But there,
there should be freedom.
I mean obviously right?

1443
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:31.480
Everybody sort of tee shirt that says that.

1444
01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.160
I think one of the problems that we have really first and foremost is that no

1445
01:18:36.161 --> 01:18:39.610
one is qualified to be president.
The idea of being a president is a joke.

1446
01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:42.790
The idea of being a mayor is a joke.
The idea of being a governor as a joke,

1447
01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:46.780
it's too big.
It's too big a task for any one person.

1448
01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.860
So to have one person just be a figurehead,
one person to be a spokesperson,

1449
01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.040
that's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be that anymore.
So one person,

1450
01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:57.520
the one mind the internet.
Okay,
I'm just going to say what's the alternative?

1451
01:18:57.521 --> 01:19:01.210
The Internet.
The Internet's the alternative and then,
okay,
well,
okay,

1452
01:19:01.211 --> 01:19:04.030
well what about all these crazy people?
What about all this fucking nonsense?

1453
01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.830
What all these nuts that posted in the internet.

1454
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:09.760
Then we have to deal with the real issue that humanity faces.

1455
01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.200
The infrastructure of humanity itself is incredibly flawed because we ignore a

1456
01:19:14.201 --> 01:19:18.040
bunch of crazy people.
We ignore impoverished people.

1457
01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:21.370
We ignore the weakest link in our community and we're pretending it's not our

1458
01:19:21.371 --> 01:19:24.640
community.
If we become a global community,
we are going to have to address that.

1459
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:25.930
You're going to have to address who,

1460
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.280
what shitty human beings are making shitty human beings to grow up to become

1461
01:19:30.281 --> 01:19:31.330
youtube posters.

1462
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.130
Those Youtube commentors crazy assholes and help this girl to die because she

1463
01:19:36.131 --> 01:19:37.220
sings a song.
You've

1464
01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.560
<v 4>got me thinking about something that there's,</v>

1465
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.520
there's two basic philosophies you could have in our kind of political system.

1466
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.270
One is the superior human being,
in other words,

1467
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:49.460
a society of 300 million people.

1468
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:53.600
In the same way you would produce some great Olympic athletes who were superior

1469
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:58.010
at this or that physically you will produce some people who are superior in

1470
01:19:58.011 --> 01:20:00.560
terms of governing,
in terms of education,
whatever it is,

1471
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:04.340
so that they can be our representative and do a better job than we could do

1472
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.980
ourselves.
Well,
you could go back to a concept that is from ancient Greece,

1473
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.680
<v 3>although it didn't run like this in ancient Greece and say that the Internet can</v>

1474
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:13.080
be the facilitator for this and say,

1475
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:17.400
let's vote on every individual decision.

1476
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:19.920
Forget senators for get congressmen.
We have an internet.

1477
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:24.090
It can be like American idol.
You could say,
hey,
should we go invade Afghanistan?

1478
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:26.760
Get on your Internet right now and vote and we'll tell you what the tallies are

1479
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:27.001
later.

1480
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:29.520
Although it might be like that show that you said you were on that one time

1481
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:33.390
where the votes didn't really count,
but a might be a great way to say,
hey,

1482
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:38.340
everybody wanted to invade Afghanistan 99.9% wow.
Yeah,
but you know what I mean?

1483
01:20:38.341 --> 01:20:42.060
Is it that the two philosophies are really at polar opposites?

1484
01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:46.440
One is that would you actually trust the United States as you know it today to

1485
01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:49.920
make those decisions any better than they're made now or or would you say,

1486
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:53.700
listen that and and fill in the blank.
X,
we might pick different people,

1487
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:57.150
but I would let that guy be president because he do a better job than the

1488
01:20:57.151 --> 01:21:00.120
current crop of people.
If I could appoint him,
no,
it wouldn't be for me.

1489
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.140
It wouldn't even be a politician.
I'd find some guys,

1490
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:06.540
you can't have the system we have.
It doesn't work.
This is my point.

1491
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.260
If you want to try to like keep patching it up and keep pretending that there's

1492
01:21:10.261 --> 01:21:11.610
any logical reason why.

1493
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:14.640
If you started from scratch today and we're trying to design a political

1494
01:21:14.641 --> 01:21:18.480
infrastructure,
the ability to exchange information that we enjoy today,

1495
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.720
you would never have one person.
I agree with that.
Well,
I don't know about that,

1496
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:24.000
but I would definitely,
I think it's,

1497
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.490
I think it's a ridiculous position first of all,

1498
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.230
and I think the idea of people who are wise and older and maybe perhaps

1499
01:21:31.231 --> 01:21:35.640
information,
having information information,
but without any ulterior motive,

1500
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:40.910
like people that really genuinely want their community to grow to be a safer

1501
01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:42.870
place.
People who want to figure it out,

1502
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:45.090
how to relate the people who don't want to be a police officer.

1503
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.000
Do you want to be president?
Absolutely not.
Okay.
You have a job.
You know,

1504
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:51.930
here's the thing you are,
if you're what they did.
See the thing is president,

1505
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:54.570
it's no one is qualified with it shouldn't be a job.

1506
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.300
Let's talk about decentralization.

1507
01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.190
The problem might be that we have a government built for 13 states and small

1508
01:22:02.191 --> 01:22:06.300
rural in a much shorter population.
What if we said,
listen,
that's the problem.

1509
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:09.720
And I talked to James Burke of connections and he said that the Internet is

1510
01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:13.410
going to make,
you know,
in the old days,
um,
it's almost like building monopolies.

1511
01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:16.560
We talked about entertainment companies conglomerating because they needed to,

1512
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.950
in the old days,
you needed to,
it made you a stronger,
safer country.

1513
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:22.140
But now with the Internet and the ideas and the,

1514
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:26.340
maybe decentralization becomes the answer to some of,
I mean,
you can,

1515
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:30.570
there's also the,
the idea that people were trying to organize to avoid tyranny.

1516
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.500
The reason why a state will pass a law that the federal government doesn't agree

1517
01:22:34.501 --> 01:22:37.350
with this because the state disagrees with how the federal government is

1518
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.320
dictating their freedoms,
right?
So those,

1519
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:44.130
like people like in Colorado that vote on matters,
marijuana being legal,

1520
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:47.580
they band together and say,
hey man,
look,
we're,
this is our land.

1521
01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:50.730
This is where we live.
And we think it's cool to do here.
If you,

1522
01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:52.110
if there was a bigger argument,

1523
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.350
if you guys want to come in and prove to us that you could sell oxycontin's

1524
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.040
every fucking cvs,
but this shit is illegal,
you're going to have to make,

1525
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:01.710
you're going to have to make a point because we haven't,
we now have a state law.

1526
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:05.470
This is an age old question that remember that before we had the government,

1527
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:06.100
we had,
we had

1528
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.970
<v 2>something under the articles of confederation and the articles of confederation,</v>

1529
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:10.930
the earlier system.

1530
01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:14.500
The argument against it was that the federal government didn't have enough power

1531
01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.570
and that the states could get away with too much,

1532
01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:19.900
including things like maybe a Connecticut should be able to print their own

1533
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:23.620
money and so you,
you get to this thing where we're where that wasn't working.

1534
01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:27.610
So they went the other direction and then there was a time Joe,

1535
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.630
where we weren't called the unit when when people would say the United States of

1536
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.210
America,
now they say the United States of America is doing something.

1537
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.200
It was considered to be such an agreement between a bunch of states then until

1538
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:38.920
about,

1539
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.920
I want to say 1,918 90 they would say the United States of America are doing

1540
01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:47.740
something.
In other words,
talk about the states as though they really,

1541
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:48.700
it's not a country,

1542
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:52.990
it's a confederation of states that agree to be together because it's working

1543
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:53.620
for them.

1544
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.230
The civil war screwed that whole thing up and that's when you always get these

1545
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:59.710
guys like rand Paul always has like five guys working form of they,

1546
01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.410
I still have the confederacy if they want to.

1547
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.750
He's got some secret white people working for him.
Huh.

1548
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:05.800
You know what's scary though?

1549
01:24:05.801 --> 01:24:09.460
What's scary though is that if you're like me and I don't agree with any of

1550
01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:12.430
those kinds of things,
I understand their point of what they're saying though,

1551
01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:13.920
which is that the,
the,

1552
01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:17.500
the racism and the slavery and the Jim Crow laws totally screwed up.

1553
01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:20.770
States' rights because it's like a child who you say you can stay out as late as

1554
01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:21.730
you want cause I trust you.

1555
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.670
And then they stay out until five in the morning and they come home all drunk

1556
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:27.420
and you go,
that's it for you.
You're not going to be staying out.
I do.

1557
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:30.730
And that's what the stage did.
They abuse the states' rights things and,

1558
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.880
and the federal government now gets to run while where you could go,
God,

1559
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:36.610
maybe we,
maybe we could trust the states to be okay again.

1560
01:24:36.611 --> 01:24:40.030
But what you'll have happened is the states that are like us,

1561
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:43.570
we'll totally use their things responsibly in the states we don't like.
We'll be,

1562
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:46.690
you know,
no voting rights and they'll be doing all the geo,

1563
01:24:46.691 --> 01:24:50.620
we're putting people to death for marijuana use in South Carolina because that's

1564
01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:54.220
the way we like it in rock and Dana.
So you wonder if it would work,

1565
01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:58.180
but at the same time you go a little decentralizations starting to sound kind of

1566
01:24:58.181 --> 01:25:00.160
good.
Well,
if only for the complexity reasons.

1567
01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.690
<v 0>Yeah,
very good point.
And what I,
what I meant by,</v>

1568
01:25:02.691 --> 01:25:05.150
it's good to have states to fight against tyranny.
Ultimately,

1569
01:25:05.151 --> 01:25:07.820
it'd be really nice if there was no tyranny and it was really nice.

1570
01:25:07.821 --> 01:25:08.900
It wouldn't be no tyranny.

1571
01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:11.810
Then we should really stop looking at anything regionally.

1572
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:16.410
And that extends to states,
extends to countries,
and extends to the nation.

1573
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.150
<v 2>He's,
why do you even have to have,
because you may have people that are like you,</v>

1574
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:23.630
500 of them are in Tennessee.
Why should Tennessee be Tennessee?

1575
01:25:23.631 --> 01:25:26.990
Why can't it be the Joe Rogan nation,
which includes 500 people?

1576
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:28.240
<v 0>See,
that's the real problem.</v>

1577
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:30.280
You name it after a dude and he's going to fuck everybody.

1578
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:32.560
And then when you're gone,
it's the Brian Redmond nation,

1579
01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:35.300
and it might be run totally differently.
Everybody.
That's right.

1580
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:39.500
It's not a good idea.
The son of God and everybody's wife and his,
you can't eat,

1581
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.050
sign American rock that rock that we can't have that kind of power and people

1582
01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:44.980
feel,
do they fuck it up?

1583
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.740
<v 2>But the problem is that the decisions still have to be made.</v>

1584
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:49.280
So someone's got to have the voting

1585
01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.760
<v 0>American article.
But if you were going to,
if you were going to,
and we'll,</v>

1586
01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:55.400
after the swear folks wouldn't get into history,
there will be no history.

1587
01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.960
If you were going to design a new civilization,

1588
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:04.220
if you could like stop everything that we're doing and look at it in terms of,

1589
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:06.830
okay,
here's the resources,
here's the humans that need to be fed.

1590
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.210
Here's the things that need to get done to make our life a better place.
Um,

1591
01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:13.940
what's our conflicts?
You would find out the conflicts.

1592
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:16.310
So it's almost the scene conflicts that have always existed.

1593
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:17.960
Control over resources.

1594
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:22.280
If one person has an oil well that punts persons just sucking billions of

1595
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.040
dollars out of the ground.
And then there's the hippies,
they're like,
man,

1596
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.770
who says that is his man that oils the earth?

1597
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.450
Why should you be able to profit off that?

1598
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.950
And then the Breitling people would say,
well,

1599
01:26:30.951 --> 01:26:33.140
he's the one who built the infrastructure.
We built the machines.

1600
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:34.610
He designed to be a fucking dirty hippie.

1601
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:37.910
Of course he gets deal all the oil and it gets to be a weird situation where you

1602
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:42.720
go,
okay,
how do you manage those conflicts?
Everything else is bullshit.
Lobbyists.

1603
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.070
<v 4>Hello Shit.
Get the,
now there's,
there's two ways you look at it.</v>

1604
01:26:45.071 --> 01:26:48.430
One is the ways they'd done in the past,
which we talked about direct democracy,

1605
01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.270
you know,
you could do with it,

1606
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.610
let's vote on who gets to own the oil well or whatever.

1607
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.770
Then there's representative governments where you say,

1608
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:57.540
Joe Schmo can be my guy and be be the one who votes.
Uh,

1609
01:26:57.730 --> 01:27:00.550
for me ether as I tell him too,

1610
01:27:00.551 --> 01:27:03.820
which some people believe our government's supposed to do or because I trust his

1611
01:27:03.821 --> 01:27:06.540
intellect and his judgment and so he'll go do that.
Um,

1612
01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.400
or some idea we haven't invented yet,

1613
01:27:09.401 --> 01:27:11.200
and I keep trying to tell people this all the time,

1614
01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:14.860
the attitude they have is that every kind of government that's ever going to be

1615
01:27:14.861 --> 01:27:18.100
invented has been invented.
And our choices are the ones we've had.

1616
01:27:18.101 --> 01:27:21.820
I'm truly have the belief system that they are going to be kinds of governments

1617
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.350
we haven't thought of yet.

1618
01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.410
And the Internet might be a perfect example of something that can facilitate

1619
01:27:26.411 --> 01:27:29.530
that.
I don't know what they would be and they might be an evolution of something

1620
01:27:29.531 --> 01:27:32.500
we've already seen or they might be something totally wicked and weird,

1621
01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:33.670
but I think that that might happen.

1622
01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.310
<v 0>I think it already is an ally.</v>

1623
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:38.790
Maybe the Internet is judging their passing judgment.

1624
01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:42.990
And a sentence on George Zimmerman and a lot of ways this Trayvon Martin thing,

1625
01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:43.890
and I don't mean everybody,

1626
01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:46.890
but there's a percentage of people that have decided that that guy murdered that

1627
01:27:46.891 --> 01:27:51.510
kid and he got away with it and they're writing articles and making videos and

1628
01:27:51.511 --> 01:27:56.130
attacking,
attacking,
attacking all day.
And that is in a large sense a punishment.

1629
01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:59.820
And in a huge sense,
it's not even being thought of.
Cause everybody thinks,

1630
01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:03.060
well the guys out there wandering free the fuck he is.

1631
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:05.490
Could you imagine how terrifying it is?

1632
01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.940
And I'm in no way supporting this man and no way I do.
You know,
I'm,
I'm,

1633
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.670
I'm not casting any judgment.

1634
01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.650
I'm saying imagine how much hate that guy feels everywhere he goes.

1635
01:28:16.651 --> 01:28:18.360
Every time he sees a black face,

1636
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:22.470
he knows it's very likely that that person is very mad at him.

1637
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.470
Or might even want to assault him or even possibly kill him.

1638
01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:30.510
There's some people out there that hate that guy and that's all based on the

1639
01:28:30.511 --> 01:28:32.190
judgment of the Internet.

1640
01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.100
That's all based on the judgment of the people that have access to the

1641
01:28:35.101 --> 01:28:38.730
information.
They've collectively agreed that they hate that guy.

1642
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:39.623
There's a judgment,

1643
01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.690
<v 4>but I'm not comparing that.
You had to,
all these disclaimers we have to have,</v>

1644
01:28:42.691 --> 01:28:43.690
I'm not comparing this case.

1645
01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:48.600
The Oj Simpson thing seems very similar to me then that was basically

1646
01:28:48.601 --> 01:28:53.340
pre-internet what it is,
but it was just distributed differently,

1647
01:28:53.341 --> 01:28:56.520
but it was just as effective in terms of the public consciousness absorbing it.

1648
01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.520
<v 0>Yeah,
I think so.
But now I think,</v>

1649
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.250
I think he gets

1650
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:06.230
<v 3>it like more readily.
Here's the opinions directly from,</v>

1651
01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.520
you want to have him run into a disaster.

1652
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:13.140
Go Jay could put blinders on and go to a restaurant and pretend I was acquitted.

1653
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:14.960
I'm looking for the killer.
You know,
he could,

1654
01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.900
or he could lie to himself about how many people wanted,
you know,

1655
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.120
something bad to happen to him.

1656
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.950
We can't really lie to yourself when you read the comment.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1657
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:26.550
And even though that sucks,
it's good.
I Hate Zimmerman,

1658
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:30.090
Rogan and car and I hate them all people hate.

1659
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.810
There's a lot of people that hate and that's something that we're going to have

1660
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:37.290
to address,
uh,
just as,
as a,
as if you,

1661
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:41.690
if the human organism really is a super organism,
the human race,
you're,

1662
01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.610
it's just like a person who has a cavity that's trying to ignoring it.

1663
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.980
If you've got a bunch of crazy people in this world,

1664
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.980
you've got a bunch of mindless people that are doing horrible crimes.

1665
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.500
You have to address that somehow or another.

1666
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:57.501
Collectively we have to stop trying to get a Tesla s and address underlying

1667
01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.400
behaviors.
The line,

1668
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:02.820
this is the Gi Joe Rogan Dan Carlin line where I don't follow you,

1669
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:05.130
but you weren't you,
you were in my mom's camp though.

1670
01:30:05.131 --> 01:30:06.120
So you've got some good company,

1671
01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:10.700
but it's just got told is data we need to tell me.

1672
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.930
I get told,

1673
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:16.930
he just got put on this camp that says we humans must evolve past all this

1674
01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:20.670
stuff.
And then there's the camp that says no,

1675
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:25.671
what you see now and what you have seen since the beginning is what we are.

1676
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:30.720
And you have to build systems with an understanding that this is what we are.

1677
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:32.340
And this is the old history thing.

1678
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:35.760
The only reason you learn from history is because the one thing that's not

1679
01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:40.760
changing in those history books is [inaudible] else changes.

1680
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:45.360
But you know those guys in the Roman play,
that's the,
the,
there were togas on,

1681
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:48.820
but they were us.
So like when you read about the stories of Yon Van Bliden nor,

1682
01:30:48.821 --> 01:30:52.070
and listen to you talking about it actually,
yeah,
I go,
that's David.
Correct.

1683
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.520
That's right.
The same guy.

1684
01:30:53.521 --> 01:30:58.320
And so my point is that I'm not willing to try to build a society based on the,

1685
01:30:58.321 --> 01:31:02.160
okay,
as long as we evolve,
this will work.
Because I don't think that's happening.

1686
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.880
I see your pessimism and I totally understand.
I live on the pessimism.

1687
01:31:05.881 --> 01:31:06.570
Just so you know,

1688
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:11.570
I think if you look at human beings from the time of neanderthal wars with the

1689
01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:13.320
fucking vikings and the,
you know,

1690
01:31:13.321 --> 01:31:16.680
the Crispian Shaw showing up and sing a pile of bones,

1691
01:31:16.681 --> 01:31:19.200
it looks like a snow capped mountain in the distance.

1692
01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:20.670
Cause the Mongols got there first.

1693
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:23.720
That's where they had abandoned roads because there was so many decaying bodies

1694
01:31:23.721 --> 01:31:28.050
and fat who was blocking the road yet walking the roads and everyone was dying

1695
01:31:28.051 --> 01:31:32.780
of diseases.
I mean that,
that all happened.
Just a few.
Let me,

1696
01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:37.080
it was a 900 years ago and let me just tell you haven't heard the Austin Front

1697
01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:40.350
podcast we did yet.
No,
I haven't heard it yet.
I'll tell you the way it starts.

1698
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:43.800
The Oss Front podcast that we did,
we just on the war in the eastern front,

1699
01:31:43.801 --> 01:31:45.210
which not enough,
have a load it up.

1700
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:47.490
Most of the people in the West don't know about this.

1701
01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:49.530
We learned about d day and all these things we did,

1702
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:51.690
but we were on the periphery of that war.

1703
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:55.890
That war really happened between the Germans and the Soviet Union in the east.

1704
01:31:56.250 --> 01:32:00.460
And there's a book called aftermath by Donovan,
which is a fascinating

1705
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:04.450
<v 4>book where he goes to these battlefields today and sees what's there.</v>

1706
01:32:04.451 --> 01:32:08.800
It's like a Joe Rogan questions,
everything.
And he goes to this woman,
he goes,
it,

1707
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:13.230
it's,
it's not as good as that obviously,
but he goes to,
he goes to the,

1708
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:17.100
goes to this,
uh,
he goes to this,
this field in the middle of the steps.

1709
01:32:17.101 --> 01:32:20.320
So it's where the Mongols worse,
it's this wide open expanse with no hills,

1710
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:21.430
no mountains and everything.
And A,

1711
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.890
and a Russian guide takes him here and it's covered in snow.

1712
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:27.760
And the Russian guide tells him to put his eye down on the ground.

1713
01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:31.030
So he's viewing it at eye level and he says,
as soon as I do,

1714
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:33.640
and as soon as my eyes adjust to the sun and the snow,

1715
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.050
I see things sticking out of the ground all the way miles,

1716
01:32:38.051 --> 01:32:39.250
often into the horizon.

1717
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:44.490
And then he realizes their bone all as far as the eye can see.

1718
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:48.970
And then he goes and they start walking in their bones with boots on them and

1719
01:32:48.971 --> 01:32:52.240
belts and everything.
And it's because so many people,

1720
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.340
this is where Stalin Grad was and the last stand of it and it,

1721
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:58.390
it's miles and miles and the Sobey,
it's just in bury anything.

1722
01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:02.680
They just coordinate the whole area off after the war and let everything stay

1723
01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:06.910
where it was.
And since he wrote that book and the Soviet Union has fallen,

1724
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:11.770
the treasure hunters have been going through these areas because they can sell

1725
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.210
daggers and boots and metals and all these things they find and they have been,

1726
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:19.150
you can go online and see where they've picked these places clean.

1727
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:23.980
But I mean it's unbelievable.
And this is now,
I mean this is,

1728
01:33:23.981 --> 01:33:27.120
they're there and the farmers shit still there.
Yeah.

1729
01:33:27.121 --> 01:33:28.750
And the farmers and there's no pain.

1730
01:33:28.751 --> 01:33:31.090
There's no pictures of Soviet Union wouldn't let them take pictures.

1731
01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:33.230
So there are how many miles,
oh for,

1732
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:36.280
and not just here you go to this one valley and it's all there and then you

1733
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:37.510
drive to another valley.

1734
01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:40.270
And there's another one because of what they would do is they would just Google

1735
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:43.240
maps.
No,
I don't.
Good question.
But what they will do is they will,

1736
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:47.170
they would close these rings,
right?
They would surround the look for it.

1737
01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:51.880
If he was gone,
well call us Soviet bone fields,
Soviet bone fields.

1738
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:54.700
What happens is as their,
as their surrounding these Germans,

1739
01:33:54.701 --> 01:33:59.530
they're closing the ring tighter and tighter and then they use artillery and

1740
01:33:59.531 --> 01:34:02.740
just destroy these pack Germans who are packed in,
you know,

1741
01:34:02.741 --> 01:34:06.400
a pocket of maybe 15 miles by five miles.
And they just end.

1742
01:34:06.401 --> 01:34:09.730
The Soviet is just left him there and they left their own troops there.

1743
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:14.320
And so when you,
when you hear this story of the oss front,
this is recent.

1744
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.211
And those people did,

1745
01:34:15.211 --> 01:34:19.990
the farmers used to have to take the tractors and pile up the bones in the

1746
01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:24.130
corner of their farms so they could plow the fields.
You know.
So this is,

1747
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:29.710
and you go to France,
what time period is this?
What you in 1940540440 three.

1748
01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:32.710
And if you go to France today,
this is also in Webster's book,

1749
01:34:32.711 --> 01:34:35.600
which is a fabulous book.
Aftermath.
You should go get it.
Um,

1750
01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:39.550
he talks about the first world war where you go to France today and they had

1751
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:44.551
giant parts of the most fertile parts of France that are still cordoned off.

1752
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:50.200
You can't go near because there's 30,000 or something,
artillery shells,

1753
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:51.580
you know,
per square,

1754
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:56.350
you 20 feet or something that come to the surface because the weather brings

1755
01:34:56.351 --> 01:35:00.410
them up.
Some of them have poison gas in them.
They're all rusty and d stabilize.

1756
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.560
And the French have squads of people who collect these as best as they can all

1757
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:07.760
the time.
And then like every month,

1758
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:12.320
take them off the coast at low tide and blow 'em up and they lose like 50 or a

1759
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:17.210
hundred of these guys every year who do nothing but dig up this artillery that's

1760
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:21.710
made huge swats of friends in 1914 to 1918 uninhabitable.

1761
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.030
And it's still there.

1762
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.480
And so when you talk about how long ago some of this stuff happened,

1763
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:29.030
a lot of this stuff didn't even happen that long ago,

1764
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:30.680
but people don't even know what's out there.

1765
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:35.870
So your thoughts on seeing horrific things that have happened like that are that

1766
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:39.110
you look,
it's just a matter of the shit hitting the fan here.

1767
01:35:39.111 --> 01:35:40.310
Something going wrong.

1768
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.120
US getting into some sort of global conflict that's happening at your doorstep

1769
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:46.520
and we would revert right back to,
here's my theory.

1770
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.070
I almost feel like pressure builds up.
Like you know,

1771
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:52.220
you know in California we used to call it earthquake weather,
right?

1772
01:35:52.221 --> 01:35:53.930
You get this thing where you just felt like,
okay,

1773
01:35:53.931 --> 01:35:57.620
there hasn't been an earthquake and a long time you can almost feel the ground

1774
01:35:57.621 --> 01:35:58.880
getting ready and like it just,

1775
01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:01.100
something's got a break and the first world war was that way.

1776
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:03.860
Everybody kind of saw it and something's going to happen,
something getting boom,

1777
01:36:03.861 --> 01:36:07.490
it happens.
I think that's what happens.
I think.
I think the tensions build up.

1778
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.310
Things get frayed,
the systems begin to degenerate.

1779
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:13.970
People start getting rouse d and then something happens and everybody goes

1780
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:17.690
Berserk for awhile.
And in Europe used to happen like every hundred years.

1781
01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:19.610
You know,
after they beat the hell out of Napoleon,

1782
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.030
they sign this congress of Vienna and they get this great system going.

1783
01:36:23.031 --> 01:36:26.510
The system goes for 100 years until it phrase,
and then once it phrase it,

1784
01:36:26.511 --> 01:36:28.550
I'll explodes again and an even bigger war.

1785
01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:31.370
And then the first world war leads to the Second World War and it's just the

1786
01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:35.240
tension and the stress get to be such a degree that things just collapsed and

1787
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:39.350
explode.
But when you have an earthquake,
it takes the tension away for a while.

1788
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:43.360
It's like,
it's like whatever the seismic pressure that was building up,
you know,

1789
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:44.890
is deep pressurized for awhile.

1790
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.960
Everybody can exhale and then it slowly starts ratcheting up again.

1791
01:36:50.241 --> 01:36:51.410
I think that that's what happens.

1792
01:36:51.411 --> 01:36:53.300
We hit these periods where earthquakes just happened.

1793
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.920
Do you think that this is a,

1794
01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:59.330
that society today is a safer place though than in the 1940s and certainly then

1795
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:03.710
the 1200
I don't know.
You don't mean literally,

1796
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:05.030
I don't want to pretend that I do.
I,

1797
01:37:05.031 --> 01:37:09.740
I think that perhaps we're in one of those period,
there's an argument about,

1798
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:12.380
you know,
cause you know I'm an anti global,

1799
01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:15.830
I don't think the United States should be in 147 countries.
I'm against all that.

1800
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:19.340
But the people that argue with me about that,
so to give fair due to them,

1801
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.690
we'll say that the reason we don't have that kind of stuff happening is because

1802
01:37:23.691 --> 01:37:26.030
in the periods of history where you've had great powers,

1803
01:37:26.031 --> 01:37:28.940
it was Great Britain before us.
There have been other powers before that,

1804
01:37:28.941 --> 01:37:30.620
the Roman Empire,
whatever you want to say,

1805
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:35.540
that they keep the lid on these things that they provide the stability that when

1806
01:37:35.541 --> 01:37:38.540
they're not there or when they choose to not do their job,

1807
01:37:38.541 --> 01:37:41.450
sometimes everything finally goes to heck in a hand basket.

1808
01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:43.310
So you're going to have these earthquake sometimes,

1809
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.610
but if you have an overarching power that can sort of nip the earthquakes in the

1810
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.800
bud,
it doesn't get as bad.
I don't know.

1811
01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:50.480
But that's what they always argue with me against.

1812
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.680
I don't know that you can prevent them because I don't exactly know what causes

1813
01:37:54.681 --> 01:37:57.170
them.
I think it's a think.
It's just human nature.
Yes,

1814
01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:58.500
and that's where we get about earlier.

1815
01:37:58.501 --> 01:38:00.660
I don't think you can change human nature or the that you can.

1816
01:38:00.661 --> 01:38:03.780
You can change your own nature if you know what,
here's a here.
Okay.

1817
01:38:03.781 --> 01:38:06.300
If I want to think like Joe Rogan,
if I want it or my mom,

1818
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:10.860
if I wanted to talk about it,
evolving it both.
Oh my mom,

1819
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:12.600
you've got to meet my mom.
She's a crazy woman.

1820
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.310
If you want to talk about evolving past this,

1821
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.500
then maybe you could talk about DNA changing and some of the scientists who are

1822
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:22.980
taught.

1823
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.010
It's funny because you get right back to Nazi eugenics when you get to this,

1824
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:28.140
but there is,
there's an opposite thought.
Well,

1825
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:31.140
instead of creating the master race in terms of the strongest and the biggest

1826
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:36.141
and then maybe creating a master race means getting rid of those human qualities

1827
01:38:36.541 --> 01:38:40.230
that if we had a choice,
people wouldn't have.
You've talked about madness.
Well,

1828
01:38:40.231 --> 01:38:45.231
what if some madness is connected to things in the DNA string or violence or you

1829
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:48.870
know,
whatever you want to say.
These people that are,
you know what?

1830
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:51.600
If you're born to be a rapist and you could get rid of that from somebody

1831
01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:55.180
<v 0>DNA,
someone just got a new test to Dan Carlin.</v>

1832
01:38:57.030 --> 01:39:01.000
You see,
my point is that if you want to talk about changing human nature,

1833
01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:05.650
it might have to be at the DNA level as opposed to hoping that people will just,

1834
01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.590
the reason why I disagree with that,
the reason why I disagree with that.

1835
01:39:08.591 --> 01:39:11.110
As you think it's vitamin I,
the people have changed.

1836
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.620
I know that some human beings have evolved and what are some who

1837
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:19.900
have societies but cannot?

1838
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.680
What happens to one person happened to tu cannot happen to a group,

1839
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:25.210
cannot have happened to our society.

1840
01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.350
I think the real issue is we're not making the best use of the information that

1841
01:39:29.351 --> 01:39:30.250
we've been provided.

1842
01:39:30.251 --> 01:39:35.240
We have unlimited access to all the answers as far as human behavior.

1843
01:39:35.241 --> 01:39:36.210
Good enough arguments.

1844
01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:39.820
Some of these Weirdos could be talked out of their weird and management and I

1845
01:39:39.821 --> 01:39:44.821
think there's a management of your own personal energy to 20 yoga classes and

1846
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.960
that's a show.
Joe Kahn Karate.
It should be a part of your life I think.

1847
01:39:49.961 --> 01:39:54.550
I mean for,
I've always said that for boys,
I think that's something difficult.

1848
01:39:54.551 --> 01:39:58.960
Whether it's rock climbing or whether it's Jujitsu or whether it's a sport or a

1849
01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:00.670
a musical pursuit.

1850
01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.880
Something difficult is important because you have this overwhelming desire to

1851
01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:10.110
spread your seed,
not just sexually.
It's also spread.
Your ideas

1852
01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:15.520
should the overarching state mandate that it has now that doesn't ever work.

1853
01:40:15.521 --> 01:40:17.530
I think this should just be positive examples around.

1854
01:40:17.531 --> 01:40:21.720
I think the idea of government to me is not as effective in cleaning up the

1855
01:40:21.721 --> 01:40:24.580
neighborhood as a really well funded a little hippie side.

1856
01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:28.210
I'm telling you I'm a hybrid.
Yeah.
They got a lot of Hippie in me.

1857
01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.410
The hippie Jujitsu.
I'm the,
I'm the bridge.
Yeah.
Okay,
well I see it.

1858
01:40:32.411 --> 01:40:33.250
That's the hippies in the right.

1859
01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:35.950
<v 4>My mother thinks bad earthquakes are going to happen and we're going to be</v>

1860
01:40:35.951 --> 01:40:38.530
forced to pull together afterwards and that,
that will bring some,

1861
01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:42.350
<v 0>a lot of people believe that that could happen.
And I remember after nine 11,
uh,</v>

1862
01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:46.120
that big historical moment where people were really fucking Nice in New York.

1863
01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:49.150
It was one of the weirdest things ever.
I remember going back to New York,

1864
01:40:49.151 --> 01:40:52.450
we were there in 2000 and just maybe,

1865
01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.230
maybe of 2001 just a few months after nine 11.

1866
01:40:56.231 --> 01:41:00.220
And people were nicer than I can ever remember.
Nicer,
more engaged,

1867
01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:04.330
more tuned into each other,
more like more,
more appreciative of each other.

1868
01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:08.650
It was a completely different vibe.
So it lasted for a couple of years.

1869
01:41:08.651 --> 01:41:11.290
Then people turned conti again,
but it's like,

1870
01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:14.490
so they reverted back to human nature.
I had a kickboxing instructor.

1871
01:41:14.491 --> 01:41:17.250
His name is Shuki.
It's Sheekey's from Israel.
Cool motherfucker.

1872
01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.690
I think he's in back in Israel now.
Uh,
but he was a,
he,

1873
01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.910
he trained in Holland and lived in Israel and you know,

1874
01:41:24.911 --> 01:41:27.700
he lived in a fucking war zone man.
And this guy,

1875
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:31.570
I went over his house for dinner once,
him and his wife,
they start dancing,

1876
01:41:31.571 --> 01:41:33.940
they bring out the Bongos,
their kids are dancing.

1877
01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:36.940
And I mean he's just like so festive.
You know,

1878
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:38.740
they're having a couple of cocktails and not even drunk.

1879
01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:41.860
They're just like having a good time.
And so I said to him,
I said,
well,

1880
01:41:41.861 --> 01:41:46.861
I go with so many Israelis I meet are like look like so happy and fun loving and

1881
01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:51.250
like he goes because over there he goes,
you could just fucking die.
He goes,

1882
01:41:51.251 --> 01:41:54.100
you could just fucking die.
People die all the time.
So when you're alive,
party,

1883
01:41:54.101 --> 01:41:56.260
party,
party.
And that was his attitude.

1884
01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:58.810
It was like I had friends like that growing up and they weren't,
they've

1885
01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:05.650
done a universal response for that,
those types of situations.

1886
01:42:05.651 --> 01:42:09.340
But I think one of the possibilities is that you can appreciate life when it

1887
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:12.730
becomes fleeting.
I think the problem with your philosophy,
and I'm not,

1888
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:16.540
I'm not denigrating it here,
is I absolutely believe you are right.

1889
01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:17.770
And I think we all,

1890
01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:22.300
I mean if you had grabbed me at 18 and compared the 18 year old meet and now you

1891
01:42:22.301 --> 01:42:25.420
would say,
wow,
that Dan Carlin guy has evolved and he's,
he's a,

1892
01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.850
he's a better person in so many ways then he was there,

1893
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:30.850
but I'm not human beings in the aggregate.

1894
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:35.080
And when you think about all those people out there and you say for things to

1895
01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:39.250
change,
we all have to get better or it won't work.
And I'm thinking to myself,

1896
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.870
okay,
I know which way I'm betting on this in Vegas and I go to Vegas and betting

1897
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:47.530
against the human race because I've seen it operate.
Yeah,
no,

1898
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:49.150
I see what you're saying.
You and I agree.

1899
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:53.410
Almost complete adoption and now you're back into Nazi land where they say the

1900
01:42:53.411 --> 01:42:56.350
only way to get complete adoption is to mandate complete adoption.

1901
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:57.520
If you give people freedom,

1902
01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.410
you're giving people the freedom to not evolve and there's a lot of people to

1903
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:03.130
choose to not evolve option.

1904
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:07.990
I absolutely think you're faster if you want to look at it in terms of,
you know,

1905
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:09.910
what you've seen so far,

1906
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.180
like these patterns repeating themselves over and over again from experience.

1907
01:43:13.181 --> 01:43:14.410
One would lead to believe,

1908
01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:19.440
but my answer to the big difference in the ingredient is the internet.

1909
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:22.050
And I think that didn't exist before.
And I think the,

1910
01:43:22.051 --> 01:43:25.930
the ability to exchange information the way we,
we enjoy it now,

1911
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:30.580
you can't factor in the influence that that's going to have on how people

1912
01:43:30.581 --> 01:43:32.530
understand the impact of decisions,

1913
01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.140
how people understand how behavior effects people,

1914
01:43:35.141 --> 01:43:38.790
help people understand the good in people as well.
Like the,

1915
01:43:38.791 --> 01:43:42.860
the ability to spread that and to realize that,
you know,
we think people are,

1916
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.280
a lot of people like to think that people in Iran are somehow or another our

1917
01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:45.880
enemy.

1918
01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.810
But then you watch all these videos of like kids and I ran and people talking

1919
01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:53.180
about America and talking about the problems with the world and go,

1920
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:55.850
oh wait a minute.
They're just like us.
They're just people.

1921
01:43:55.851 --> 01:43:59.150
They're just young people that have a different noise that they make for their

1922
01:43:59.151 --> 01:44:01.070
mouth that equals their words,

1923
01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.210
but other than that they're just people and that slowly but surely sinking in.

1924
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:09.320
So this idea of enemies and groups and states and territories and countries,

1925
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:12.200
it seems more and more ridiculous when the,

1926
01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:17.230
the global communications connection that we have really brings us all together

1927
01:44:19.281 --> 01:44:21.260
in a,
in a,
in a way that's never happened before,

1928
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:26.060
not just in countries but in states and communities and slowly but surely we're

1929
01:44:26.061 --> 01:44:30.380
going to realize that we are conflicts that we have are all because of cavities

1930
01:44:30.381 --> 01:44:31.214
that we're avoiding.

1931
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.610
It's all because of behavior that we're not checking at an early age.

1932
01:44:34.611 --> 01:44:39.611
It's all because there's zero emphasis put on managing psychology for children.

1933
01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.560
Z.
I've known nobody ever taught me in a think.

1934
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:46.100
Nobody ever taught me how to like think positive and move forward and how to

1935
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:48.350
treat people and be kind and that that it is actually

1936
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:52.040
<v 2>official places on the one part of that that I really can,
can,</v>

1937
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:55.520
can grab and hold that you said that I like about the children thing.

1938
01:44:55.521 --> 01:44:59.810
We did a show called suffer the children once where I examined something called

1939
01:44:59.811 --> 01:45:01.550
psycho history,
which is a,
is a,

1940
01:45:01.551 --> 01:45:05.270
is a line of history that a lot of people don't buy into and we,
and we,

1941
01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:07.610
when we did the show that way,
it's like Dan Carlin examines everything.

1942
01:45:07.611 --> 01:45:10.230
I mean it was,
I was over there basically talking to these guys and,
and,

1943
01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:12.890
and thinking about psycho history.
There's only a few people who do it,

1944
01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:18.190
but their contention was if you look at the child rearing practices that people

1945
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:23.270
used to do in the good old days,
I mean 100200500 7,000 years ago,

1946
01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.200
almost all of it would be classified if you did it today as the abuse and the

1947
01:45:30.501 --> 01:45:31.820
attitude on the part.
I mean,

1948
01:45:31.821 --> 01:45:36.821
the assumptions that these people make is if you could actually raise better

1949
01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:39.280
children knowing what we know now,
understanding what we know,

1950
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:43.430
you might actually change the human race because if,

1951
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:44.630
if child abuse,

1952
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:49.631
massive child abuse on a society wide level helps explain why the past is what

1953
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:52.760
it is with all the violence and carnage and horrific,

1954
01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:57.410
then could you change that outcome by raising better children?

1955
01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:02.150
And that might have something to do with what you're talking about here and not

1956
01:46:02.151 --> 01:46:06.770
be Utopian where you say,
listen,
the children that were raised well in the past,

1957
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:07.401
we're fine.

1958
01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:11.360
It's all these crazy people whose parents beat them with a chain that screwed up

1959
01:46:11.361 --> 01:46:11.841
the past.

1960
01:46:11.841 --> 01:46:14.810
What if you got rid of parents beating their children with a chain for the most

1961
01:46:14.811 --> 01:46:16.970
part?
Wouldn't society as a whole be better?

1962
01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:20.840
<v 0>She gets eaten shitty people make shitty people and that's what it is.</v>

1963
01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:22.250
So no one stops that chain.

1964
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:27.250
<v 2>So,
so again though,
how do you and,
and,
and,
and at what point,</v>

1965
01:46:27.251 --> 01:46:31.840
once again,
we get the problem is that you and I are noncoercive people,

1966
01:46:32.050 --> 01:46:35.620
but you get to a point where in order for our ideals to work,

1967
01:46:35.710 --> 01:46:39.700
somebody has to tell somebody you can't hit your child with a chain dude.

1968
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:41.650
And that's coercive.
So I mean,

1969
01:46:41.651 --> 01:46:45.610
so at some level we're still talking about forcing people to do something that

1970
01:46:45.611 --> 01:46:47.680
they don't want to do.
And where's the line?

1971
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:52.140
<v 0>Well,
fort not necessarily forcing people,
but inspiring them to do.</v>

1972
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.430
I'm inspiring you not to hit your child with the changing out a way to raise

1973
01:46:56.431 --> 01:46:58.740
people that,
first of all,

1974
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:03.890
making it much more voluntary when you have a child making it something that

1975
01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.510
you,
you know,
you,
you engineer,

1976
01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:08.730
whether it's through better birth control or through better,

1977
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:11.130
better education or through something,

1978
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:14.700
there's gotta be a way to make it a little bit more difficult for an asshole to

1979
01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:16.430
be raising a person and fucking that person.

1980
01:47:16.431 --> 01:47:20.130
The problem is those people don't really realize that they're not the people who

1981
01:47:20.131 --> 01:47:22.770
should be having kids,
but will they in 20 years,

1982
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:26.940
that's my thoughts will change the way we've changed the logo will change that.

1983
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:29.280
That guy will go online and go,
oh,
I shouldn't be a one.
Well,

1984
01:47:29.281 --> 01:47:32.640
I don't think it'll be as simple as going online.
That's what my point is.

1985
01:47:32.641 --> 01:47:34.530
My point is that it'll become a part of us.

1986
01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.590
The Internet is not going to be something that you plug into.

1987
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:40.530
It's going to be something that you experience all the time.

1988
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:41.850
That's just a matter of time.

1989
01:47:41.851 --> 01:47:44.020
They're already doing that with these Google glasses thing.

1990
01:47:44.021 --> 01:47:47.040
You might be right and it's right and I think it's going to eventually work its

1991
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:50.640
way into some sort of a contact lens or maybe even an implant.

1992
01:47:50.641 --> 01:47:53.410
There's going to be,
whether it's a hundred years from now,

1993
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.940
whether it's a thousand let's let the pessimists play with your idea because I

1994
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:58.170
think you're probably right.
I mean,

1995
01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:01.560
I can go there that you can't possibly imagine what it's going make matrix like

1996
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:03.660
practically plug it into the back of your head and go.

1997
01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:08.820
But don't you see the possibility for the op?
Remember there was a great monkeys.

1998
01:48:08.821 --> 01:48:11.020
Okay.
An age thing.
Remember the monkeys episodes?

1999
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.040
There was a great quotability Los [inaudible] on reruns.

2000
01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:19.020
Okay.
Growing up we saw it on reruns.
Remember there was the,

2001
01:48:19.021 --> 01:48:22.860
what were the TV you would turn the TV on and the TV would be looking back at

2002
01:48:22.861 --> 01:48:24.510
you and telling you to do things.
I mean,

2003
01:48:24.511 --> 01:48:28.080
in the same way that you see the freedom that a Google glass and the plug in all

2004
01:48:28.081 --> 01:48:32.130
the time can give you what if the person providing the message or the same

2005
01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:35.760
people that are telling us to go be at 147 countries all the time and go these

2006
01:48:35.761 --> 01:48:37.710
people in Iran,
they don't just speak differently.

2007
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.030
They're all a bunch of terrorism.
I mean,

2008
01:48:39.031 --> 01:48:44.031
what if the person delivering the stuff in the Google glass or matrix thing and

2009
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:47.760
the plug in the back of your head isn't benign?
No,
that's good point.

2010
01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:51.150
But I don't think it holds up because I think the accountability and

2011
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:51.870
responsibility,

2012
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:55.650
eventually there's going to be a trail from every action to the reaction and

2013
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:57.990
we're going to be able to follow those trails and the people will be held

2014
01:48:57.991 --> 01:48:58.500
accountable.

2015
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:03.390
It's the transparency that you see in your own life where the NSA's able to get

2016
01:49:03.391 --> 01:49:06.120
into your email.
We're talking to Edward Snowden and stuff right now.

2017
01:49:06.250 --> 01:49:09.900
I'm already talking about what's his face,
the fucking CIA guy.
The head Spook,

2018
01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:13.770
the general Patraeus who got busted because of an email exchange with a
mistress.

2019
01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.800
Can I one this backs up my theory though about if you're the head of the CIA and

2020
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:22.950
you're know that you're cheating and you know what will happen if that gets out.

2021
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.100
But you're the head of the CIA and you know what the CIA,

2022
01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:30.900
he knows it can find out how.
How'd that guy get?
I mean again,
it just,

2023
01:49:31.730 --> 01:49:35.070
you know what's funny is this is bringing it around full circle.

2024
01:49:35.071 --> 01:49:37.460
Cause I remember having this conversation the last time I was in,

2025
01:49:37.461 --> 01:49:38.430
in the house of rogue.

2026
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:41.130
It's impossible to avoid that conversation because it's one of the most

2027
01:49:41.131 --> 01:49:45.660
fascinating we got.
Did we get it?
We get into to to uh,
to Gary,

2028
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:48.040
hard to Musc.
We did.
Yeah.

2029
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:50.830
It's the type of human being that wants to run things.

2030
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:53.290
And I think that the idea of running things is preposterous.

2031
01:49:53.291 --> 01:49:55.750
I don't think anybody should be able to run things.
I in people,

2032
01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:00.160
so the collective,
all these people who want to run things,
how dare you.

2033
01:50:00.161 --> 01:50:02.950
You're not,
we the coercive don't want to run things.

2034
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:06.290
Government are telling you who want to run things to sit back on your rear end

2035
01:50:06.291 --> 01:50:07.450
because you're not allowed to run things.

2036
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:10.840
Even running scholarly things can be problematic.

2037
01:50:10.841 --> 01:50:13.210
And we were talking about that earlier that sometimes,
you know,

2038
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:15.220
professors who have tenure can like,

2039
01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:20.260
they can dominate over ideas and not want to bend because they've been human

2040
01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:25.240
nature because it's ego.
They've been teaching one way for so long.

2041
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:26.830
Some new information comes up.

2042
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.230
They want to fight that fucking shit tooth and nail.

2043
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:33.190
Even if it doesn't make any sense.
And it's not all the time,
but it's,
it happens.

2044
01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:36.580
It's just a weird thing that people do have power part me.

2045
01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:40.150
The funny thing is you're like at war with yourself cause half the time you're

2046
01:50:40.151 --> 01:50:42.630
like,
these people are so terrible.
Then the other half of the time we went,

2047
01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.950
I think we can evolve,
but I think it's human nature.

2048
01:50:44.951 --> 01:50:46.720
I personally believe that it's human nature.

2049
01:50:46.721 --> 01:50:51.310
Whenever any one person has ultimate power,
they abuse it and they're into sex,

2050
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:56.140
violence and dominance and all and these priests and these are human qualities.

2051
01:50:56.141 --> 01:50:59.980
Do.
This is what makes the drama of history that that,
you know,

2052
01:50:59.981 --> 01:51:00.551
I always say to people,

2053
01:51:00.551 --> 01:51:03.400
I don't know how you can't be in the history because it's sex and violence and

2054
01:51:04.050 --> 01:51:07.090
backstabbing and it's all this stuff we love in,
in,
in drama,

2055
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:11.270
but it's real and it's real because this is who we are.
Yes,

2056
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:14.230
but let's go back to our scenario where it's four of us living in a village

2057
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:16.180
somewhere.
Just the four of us,
the only people on the planet.

2058
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:20.110
If all of a sudden Jamie decided that he was the king and Jamie was going to

2059
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:23.650
cast rules and regulations,
Lord of the flies,
kill that mother.

2060
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:26.540
That's where shit goes wrong.
We're shit goes wrong.

2061
01:51:26.541 --> 01:51:28.090
It's were one person's in charge.

2062
01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:32.770
I know shit going wrong is no person nature's screwed up man.

2063
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:35.940
There's nothing he could do about that.
Is it screwed up or is it natural?

2064
01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:38.830
There's like only one way to get the pussy.
Sorry,
you got to control it.

2065
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:42.220
But here's the funny part is that we actually,
we actually,
uh,

2066
01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:44.470
glorify that would say he's got leadership skills.
Yes.

2067
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:49.030
He's a natural born leader and the rest of us should look up to that and allow

2068
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:50.020
him to make the decisions.
Yeah.

2069
01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.040
He's a pimp and were pussies and we're shocked when that same behavior repeats

2070
01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:58.270
itself over and over here.
It was like exactly what you've been saying,

2071
01:51:58.271 --> 01:51:58.960
Dan Carlin.

2072
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.200
What I'm saying is it doesn't have to stay that way and I really don't believe

2073
01:52:02.201 --> 01:52:04.480
it does.
I think that there's going to come a time,

2074
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:06.820
whether it's a thousand years now or a hundred years from now,

2075
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000
or 10 where there's a complete total accountability and an evolutionary jump and

2076
01:52:13.121 --> 01:52:17.680
the way we look at things and the way we look at behavior and information to the

2077
01:52:17.681 --> 01:52:19.020
way the people in the future going to.

2078
01:52:19.021 --> 01:52:22.450
That's going to be just as big of a leap as the way we look at the Internet to

2079
01:52:22.451 --> 01:52:24.100
the people that lived in Martin Luther's time.

2080
01:52:24.101 --> 01:52:27.280
Look at the idea of translating the Bible into something that you can actually

2081
01:52:27.281 --> 01:52:30.670
read.
I hope you are right.
I'm all,
I'm off Norton,
but the idea,

2082
01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.760
I mean it sounds great to me.
It could all go wrong.
Don't get me wrong,

2083
01:52:33.761 --> 01:52:35.980
and you know,
the proof is like,
as you said,

2084
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:39.970
it's wrong right now in several parts of the world.
You can go look in the Congo.

2085
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:43.780
It's wrong.
I'm not so sure it's right here.
It's not right here.

2086
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:46.060
I think we're all,
I think we're

2087
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.800
<v 2>on a precipice here where things could go either way.</v>

2088
01:52:48.801 --> 01:52:50.210
After we talked about this last time too,

2089
01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:54.800
where I'm not convinced that we're not in an era where we're going to look back

2090
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:57.610
on and go,
oh my God,
what did we do?
You know

2091
01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:02.570
<v 0>when you start looking at the way Obama is aging,
like they all do,
they all,</v>

2092
01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.520
they all do,
but when you see it again over and over again,

2093
01:53:05.521 --> 01:53:09.170
and he was one of the younger guys to get into office and just fucking look

2094
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.700
youthful and vital and now he's just like,
he's just dried out.

2095
01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:16.400
It's weird.
It's weird to say it sucks them down like prunes.

2096
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:20.210
It does mount of information that must come on that guys

2097
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:24.720
<v 2>desk everyday.
People witness people always.</v>

2098
01:53:24.721 --> 01:53:27.780
If you talk about politics and you know you do talk radio or whatever,

2099
01:53:27.781 --> 01:53:29.810
you're always going to get these couple of people get all the,

2100
01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:31.950
you should run for president.
You should shut your mouth.

2101
01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:33.300
Do you think to yourself,

2102
01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:36.660
you go and kill people because there's not a president's ever been and hasn't

2103
01:53:36.661 --> 01:53:39.840
had to order something that requires and this,
but here again,

2104
01:53:39.841 --> 01:53:42.870
you get to the point where you go,
but I'd love to have a president that said,

2105
01:53:42.871 --> 01:53:44.970
I'm not going to go in there,
kill anybody.
I mean,

2106
01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:49.560
because you think about a guy like President Obama or any of these guys and they

2107
01:53:49.561 --> 01:53:52.440
know they want to be president and they know that they're going to have,
well,

2108
01:53:52.441 --> 01:53:56.580
I'll tell you a story.
Um,
I got summoned to jury duty once a,

2109
01:53:56.581 --> 01:53:59.970
normally I get out of jury duty in a very George Carlin like fashion where I

2110
01:53:59.971 --> 01:54:03.690
basically go,
uh,
I don't believe in convicting people,

2111
01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:07.650
but somehow once I made it through and it was a drunk driving case and they took

2112
01:54:07.651 --> 01:54:10.170
me in there and they ask all these questions like,

2113
01:54:10.171 --> 01:54:13.170
does anybody know how the alcohol,

2114
01:54:13.171 --> 01:54:16.260
blood level content and somebody can be changed and nobody raised their hand.

2115
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.420
I'm going,
well,
you know,
you could eat and all these things and saying,
okay,

2116
01:54:18.810 --> 01:54:20.970
next question.
Does anybody,
and I raise my hand again.

2117
01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:23.820
By the fourth time I'm going to get diarrhea.
He looked at me like,

2118
01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:26.700
are you going to have a problem convicting this person?
And I go,

2119
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:29.160
I really can't have that on my conscience.
I go,
you know,

2120
01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:33.240
society runs because people are willing to do this.
And I said,
yeah,
but not me.
I,

2121
01:54:33.241 --> 01:54:36.810
you know,
I really,
I really,
I understand that,

2122
01:54:36.811 --> 01:54:40.830
but I can't have that on my head.
Even for a drunk driving conviction.

2123
01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:43.930
And so you go Dan Carlin for president.
Yeah.
But you know,

2124
01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:47.970
and nobody could get hurt and it doesn't work in all breaks down and it's done.

2125
01:54:47.971 --> 01:54:48.690
You know,

2126
01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:53.390
<v 0>he can't have a president.
I don't think there can be one.
I think in jury,
Judy,</v>

2127
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:56.600
right?
I mean,
the point is somebody has got to do that.
Eventually.

2128
01:54:56.601 --> 01:54:58.770
We're going to know who did what.
It's going to be in your head.

2129
01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:00.140
It's going to be unavoidable.

2130
01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.350
I think the way we record information right now is archaic.

2131
01:55:03.351 --> 01:55:08.060
We have these Shitty fucking biological,
uh,
hard drives and we record data,

2132
01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.340
we record memories,
we record ideas.

2133
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.800
And sometimes people don't even remember what the fuck they did.

2134
01:55:12.801 --> 01:55:14.930
I bet if you went to Oj right now and got,

2135
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:19.130
got inside of his head and got a memory of the actual event that where his wife

2136
01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:22.580
and her boyfriend was were killed.
I bet it would be chaos.

2137
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:23.670
I would bet it was better.

2138
01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.820
<v 2>I was with some people yesterday that I grew up with and they start telling me</v>

2139
01:55:26.821 --> 01:55:31.230
stories of my own life from the time and I'm going,
what,
what?

2140
01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:34.950
And then a certain things I kind of vaguely remembered and you're like,
wow,

2141
01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:37.360
that was a memory that was a long gone,
you know.

2142
01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.380
<v 0>No,
they've,
one of the recent discoveries that they've been able to show is,</v>

2143
01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:43.214
um,
they've,

2144
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:47.520
they've actually got proof that they can implant memories into a mouse is a new

2145
01:55:47.521 --> 01:55:51.120
study that they've done where they've actually shown that they can artificially

2146
01:55:51.121 --> 01:55:55.140
implement a memory into a mouse and just went back into my pessimism land.

2147
01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:57.940
That's how they're going to convict anybody who's dangerous in the future to get

2148
01:55:57.941 --> 01:56:02.040
an implant.
Do you know?
You actually,
I think it's going to go to shock your junk.

2149
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:04.560
And send it out to women.
Well,
it's in your brain,
isn't it?
If it isn't,

2150
01:56:04.610 --> 01:56:06.060
it'll be five minutes from now.

2151
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:10.430
I think the Dan Carlin would be the conspiratorial one big group of us.
I mean,

2152
01:56:10.431 --> 01:56:12.330
that's this knowledge that that's gonna.

2153
01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:16.420
I think you're going to be able to go back to this point right now and truth and

2154
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:20.580
desperately in Mike Martin Luther King in the future,

2155
01:56:20.581 --> 01:56:23.490
they're going to email a child porn onto your computer.

2156
01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:25.860
They're going to bust you and you're gone,
baby.
Well,

2157
01:56:25.861 --> 01:56:29.040
I think it's going to be one.
I think it's going one further than that.

2158
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:32.520
I think we're going to have an artificial way of recording things that's

2159
01:56:32.521 --> 01:56:35.910
indisputable and I think that you're going to have a hard time.

2160
01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:39.180
You're going to think you're going to have a hard draft for your life.

2161
01:56:39.210 --> 01:56:42.210
You're gonna have a hard drive for your life where your experiences are

2162
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:45.850
translated into some sort of a digital form denier.

2163
01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.040
When you're 30 years old,
you go to resurrection and they shoot you down.

2164
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:53.770
That's true.
Life playing out before your eyes.
That's what it literally is.

2165
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:58.740
What's funny is we both see the same thing and you just see the good outcome.

2166
01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:03.090
And I'm thinking,
Oh my God,
do you know why?
Because you're a better person.

2167
01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:09.200
Because I experienced that and I know a above my own battles with the chimpanzee

2168
01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:11.980
DNA and my own,
uh,

2169
01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.070
ideas about becoming a more enlightened person or a more empathetic and kind and

2170
01:57:17.071 --> 01:57:22.071
loving person and myself who are still chimpanzees and will always be less than

2171
01:57:22.321 --> 01:57:25.200
ever my whole life.
Less than it was my mind.
They run into,

2172
01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:29.520
I've had a bunch of those guys just pass away too,
man.
They have all too,
if you,

2173
01:57:29.521 --> 01:57:32.520
if you surround yourself with a bunch of people that are trying to achieve

2174
01:57:32.521 --> 01:57:34.890
similar goals,
you can support each other and help each other.

2175
01:57:34.891 --> 01:57:37.450
And I think the community that,
uh,

2176
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:39.630
I've been able to be a part of just with my friends,

2177
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.550
shows me that there's hope for the idea of [inaudible] with chimps anymore,

2178
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.950
but the chimps are hanging out together.
We're reinforcing,

2179
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:50.670
have plenty of chimp friends who know how to manage their chimpanzee.

2180
01:57:50.671 --> 01:57:53.150
Like my friend Tate,
he's a perfect example of a champion.

2181
01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:56.700
Was at a manage being a champ.
He just trains a lot,
does a lot of Jujitsu,

2182
01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.270
does a lot of reading,
thinks a lot.
He's very thoughtful about it.

2183
01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:03.390
And then he's got his idea,
he's got his,
come on Brian,

2184
01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:07.050
he's got his idea of what,
you know,
what,
what,

2185
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.730
what constitutes being a good person?
What constitutes being noble?
You know?

2186
01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:12.320
And he pursues that and he,
and it's,

2187
01:58:12.321 --> 01:58:15.360
it's infectious and it's kind of contagious when you're around people that are

2188
01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:16.920
trying to do things along the sames lines,

2189
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:20.250
same lines when they're trying to improve,
you want to improve yourself.

2190
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.290
The problem is people imitate their atmosphere.

2191
01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.870
And if your atmosphere is living with the fucking mon goals,

2192
01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:26.510
if your atmosphere is you're,

2193
01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:31.520
you're hanging out with these savages that are wearing my skin jackets and chop

2194
01:58:31.981 --> 01:58:35.730
and babies' heads off for a goof,
like that's your world then this is,

2195
01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:38.340
this is where you live.
Try,
try stopping that.

2196
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:41.830
Because human beings operates so much on momentum,

2197
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.210
<v 3>it's very difficult and you have to also have to have like a,
a time of,</v>

2198
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.710
of ultimate resources where you can actually stop and rest and reconsider how

2199
01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:51.610
things are being done.

2200
01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:55.000
Because otherwise you're basically pushing forward for survival every day,

2201
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:59.320
which allows you almost a zero time for introspection when you're inside of a

2202
01:58:59.321 --> 01:59:04.321
city and there's 100,000 fucking savages on horseback with bows and arrows that

2203
01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:09.700
take a hundred and how many pounds to pull them?
Hundred and 47 Jesus Christ.

2204
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.220
Ted Nugent uses a 45 pound compound bow.

2205
01:59:12.250 --> 01:59:15.640
You should see what those people who can do that over and over look like.
Oh,

2206
01:59:15.641 --> 01:59:19.900
they must be like chimps.
Sinewy monsters.
Yeah.
And then it hold onto the horses,

2207
01:59:19.901 --> 01:59:23.150
but just their legs and he's saying,
shoot from underneath the belly.
Wow.

2208
01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:26.380
Holding on with your legs.
The legs are leg.
It's like a,

2209
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:28.720
like a Jujitsu guard did develop,

2210
01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:32.350
been doing it since they were two or three of these are like old muscles.

2211
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:36.280
You know the crazy,
well,
it becomes a part of that though too.

2212
01:59:36.281 --> 01:59:37.990
They talked about how these people were just,

2213
01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:42.040
I mean cause it's so in their culture that it's been going on since they were.

2214
01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:43.600
So cause you know,
you know this,

2215
01:59:43.601 --> 01:59:46.870
I mean muscles are different and after you reached puberty then before,

2216
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:51.190
but if you are using those same muscles from the time you're two or three,

2217
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:53.980
it gets,
I mean they don't get large and bulky,

2218
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:57.810
they just get like iron and sinewy and it's a whole different strength.

2219
01:59:57.811 --> 02:00:02.620
But it's also a neurological strength from doing a movement over muscle memory,

2220
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:06.220
muscle memory.
But it's also a path like,
you know,
when you tie your shoes,

2221
02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.920
you know like that and you just tie your shoes but you don't think about it.

2222
02:00:08.921 --> 02:00:12.690
You just tie your shoes.
That happens in Jujitsu.
Okay.
And Jujitsu,

2223
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.640
when you choke guys out enough,
before you even realize it,

2224
02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:16.600
you're choking somebody out.

2225
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:20.020
You're like literally sinking up the choke before you even know what you did.

2226
02:00:20.110 --> 02:00:21.730
Someone spins you counter.

2227
02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:26.050
It all happens completely outside of conscious thought and it's,

2228
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:29.590
it's happening with extreme strength.
Think about that with the Mongols a lot.

2229
02:00:29.591 --> 02:00:31.190
What you just mentioned yet.
No.
And,
and,

2230
02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.590
and that is the kind of thing where it was,
you know,

2231
02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:37.570
I remember you trying to sum up what we said.
What are you talking about?

2232
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:40.720
Their viciousness.
And I remember thinking,
I don't really think of it that way.

2233
02:00:40.721 --> 02:00:43.660
I think it's more like what you just mentioned where it's more of a,

2234
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:47.550
they don't even think about it then.
That's not life.
That's not vicious.
It's,

2235
02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.240
it's just a,
okay.
You know,
it's just okay.
I,
it's,

2236
02:00:51.241 --> 02:00:54.400
it's even when it's so ingrained in you,

2237
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:58.320
you don't have to be vicious to do those things.
That's just okay.
You know,

2238
02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:02.170
choke them out.
Right.
Done.
You know?
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
it's just done.
Yeah.

2239
02:01:02.171 --> 02:01:05.320
They just,
it just,
it's a part of your everyday life.

2240
02:01:05.321 --> 02:01:08.130
You don't know any and no one's saying,
hey man,
wouldn't it be nice?

2241
02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.080
I'll cut that person's head off.
I did it.
I did it yesterday.

2242
02:01:11.081 --> 02:01:11.830
I'll do it again tomorrow.

2243
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:15.500
It's like taking out the trash when you're dealing with like Gin China with the

2244
02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.120
story of how many did he kill?
They're a million.
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

2245
02:01:19.121 --> 02:01:20.410
Nobody knows.
They killed everyone.

2246
02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:24.670
This is a place that if you didn't surrender or if you didn't give in,

2247
02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:27.940
they often killed everyone.
And the attitude was,
if we kill everyone here,

2248
02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:31.930
the next place will give in more easily.
And there's a thing that we do today,
uh,

2249
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:35.440
that people been really criticizing.
That's these double tap drones.

2250
02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:39.590
And the idea is that they shoot these missiles in and then when the people come

2251
02:01:39.591 --> 02:01:43.910
to collect the bodies in the sick,
they shoot in another round.
Mongols did that.

2252
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:48.740
Yeah,
the Mongols did that.
And the stories are horrific mass and you,

2253
02:01:48.741 --> 02:01:53.741
you're fucking style of doing a podcast with is so dramatic and so intense that

2254
02:01:54.621 --> 02:01:58.490
like you feel like you're there for mother fuckers.
A trout tell you the truth.

2255
02:01:58.491 --> 02:02:00.980
We didn't do that with the last one and we didn't.
And people say,

2256
02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:02.690
well it didn't sound like one of your regular shows,

2257
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.460
but you think if you want to do this,

2258
02:02:04.461 --> 02:02:06.680
like I would love to do this into the future.

2259
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.720
And if you make the same movie every time and it begins the same way because I

2260
02:02:11.721 --> 02:02:16.720
love the way it begins and it eventually it loses its ability to ACDC song.

2261
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:18.950
But I'm keep making the same fucking song.

2262
02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:23.510
So the point is is that when we go back to that style you like,

2263
02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:26.480
it will be a little fresh again and you will go,
oh yeah but,

2264
02:02:26.481 --> 02:02:29.840
but like the last one is a little bit more straight up,
a little bit less drama.

2265
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:30.690
The net,
you know we,
we,

2266
02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:34.280
we take the same ingredients and we mix them in different amounts.

2267
02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.400
So if you go to like con or Ostrander,
you'll go,

2268
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:39.050
oh that's the traditional formula.

2269
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:41.810
But then we switch it up with other ones so you don't get tired of it.

2270
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:46.070
Well you sort of have to do con the way you've done it.
Now that you've done it,

2271
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:50.480
if it,
if there's anything like that,
it's so,
it's so dynamic the way you did it.

2272
02:02:50.481 --> 02:02:53.030
Like this is only one way to tell that fucking story.

2273
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:55.300
You gotta tell that story the way he told that,
cause nobody ever,

2274
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.460
ever told it before.
Where I gave a shit.
I mean,
I was,

2275
02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:01.850
I was interested enough to pick up a few books and look at some pictures.

2276
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:06.320
And while the hunt fucking wolves with eagles,
how crazy.
Really crazy.

2277
02:03:06.321 --> 02:03:10.040
To this day,
they hunt wolves with eagles.
They have trained eagles,

2278
02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:12.170
they send them out and they kill walls.
I mean,

2279
02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:14.630
they're the most gangster human beings that have ever existed.

2280
02:03:14.631 --> 02:03:17.390
And the truth of the matter is,
is that the Mongols were just the,

2281
02:03:17.410 --> 02:03:22.410
the greatest version of a people in a culture that has existed since almost time

2282
02:03:23.631 --> 02:03:28.230
in memorial.
The huns,
the Turks,
I mean,
uh,
the skiff,
Ian's,

2283
02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:30.710
the [inaudible],
these are all the same,
you know,

2284
02:03:30.711 --> 02:03:33.830
if you think about like the way the native Americans lived on the plains,
right?

2285
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:38.180
It's a culture that works because it's so meshed with the geography and the

2286
02:03:38.181 --> 02:03:41.840
climate and the ecology that once you find a system that works,

2287
02:03:41.841 --> 02:03:45.310
you stick with it because,
you know,
nature's harsh.
Exactly.

2288
02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:50.500
So the Mongols were that culture and those cultures were very influenced by

2289
02:03:51.171 --> 02:03:52.760
whoever was nearby.
For example,

2290
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:56.930
if you're trading or rating the culture and it's Chinese,

2291
02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.360
you begin to look a little Chinese.
The clothes you rated were Chinese,
you know,

2292
02:04:01.361 --> 02:04:02.181
and,
and the,

2293
02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:06.410
the Mongol types that were in the West looked a lot like Russians or wherever

2294
02:04:06.411 --> 02:04:08.240
you were rating and trading with.
Right.

2295
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:13.450
So the Mongols infused some of that Chinese culture into that step tradition.

2296
02:04:14.521 --> 02:04:18.590
So they were like Sioux Indians that have some Chinese in them now as opposed to

2297
02:04:18.591 --> 02:04:20.330
Sioux Indians that have some Russian in them.

2298
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.220
And then they take that Chinese little little ti tint on them and go into a

2299
02:04:25.221 --> 02:04:28.970
place like Russia that's really backward when they invaded.
And Oh my God,

2300
02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:31.940
it's like the Chinese are like the first world during this time period and the

2301
02:04:31.941 --> 02:04:33.110
Russians are like living in,

2302
02:04:33.111 --> 02:04:37.400
in grass huts and it must have been just devastating.

2303
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:38.790
Just devastating.

2304
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:44.350
The Mongols went into Russia in the winter and the only people who do that

2305
02:04:44.761 --> 02:04:47.280
deliberately,
that is the craziest,

2306
02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.890
and they came from the Russians are really nasty.

2307
02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:53.370
If you tried to invade from the west,
talk to the Swedes,
talk to the Germans,

2308
02:04:53.371 --> 02:04:56.850
doctor,
the Poles.
It's a nightmare.
You lose everybody in those winters.

2309
02:04:57.210 --> 02:05:00.810
The Mongols come in from the other direction and Oman,
they just,
they,

2310
02:05:00.811 --> 02:05:04.710
it's like a tidal wave and they came in with all these sophisticated artillery

2311
02:05:04.711 --> 02:05:08.100
devices from China and the,
and the Russians have like these little,

2312
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:09.840
it looks like Fort Apache.
They have these,

2313
02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:12.650
these forts that have like big logs and the,

2314
02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:16.440
and the Mongols come in with these stone throwing things and their shit shooting

2315
02:05:16.441 --> 02:05:21.240
human fat that they've lit on fire onto these would fats buildings and it's like

2316
02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:22.243
napalm,

2317
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:27.790
that idea of human factor or human heads or they would send your,

2318
02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:28.980
they'd send your prints,

2319
02:05:28.981 --> 02:05:32.610
they'd capture your prince and then he'd be flying over the walls at you and the

2320
02:05:32.611 --> 02:05:36.210
mom.
The Mongols understood psychological warfare as well as anyone.

2321
02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:40.990
Someone needs to do that movie.
Fuck 300 someone needs to do a real,
cause.
I,

2322
02:05:40.991 --> 02:05:45.600
I saw a Mongol.
The Ganga is con movies.
Yeah,
I know.
That's how I feel too.

2323
02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:49.010
It's just like,
come on.
It's like a PBS fan is like the,

2324
02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.870
it was an ABC after school special.
Like he was in love with the girl,
you know,

2325
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:54.630
choose me as your wife and listen,
if you read some of the current,
I mean,

2326
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:57.030
there were some books out there that had been on the New York bestseller lists

2327
02:05:57.150 --> 02:06:01.380
where they make him sound like George Washington.
And I always say yes,

2328
02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:05.010
if George Washington were responsible for 50 to 70 million deaths or however

2329
02:06:05.011 --> 02:06:09.540
many it was,
I mean,
look,
yes,
the guy,
I mean,
they always say,
well look,

2330
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:12.150
he started the renaissance and he,
he brought culture from east to west.

2331
02:06:12.151 --> 02:06:13.620
That's what they say about Alexandra too.

2332
02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.720
But if you're on the receiving end of Alexander the Great,

2333
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:18.150
you don't care what he brought Hellenism to your society.

2334
02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:21.750
You weren't there to see it or hear doe,
your daughter's got tensioner.
You know,

2335
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:24.930
it's a weird justification.
Well,
it's like we said in that show though,

2336
02:06:24.931 --> 02:06:26.190
historians always say,
well,

2337
02:06:26.191 --> 02:06:29.340
look at how much our modern society has benefited from what the Mongols did.

2338
02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:31.860
Yeah.
But we didn't pay the bill.
We ate the food.

2339
02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:34.830
But the people that paid the bill and who lived through it,
you know,
had to,

2340
02:06:34.831 --> 02:06:37.410
had to,
had to do those accounts that we read.
And then I always say,

2341
02:06:37.411 --> 02:06:38.101
they always say,
well,
you know,

2342
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:41.070
those are very biased accounts because you know they were Mongols enemies.

2343
02:06:41.071 --> 02:06:41.281
I said,

2344
02:06:41.281 --> 02:06:44.970
that's like saying you can't listen to the Jews explain the Holocaust because

2345
02:06:44.971 --> 02:06:47.590
they've,
they're a little too vested in it.
You know,
it's exactly there.

2346
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.920
They're really biased about that holocaust thing.

2347
02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:54.840
Will you also made really good comparisons between Nazi Germany and the Mongols

2348
02:06:54.841 --> 02:06:58.680
because of this very fact of history?
Is that history there,
you know?
Yes.

2349
02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:01.770
There is a fact that it opened up trade routes and the change.

2350
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:04.770
That's where your mom benefits.
Good things did happen.

2351
02:07:04.771 --> 02:07:08.490
But you can only say that because it was from 1200 we don't know any of those

2352
02:07:08.491 --> 02:07:11.160
people that guide to make it by listen,
Hitler and the Volkswagen,

2353
02:07:11.161 --> 02:07:13.320
we wouldn't have Volkswagen's today man.
I mean,
and,

2354
02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:16.320
and someday that'll be a bigger deal.
And it was a really,

2355
02:07:16.321 --> 02:07:18.420
the way you were talking about that,

2356
02:07:18.421 --> 02:07:21.350
it was like you had a really like choose your words carefully.
Yes.

2357
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:24.480
And you still do,
I just threw that out there a little.
Brian,
can we edit that?

2358
02:07:24.490 --> 02:07:28.380
That might get me in trouble later.
Yeah.
You,
um,
you have to like,

2359
02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:32.640
but the reality is a hundred years from now when people talk about the,

2360
02:07:32.641 --> 02:07:36.100
the concentration camps and people talk about it,
it will be just

2361
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.660
<v 0>like we talk about the inquisition today.</v>

2362
02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:40.680
<v 4>I think the fact that you had to choose your words carefully,</v>

2363
02:07:40.710 --> 02:07:43.350
it shows what we're talking about.
There were places.

2364
02:07:43.351 --> 02:07:47.490
Can you imagine going to the people who literally watched,
I mean,

2365
02:07:47.491 --> 02:07:50.490
it was like a bomb going off when the Mongols hit eastern Persia.

2366
02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.050
Imagine going to those people and saying,

2367
02:07:52.051 --> 02:07:54.510
somebody's going to write a book someday comparing the guy who did this to

2368
02:07:54.511 --> 02:07:57.330
George Washington who they wouldn't know,
but just,
I mean,
this is,
you know,

2369
02:07:57.331 --> 02:07:59.130
he's going to be a great hero and you're going to go,

2370
02:07:59.430 --> 02:08:03.330
what the guy who just destroyed everything I could see for,
you know,
everything.

2371
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.860
Men,
women,
everybody.
I knew died and yeah,
it's,

2372
02:08:08.130 --> 02:08:10.350
but that,
but to be fair to the mon goals,

2373
02:08:10.590 --> 02:08:14.310
that's a lot bigger part of human history.
They just were better at it.

2374
02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.380
They just did it on a higher scale.

2375
02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:19.080
There's a bazillion Mongol conquest in world history.

2376
02:08:19.170 --> 02:08:23.010
The Mongols are just the champions,
you know,
they just took it to the hot there.

2377
02:08:23.011 --> 02:08:25.560
The Muhammad Ali of the,
of the,
you know,

2378
02:08:25.561 --> 02:08:29.550
destroying the civilizations around them.
People.
There've been a lot of,
uh,

2379
02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:30.570
Floyd Patterson's,

2380
02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:35.700
<v 0>yeah,
it's funny way of putting it.
Um,
if you,
you,
you compare,
uh,</v>

2381
02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.600
the,
the cruelties of society,
there's always been great trends of cruelty.

2382
02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:42.660
There's always been horrible things that people have done to ensure that there

2383
02:08:42.661 --> 02:08:45.300
was no dissent.
It's just been a part of human history.

2384
02:08:45.301 --> 02:08:50.130
It's just the Mongols said,
okay,
let's ramp this bitch up to 10.
Let's,
let's see.

2385
02:08:50.131 --> 02:08:50.940
What's the craziest Shit

2386
02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:51.180
<v 4>we are?</v>

2387
02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:54.270
Some historians will say that some of it was timing too because there were guys

2388
02:08:54.271 --> 02:08:58.770
like Genghis Khan that arose in those same people's before the Byzantines who

2389
02:08:58.771 --> 02:09:03.330
were the,
the the successor state to the Romans were so good at,
at,

2390
02:09:03.331 --> 02:09:05.160
at like they had intelligence services that,

2391
02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.850
that were other tribes who would say,
listen,
you need to watch this guy.
He's,

2392
02:09:08.851 --> 02:09:11.220
he's amassing a lot of pot and the Byzantines and say,
okay,

2393
02:09:11.221 --> 02:09:14.130
here's 50,000 drachmas or whatever.

2394
02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.340
Make sure that guy doesn't see the morning.
And they would,
they would,

2395
02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:20.400
they would strangle these leaders on the rise in the cradle.

2396
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:24.270
Some people have said that the reason Genghis Khan got to be Genghis Khan is

2397
02:09:24.271 --> 02:09:27.120
because the Chinese and the business and all these people were kind of at a low

2398
02:09:27.121 --> 02:09:27.690
ebb.

2399
02:09:27.690 --> 02:09:32.170
Otherwise they'd had that guy assassinated or taken out long before because the,

2400
02:09:32.171 --> 02:09:36.570
the major societies around them,
to them,
those are national security threats.

2401
02:09:36.570 --> 02:09:39.660
When you get these guys who were taking these tribes who normally fight each

2402
02:09:39.661 --> 02:09:42.540
other and pulling them together to become dangerous,

2403
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:46.620
that's the scariest thing in the world to China and to the [inaudible].

2404
02:09:46.770 --> 02:09:49.980
The Byzantines into the Persians and they worked really hard to make sure that

2405
02:09:49.981 --> 02:09:52.320
didn't happen.
They would,
you know,
pay off one tribe.

2406
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:54.060
The Russians were very good at this later on,

2407
02:09:54.170 --> 02:09:56.850
pay off one tribe to destroy another tribe.

2408
02:09:56.851 --> 02:10:01.260
And the reason the Russians dealt with the Mongols successors that way.
Exactly,

2409
02:10:01.410 --> 02:10:04.950
they would go to one and go,
I know you love our stuff.
You know,

2410
02:10:04.951 --> 02:10:05.610
we'll give you some,

2411
02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:10.320
I got a fantastic suit of armor for and 500 muskets if you'll go attack this

2412
02:10:10.321 --> 02:10:13.590
other tribe right now.
And,
and that's how they kept them apart.

2413
02:10:13.591 --> 02:10:17.250
The only danger was when they would come together and some people think that the

2414
02:10:17.250 --> 02:10:19.890
Genghis Khan thing happened because the people that normally,
you know,

2415
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.600
and this goes back to what the people that say to me,
Dan,

2416
02:10:21.601 --> 02:10:24.030
the reason we don't have world war three is because America keeps everything

2417
02:10:24.031 --> 02:10:27.270
done.
Well in those days it was China and Byzantium and the eastern Persian,

2418
02:10:27.271 --> 02:10:27.840
but keep the,

2419
02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.290
the Mongols and all those people from coalescing and they were at a week cab and

2420
02:10:31.291 --> 02:10:34.130
the Mongols coalesced.
And look what happened of your isolation is

2421
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.160
<v 0>policies.
Dan.
Yeah,</v>

2422
02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:40.010
because you're a fucking go into the step and deal with that.

2423
02:10:40.011 --> 02:10:43.700
We all got Genghis Khan.
Thank you very much Carlin.
You know it's,

2424
02:10:43.730 --> 02:10:48.730
it's really hard for people to even put themselves in state of mind that the,

2425
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:54.581
those people must have experienced back when you didn't know what groups were

2426
02:10:54.921 --> 02:10:56.720
around the corner.
Like when they,

2427
02:10:56.750 --> 02:11:00.800
when people met the Germans for the first time and they literally didn't know

2428
02:11:00.801 --> 02:11:04.350
that they existed and they were scary as,
I mean like we with 300 units,

2429
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:06.230
if you were going to make that movie today,

2430
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:08.930
you have to make the Germans monsters.
So be like,

2431
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:12.290
one of the beautiful things about your story was what we talked about of them,

2432
02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:16.850
the Caribbean Shaw sending these people out to go check out China and see what's

2433
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:19.400
going on there.
If there's anything good for them,
is this worth invading?
He's,

2434
02:11:19.401 --> 02:11:21.260
he's never been to China and as,

2435
02:11:21.261 --> 02:11:23.660
as they're going like they don't even know what the fuck is there.

2436
02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:26.750
They come to this fantastic,
beautiful city.

2437
02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.610
Bigger than anything they've ever seen.

2438
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:33.640
Never seen anything like that and someone fuck them up and killed all of them.

2439
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:37.640
So they're like,
oh shit,
like didn't even know what the fuck was over the hill.

2440
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:40.160
They got over the hill and they're like,
oh Jesus,
will you look at this?

2441
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:44.390
We find an alien civilization on a planet that's amazing and somebody beat the

2442
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:45.620
hell out of them and you just go,

2443
02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.410
I was scared of this civilization that got the heck beat out of it.

2444
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.720
What the heck could do that?
Yeah.

2445
02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:53.120
They have nuclear bombs and light sabers and someone came and just decide to use

2446
02:11:53.121 --> 02:11:54.110
them for gasoline,

2447
02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.890
stuffed them into their space and not all of a sudden I'm really afraid.
Yeah.

2448
02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.550
I mean it's that those times when things like,

2449
02:12:01.551 --> 02:12:03.590
like when they first discovered the Germans,
when,

2450
02:12:03.591 --> 02:12:07.170
when you know a story on this a million times.
Yeah.
When,

2451
02:12:07.171 --> 02:12:10.820
when one civilization finds another one.
Listen,
I always wonder if,
if,

2452
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:14.150
if the new world hadn't been discovered what it was by,

2453
02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:17.390
by Christopher Columbus and all that discovered in air quotes.
Always.
I do that.

2454
02:12:17.530 --> 02:12:18.020
Um,

2455
02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:21.530
what would the people in the northern part of the United States have fought when

2456
02:12:21.531 --> 02:12:25.850
the Aztecs or whoever was going to have a giant civilization and in Mexico or

2457
02:12:25.851 --> 02:12:28.010
whatever showed up on their doorstep.

2458
02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:31.040
That would have been the nightmare of all time for those poor tribal people.

2459
02:12:31.041 --> 02:12:31.520
You know,

2460
02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.690
it was interesting how the way you described it was like the depictions of the

2461
02:12:35.691 --> 02:12:39.680
those early cultures too is like these people at all this cattle and all this

2462
02:12:39.681 --> 02:12:42.860
milk and they got really big and strong because of that.

2463
02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:44.870
But they also did whatever the fuck they wanted.

2464
02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.350
So when it come to like real discipline and hard work and like endurance,

2465
02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.580
they didn't really have it.

2466
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:53.480
It's like people always have like a certain amount of strength because of their

2467
02:12:53.481 --> 02:12:58.310
uniqueness,
but there's also a vulnerability to it.
Like Gingiss con,

2468
02:12:58.430 --> 02:13:02.150
he had all this money and all this riches in and he had some kids and the kids

2469
02:13:02.151 --> 02:13:05.090
grew up rich and they were all fucked up and eventually falls apart.

2470
02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:07.640
Well they used to say about the Germans when they were fighting the Romans and

2471
02:13:07.641 --> 02:13:10.400
the Germans were a young people,
young people to the Romans anyway.

2472
02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:14.000
And these Germans were being,
and the Celts to earlier even than that,

2473
02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.450
the Celts were like the earlier Germans to the Romans.
Um,
they're big,

2474
02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:22.220
they're strong,
they're ferocious,
but they lack endurance.
They lacked discipline.

2475
02:13:22.221 --> 02:13:24.680
Although the Germans could be very disciplined at times.
And they used to say,

2476
02:13:24.681 --> 02:13:28.190
if you could just get 500 Roman soldiers working together,

2477
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.250
you could beat 2000 of these tribes been acting as individuals.

2478
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:35.320
<v 4>And,
and,
and that's,
and you know,
there are a whole historians who,</v>

2479
02:13:35.321 --> 02:13:40.321
who basically said that it was civilizations organization that would compensate

2480
02:13:40.801 --> 02:13:44.310
for the lack of ferocity because civilization kind of weakens man.
And you don't,

2481
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:47.400
everybody's not killing each other in the cities and you have laws and you grow

2482
02:13:47.401 --> 02:13:48.234
up nice and,

2483
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:51.240
and these people are killing each other while they grow up and drunk and you

2484
02:13:51.241 --> 02:13:53.880
know,
the whole thing.
And to compensate for that,

2485
02:13:53.881 --> 02:13:57.630
it's organization and we form into units and we act under a discipline
commander.

2486
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:01.500
And that compensates for the fact that they're much more ferocious than we are.

2487
02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:05.030
<v 0>Yeah.
What was the Gingiss con quote about,
uh,</v>

2488
02:14:05.031 --> 02:14:07.580
an army of donkeys led by a man,

2489
02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:11.150
<v 4>Alexander the Great's got one of those two were where it's an army of donkeys</v>

2490
02:14:11.151 --> 02:14:14.600
led by a lion will beat an army of lions led by a donkey.

2491
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:18.600
<v 0>That's how fucking off is that a Alexander the Great's quote?
Both.
Both.</v>

2492
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:21.060
They both,
they've got similar lines.

2493
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:23.350
How much of those quotes do they attribute to great people?

2494
02:14:23.351 --> 02:14:27.540
It's just people making up shit about what they said.
At least you don't know.

2495
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:28.530
It's not a weird thing,

2496
02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:33.050
<v 4>but they used to say that,
uh,
I actually asked a great historian,</v>

2497
02:14:33.051 --> 02:14:35.960
I don't remember which one I asked that question about how much of this,

2498
02:14:35.961 --> 02:14:38.870
because they used to say history is a bunch of lies agreed upon.

2499
02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:41.630
And you say to yourself,
okay,
how much of this stuff is real?

2500
02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:46.340
And archeology has helped a lot with confirming this or confirming that,

2501
02:14:46.341 --> 02:14:50.270
but it's not very good for statements.
Here's the part I love.

2502
02:14:50.271 --> 02:14:53.420
I still love the fact that there was a whole lot of written material that hasn't

2503
02:14:53.421 --> 02:14:57.920
been discovered yet.
Um,
we're going to find,
and we do find periodically these,

2504
02:14:57.921 --> 02:14:58.371
these,
you know,

2505
02:14:58.371 --> 02:15:02.690
you'll break into some basement somewhere and find 10,000 scrolls or something

2506
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:03.950
and oh boy,

2507
02:15:03.951 --> 02:15:07.160
all of a sudden we can fill in because history is like a jigsaw puzzle and

2508
02:15:07.161 --> 02:15:09.870
historians are putting that to,
I'm not a historian by the way.
Let me emphasize,

2509
02:15:09.930 --> 02:15:13.880
I always emphasize that.
Um,
what,
what separates you?
You don't have a phd?

2510
02:15:13.881 --> 02:15:18.130
I have a degree,
but yes,
you need a Phd.
You that makes you a story.
Well,
yeah.
And,

2511
02:15:18.131 --> 02:15:20.990
and,
and basically what happens when you become a historian is one,

2512
02:15:20.991 --> 02:15:22.100
you really specialize.

2513
02:15:22.101 --> 02:15:25.610
So I don't think I would be able to talk about all these different things and

2514
02:15:25.611 --> 02:15:28.250
how they interact as much.
The other,
you're a history enthusiasts.

2515
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.730
I always say I'm a fan.
Yes.
Um,
but I do have a degree in it.
Uh,
the,
the,

2516
02:15:31.731 --> 02:15:35.030
the historian also studies a lot about what's called historiography,

2517
02:15:35.031 --> 02:15:37.760
which I find fascinating.
And which is what we're talking about here,

2518
02:15:37.761 --> 02:15:40.970
which is how does this stuff make it into history books.

2519
02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:44.960
And then how do we filter out Joe Schmoes bias when he wrote it,

2520
02:15:44.961 --> 02:15:48.230
when that guy wrote this horrible thing about the Mongols or conversely,

2521
02:15:48.231 --> 02:15:52.160
which happened a lot when they write this really glowing thing about the
Mongols.

2522
02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.870
How do I filter that?

2523
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:57.200
Cause a lot of these guys you wrote great things about the Mongols were living

2524
02:15:57.201 --> 02:16:01.070
under the Mongols and had to show their stuff to the Mongols before it could be

2525
02:16:01.071 --> 02:16:01.930
published as has.

2526
02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:05.420
So here I got this stuff I wrote about Genghis Khan where I said he killed a

2527
02:16:05.421 --> 02:16:10.220
bazillion people.
Uh,
cut your head off now for writing that.
So you know the,
his,

2528
02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:14.690
the historians when they learn historiography are trying to learn how to compare

2529
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:18.290
this source with that source and then filter out their biases as well as they

2530
02:16:18.291 --> 02:16:22.040
can.
And this can get crazy though later on when sometimes they say,

2531
02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:25.820
we can't trust anybody.
Okay then why are we doing history at all?

2532
02:16:25.821 --> 02:16:26.880
And it gets silly at a certain,

2533
02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.180
<v 0>it's almost like every piece of information has to be disseminated with a
caveat.</v>

2534
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.150
You have to kind of say,
well,
here's what we do that,
yeah,

2535
02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:36.140
<v 4>a lot.
In the last show we did,
I had to say,</v>

2536
02:16:36.141 --> 02:16:38.840
you know in the show there's a lot of famous quotes connected to the Spanish

2537
02:16:38.841 --> 02:16:41.450
American war period and almost everything I read that was new.

2538
02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:44.760
<v 0>Yeah,
we don't think they said that.
He had to say,
Ooh,
I love this quote,</v>

2539
02:16:44.761 --> 02:16:46.960
but I have to say that people don't think they said it anymore.
Well,

2540
02:16:47.010 --> 02:16:48.930
I love the fact that you include that though.

2541
02:16:48.931 --> 02:16:52.890
That's a really enlightening part of the podcast because it sort of paints this

2542
02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:57.750
really accurate picture of what information is available to us.

2543
02:16:57.751 --> 02:16:59.070
Like when you're talking about Gingiss count,

2544
02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.990
they didn't know what fucking color his hair was.
No.

2545
02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:03.980
Some people say you had red hair.
Well,
a lot of the step people did.

2546
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:07.530
So they had hair.
Oh,
well you know ginger one here

2547
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:12.160
<v 4>love.
I love,
love,
love.
When you,
when you do the history of China,</v>

2548
02:17:12.161 --> 02:17:15.040
the Chinese were fascinated by it and it was a national security thing.

2549
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:17.590
They had to know about these tribes on their border just in case they all got

2550
02:17:17.591 --> 02:17:19.210
together and combined.
And they would,

2551
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.330
they would divide these tribes based on what they look like cause otherwise,

2552
02:17:22.331 --> 02:17:23.470
how do you know when,
you know,
like if he,

2553
02:17:23.471 --> 02:17:25.390
if you have a whole bunch of native Americans on your border,

2554
02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:28.030
how do you say these are the Cheyenne and they look like these but these are,

2555
02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:29.980
these are Comanche and they look like that.

2556
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.550
So they're trying to help you understand,
you know,
because this is the,

2557
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:37.950
and a lot of these tribes on the borders of Modern Day China have green eyes,

2558
02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:41.080
red hair,
blonde hair,
and then you get these weird mixes.

2559
02:17:41.081 --> 02:17:43.450
Cause they were combined and,
and,
and mate with each other,

2560
02:17:43.451 --> 02:17:46.450
for lack of a better word.
And they will find these tombs where the,

2561
02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:50.590
the husband is of Mongol type,
you know,
full of tattoos and everything.

2562
02:17:50.710 --> 02:17:53.380
But the wife looks Swedish because the,
these,

2563
02:17:53.410 --> 02:17:56.020
these tribes all had so many different ethnicities.
And it,

2564
02:17:56.021 --> 02:17:59.950
so by the time you get,
you know,
the early Turks are blonde hair and green eyes,

2565
02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:03.670
but maybe half Turkish sort of olive colored skin,
right?

2566
02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:07.660
So that after a lot of mixing,
they start to get a little bit more formed.

2567
02:18:07.661 --> 02:18:10.090
Like most of the Mongols either looked Asian or Turkish,

2568
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:13.720
but you still have these DNA genes where every now and then you get your blonde

2569
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:16.900
hair or your green eyes or your red hair mixed with Asian features.

2570
02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.500
And it's one of the things I love about him is that you have these types that

2571
02:18:20.501 --> 02:18:25.120
you don't expect to see mixing blonde hair with Asian features and just some of

2572
02:18:25.121 --> 02:18:26.860
the most wild that there's a famous picture,

2573
02:18:26.861 --> 02:18:29.530
and you've probably seen it on the cover of National Geographic.

2574
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:34.300
It has an Afghan girl who's got the brightest,
greenest eyes you've ever seen,

2575
02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:38.080
but that's one of those ones.
But Afghan features in a dark hair,
dark skin.

2576
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:41.860
But that's one of those wonderful mixes you'd get with the step people where you

2577
02:18:41.861 --> 02:18:42.400
go.

2578
02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.370
I never thought those kinds of people mixed together in large groups where you

2579
02:18:45.371 --> 02:18:47.530
would see all these different types in one tribe.

2580
02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:50.950
But you did most of the Mongols were probably Turkish.

2581
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.460
<v 0>That's fascinating.
And wasn't there recently,
um,</v>

2582
02:18:53.510 --> 02:18:57.900
a discovery of Europeans that they couldn't explain it and we'll China and,

2583
02:18:57.980 --> 02:19:01.740
<v 4>and,
and the Chinese eight this,
um,
it's,
it's,</v>

2584
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:03.100
it's a mummy in China,

2585
02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:05.350
a woman that's been around since I think the forties or whatever,

2586
02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.180
but she's a white girl basically.

2587
02:19:07.181 --> 02:19:11.230
I mean we would say today it's a white girl found in a tomb on the borders of

2588
02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:14.680
China.
But that's,
these tribes were talking about,
I mean they had,

2589
02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:19.810
they had some called the Woo sun and some called,
uh,

2590
02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.070
um,
the,

2591
02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:26.080
the UCI and these are tribes of people that the Chinese described in the BC era

2592
02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:30.650
as being white skinned because of the Chinese.
That was just one more sign.

2593
02:19:30.651 --> 02:19:34.910
They were weird as hell.
They have this white skin and round eyes.

2594
02:19:34.911 --> 02:19:36.530
It freaked the hell out of the Chinese.
Cause if,

2595
02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:39.770
if regular people look like Chinese people,
what the hell are these?

2596
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:44.390
And they have yellow hair.
And,
and they sit,
described it as cat's eyes.

2597
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:47.360
I mean to them this was wickedly alien stuff.

2598
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:49.220
And today we would look at it and go,
wow,

2599
02:19:49.221 --> 02:19:52.880
that guy looks kind of like he's from Hamburg,
Hamburg.

2600
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:55.220
Did you see this girl frozen in the ice?

2601
02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:55.711
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2602
02:19:55.711 --> 02:20:00.711
they found this really incredibly intact inkind mummy of a woman who froze to

2603
02:20:01.471 --> 02:20:04.980
death while she was sleeping.
And it's,
I think it's 500 years old.

2604
02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:08.230
<v 4>They said it well but,
but,
but I'll go one up on this.
That's rare.</v>

2605
02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:11.200
But the way that they built these tunes on the step,

2606
02:20:11.470 --> 02:20:16.060
they were built so that the first frost would freeze everything in the tomb and

2607
02:20:16.061 --> 02:20:19.150
then they're,
they're found by archeologists today.

2608
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:21.790
Lots of them totally frozen solid.

2609
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:26.350
And they will take and boil water and slowly pour the boy and they will find

2610
02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:30.850
fabric which deteriorates,
that will find wood and they will find skin.

2611
02:20:30.851 --> 02:20:31.750
And that's how we know.

2612
02:20:31.751 --> 02:20:34.450
And there are photographs of what these guys did with tattoos.

2613
02:20:34.690 --> 02:20:37.990
They were the original tattooed people.
And we have their skin to prove it.

2614
02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:40.540
And so when you find these frozen tombs,

2615
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.400
they're all over the place and you can see them.

2616
02:20:42.430 --> 02:20:43.900
They're in what's called Kurgans,

2617
02:20:43.901 --> 02:20:46.870
which are hills that they build on the step because they bury these guys and

2618
02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:50.440
then they pile mounds of dirt just like little mountains on top of them.

2619
02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:54.310
So you can't steal the stuff in the tomb and they're everywhere.

2620
02:20:54.311 --> 02:20:57.340
And they've only,
I mean,
tons of them.
Unexcavated still.

2621
02:20:57.670 --> 02:21:02.620
<v 0>And are the people that live in that region now?
I mean,
have they recovered?</v>

2622
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:03.620
One of the things that you,

2623
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:08.350
you brought up that was really fascinating was Baghdad and about how the

2624
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:11.800
Gaviscon essentially killed everybody in Baghdad.
They,
they,

2625
02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:14.550
they wiped out or took her,
took them,
yeah,

2626
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:17.470
they threw all their writing into the river.

2627
02:21:17.471 --> 02:21:20.290
And that people don't know that the,

2628
02:21:20.291 --> 02:21:23.100
the Islamic empires back then where some of the most,

2629
02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:26.770
<v 4>oh,
Baghdad was maybe,
I mean other than China and you don't,</v>

2630
02:21:26.771 --> 02:21:28.540
it's hard to compare and contrast.
But,

2631
02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:30.610
but I mean the Chinese were very sophisticated,

2632
02:21:30.611 --> 02:21:35.470
but this is a golden age in Islams history and it was centered around Baghdad.

2633
02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:37.480
And when Hello Goo,
one of the,

2634
02:21:37.481 --> 02:21:41.170
one of the grandsons of Genghis Khan takes Baghdad.
He shoots,

2635
02:21:41.171 --> 02:21:43.480
I love this image and you know you've already heard it,
but I mean they,

2636
02:21:43.810 --> 02:21:47.140
they don't have a lot of stuff around like big rocks to shoot.

2637
02:21:47.290 --> 02:21:51.880
So they build the siege engines and they just stuffed palm trees in them and

2638
02:21:51.881 --> 02:21:56.410
shoot the palm trees over the wall and they're just taken out people on the

2639
02:21:56.411 --> 02:21:59.060
streets of Baghdad with these palm trees coming over the wall.

2640
02:21:59.061 --> 02:22:02.020
And the Mongols were intense.
How insane is that?

2641
02:22:02.021 --> 02:22:06.060
They just fucking fondom with trees.
Any trees.

2642
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:10.730
<v 0>They killed everyone in Baghdad or took everyone as slaves or did whatever the</v>

2643
02:22:10.731 --> 02:22:13.650
fuck they wanted to do with them.
They literally,
the,

2644
02:22:13.710 --> 02:22:16.430
they were saying that you were saying that the river was,
it's black

2645
02:22:16.430 --> 02:22:20.360
<v 4>with the original sources that either either redwood blood sometimes are black</v>

2646
02:22:20.361 --> 02:22:21.194
with the ink of,

2647
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:26.070
of of hundreds and hundreds of years of Islamic civilized writing and

2648
02:22:26.071 --> 02:22:29.850
everything.
And to the,
to the people who wrote about this,
the Muslim chroniclers,

2649
02:22:29.851 --> 02:22:32.430
this is the tragedy of tragedies and,

2650
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:35.350
and they absolutely exaggerate the number of dead.
I mean,

2651
02:22:35.351 --> 02:22:38.040
you'll read numbers where they say the Mongols killed 2 million people.

2652
02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:42.610
All that's a joke.
But they killed enough so that it was astounding.
And,

2653
02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:45.060
and to the people there,
he listen,

2654
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:49.630
that's a nuclear bomb going off by muscle power.
I mean a,

2655
02:22:49.631 --> 02:22:53.210
a Gwynne Dyer wrote a great book once and did a PBS series to go with a called

2656
02:22:53.211 --> 02:22:56.630
war where he talked about the Assyrians doing this and he said they destroyed

2657
02:22:56.631 --> 02:23:00.450
Babylon as fully as had been done with an atomic bomb.

2658
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.210
They just did it with muscle power and lots of people.

2659
02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:07.290
And that's what the Mongols did to Baghdad.
And he rain.
And believe me,

2660
02:23:07.350 --> 02:23:11.430
it sent a message to all the other cities because had Baghdad simply
surrendered,

2661
02:23:11.730 --> 02:23:14.430
none of that would have happened.
And so the other cities were going,

2662
02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:17.040
I think I'll surrender.
You know?
I mean,
that's kind of how that goes.

2663
02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:21.570
And that was the most advanced city in that area,
in that area.

2664
02:23:21.571 --> 02:23:25.140
Absolutely.
To this day,
much more advanced than any place in Europe at that time.

2665
02:23:25.170 --> 02:23:28.170
Could it be argued that they never really recovered?
Yes.

2666
02:23:28.171 --> 02:23:32.430
It could be argued crazy.
Yeah,
1200 yeah,

2667
02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:36.690
1212 1240 right around there.
And it still hasn't recovered now.

2668
02:23:36.691 --> 02:23:41.190
And certainly the population levels I was told only came back during the time of

2669
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:45.230
Saddam Hussein and,
and,
and,
and that's,
and so when people say things like,
well,

2670
02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:48.090
the Mongols spread civilization,
they absolutely did.

2671
02:23:48.450 --> 02:23:52.860
But let's remember the bill that was paid for the benefits that we got.

2672
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:58.020
Think of that 700 years,
700 years of just,

2673
02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:01.140
because there's people out there probably saying,
let's be fair.

2674
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:03.510
Part of the damage was that the Mongols,
you know,

2675
02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:05.070
to live in that part of the world,
right?

2676
02:24:05.071 --> 02:24:07.740
You have to have increased incredible irrigation systems.

2677
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:11.430
And some of these irrigation systems were a thousand years old,
right.

2678
02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:13.890
And they just kept the ancient times.
They just rebuilt these things.

2679
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:18.870
The Mongols either killed and destroyed all the people that kept that stuff up

2680
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:22.590
or depopulated the whole area so that they fell apart.

2681
02:24:22.591 --> 02:24:25.200
So that if the Mongols didn't kill those people themselves,

2682
02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:29.130
by destroying the systems that kept those people alive,

2683
02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:33.030
they often get credited with deep populating those areas because all of a sudden

2684
02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:35.670
there's no water anymore.
The Mongols allowed,
you know,

2685
02:24:35.671 --> 02:24:38.820
the water systems to dry up to a point where now no one can live there.

2686
02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:42.450
So I mean that's,
that's part of how these numbers get so huge too.

2687
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:47.750
It's just insane to think of how many people were killed by the most manual

2688
02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:49.164
methods.

2689
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:53.500
No muscle power muscle does the injection of metal into the human eye.

2690
02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:56.430
If there's a whole book called from sooner to Rome where these military

2691
02:24:56.431 --> 02:25:01.020
historians are basically writing books about the amount of muscle power that it

2692
02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:04.290
took to kill people and on individual levels,
and then,
you know,

2693
02:25:04.291 --> 02:25:07.650
doing math to multiply,
you know how I mean,
it's the,
the,

2694
02:25:07.651 --> 02:25:09.990
the numbers and the figures are incredible.

2695
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:14.610
But the sophistication of early armies is something that's always fascinated me

2696
02:25:14.611 --> 02:25:16.470
because we consistently downplay it.

2697
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:20.160
When you think about this today without computers,
without iPads,

2698
02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:25.280
without even sophisticated calculators trying to put together 30,000 men

2699
02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:30.370
organized as an army and feed them and water them across deserts and all this

2700
02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:32.260
without any of our modern stuff,

2701
02:25:32.261 --> 02:25:34.360
we wouldn't even know how to do it today if you said do it,

2702
02:25:34.361 --> 02:25:35.590
but you can't use your computers.

2703
02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.780
<v 0>And it was amazing how they would set up these points where like they would</v>

2704
02:25:40.410 --> 02:25:44.640
funnel armies into areas and then they'd have like burning pots that would

2705
02:25:44.641 --> 02:25:48.600
obscure the vision so that people would run into this area where they were being

2706
02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:52.800
funneled into a kill zone.
And then when they got there,
that's fucking smoking.

2707
02:25:52.801 --> 02:25:54.830
Pot's and arrows are flying from the mouth.

2708
02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:56.760
<v 4>Guys.
They'd send guys ahead of,</v>

2709
02:25:56.910 --> 02:25:59.910
they'd send guys to go to these towns and scream and yell.

2710
02:25:59.911 --> 02:26:02.340
The Mongols are coming.
Oh my God,
you don't even know what they did.

2711
02:26:02.341 --> 02:26:05.250
And these are Hmong goals working for Genghis Khan who did that.
You know,

2712
02:26:05.251 --> 02:26:08.370
you can't believe what they did to this other city and spreading the rumors so

2713
02:26:08.371 --> 02:26:09.690
that by the time the Mongols got there,

2714
02:26:09.691 --> 02:26:11.970
these people were shivering in their boots.
You know,

2715
02:26:11.971 --> 02:26:14.520
they were just scared to death.
And so when he say something like,
listen,

2716
02:26:14.850 --> 02:26:17.910
I'm very tolerant of all religions,
I won't,
you know,
just,

2717
02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:21.270
just surrender and become part of them and it'll be great.
A lot of these places,

2718
02:26:21.271 --> 02:26:22.410
I mean,
truthfully you can argue,

2719
02:26:22.411 --> 02:26:26.070
and I bet Genghis Khan where he here today would argue that he saved a lot of

2720
02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:29.750
lives.
This is the same attitude with the atomic bomb.
Yes,
I destroyed Baghdad,

2721
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:32.010
but it kept me from having to destroy 500 other cities.

2722
02:26:32.011 --> 02:26:36.090
What would the body count?
B then c,
Genghis Khan was a George Washington.

2723
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:41.610
<v 0>It's such a fascinating glimpse at our recent past and it's not real human</v>

2724
02:26:41.611 --> 02:26:44.320
nature,
right?
We're back to human nature again with Jenkins.

2725
02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:48.380
<v 4>Han evolve today.
If he just had the internet to hell and some Google glass,</v>

2726
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:53.060
<v 0>it'd be playing starcraft.
They,
he totally,
he never get out of his room.</v>

2727
02:26:53.061 --> 02:26:56.720
He had Darby crash and wouldn't be able to live like that.

2728
02:26:56.721 --> 02:27:00.910
Ideally today.
Someone would get you before you ever got that far.

2729
02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.940
Byzantines yeah.
Well it's also like a new army emerging,

2730
02:27:04.941 --> 02:27:09.941
like the United States is trying to lock down as much of that as is humanly

2731
02:27:10.131 --> 02:27:12.620
possible.
That's one thing that you have to

2732
02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.780
<v 4>meetings with him.
I've heard him talk about this a little bit.
Oh yeah.</v>

2733
02:27:17.781 --> 02:27:21.470
General Mattis and at Centcom meetings and where,
and they invited me.
Remember,

2734
02:27:21.471 --> 02:27:23.870
I think I told you this,
I thought I was going to get dumped in the Potomac.

2735
02:27:23.871 --> 02:27:26.630
I thought it was an organized assassination hit on me.

2736
02:27:26.810 --> 02:27:29.840
And the funniest thing about this,
Joe,
you'll,
you'll be able to relate to this,

2737
02:27:29.841 --> 02:27:33.590
is that they invited me because of the podcast,
right?
To this secret.
Not Secret,

2738
02:27:33.591 --> 02:27:35.110
but I'm not supposed to talk about who was there and,

2739
02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:37.850
but they had a list of the invitees and I remember saying to the guy on the

2740
02:27:37.851 --> 02:27:38.121
phone,

2741
02:27:38.121 --> 02:27:40.910
cause I've been to these things as journalists where there's like 200 people and

2742
02:27:40.911 --> 02:27:43.970
we drink wine out of plastic cups.
And you hear some general speaking of podium.

2743
02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:46.790
And I said,
listen man,
I don't have time for that.
It better not be that.
He goes,

2744
02:27:46.791 --> 02:27:48.770
no,
it's you and 11 other guys.
And he goes,

2745
02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.250
you'll recognize the names of most of them.
And I was like,
okay.

2746
02:27:52.251 --> 02:27:56.210
So I get there and everybody gets a printed handout at the Centcom secret

2747
02:27:56.211 --> 02:27:59.300
meeting of who,
of who,
who else was at the meeting and all of these,

2748
02:27:59.301 --> 02:28:01.980
do you have to about this shit should just stop right now.
I can't,

2749
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:05.390
I'll show you a picture later.
Uh,
but,
but I can't,
when I couldn't do,

2750
02:28:05.391 --> 02:28:06.350
I can't tell you who was there,

2751
02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:09.260
but I'm looking at the list of people that everybody's got doctor this from this

2752
02:28:09.261 --> 02:28:11.000
institute bill rights and all these mass.

2753
02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:15.410
And then Mister Dan Carlin podcaster and I thought all these other people have

2754
02:28:15.411 --> 02:28:19.040
to be so pleased to be in a room with me,
you know,
and,
and,

2755
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:22.940
but I was listening to what they're saying and talk and look,

2756
02:28:22.941 --> 02:28:24.320
I already understood a lot of this stuff,

2757
02:28:24.321 --> 02:28:27.290
but to have it confirmed by being in the room with these people talking about,

2758
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:27.771
okay,

2759
02:28:27.771 --> 02:28:31.430
how do we handle this situation if this area of strategic interest is shut down

2760
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:33.260
and you're sitting here going,
okay,

2761
02:28:33.261 --> 02:28:35.900
these guys consider it their job to run the world.

2762
02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:39.920
They're tasked with running the world that if there's any choke points that oil

2763
02:28:39.921 --> 02:28:42.620
goes through,
that's our job to prevent anywhere in the world.

2764
02:28:42.621 --> 02:28:45.500
And you just sit there and go,
how do you dial this back?

2765
02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:49.640
How do you tell these people,
listen,
guess what?
We're not going to police this.

2766
02:28:49.641 --> 02:28:53.570
Persian Gulf choke with the Strait of Hormuz is no longer our responsibility.

2767
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:58.160
They would look at you like you were from Mars.
Yeah.
They were like,

2768
02:28:58.161 --> 02:28:59.600
you're from Mars.
Like you're an idiot.

2769
02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:03.410
You don't know what you're talking about and you're from Mars.
You silly liberal.

2770
02:29:03.430 --> 02:29:04.970
That's it.
You hit these silly,

2771
02:29:04.971 --> 02:29:07.940
silly hippie you think everybody's going to be and everybody's getting evolve

2772
02:29:07.941 --> 02:29:09.240
from the Internet.
Right?
Carlin?

2773
02:29:09.250 --> 02:29:14.250
I see there's a certain amount of pessimistic reality that they have to embrace

2774
02:29:14.530 --> 02:29:17.420
and,
and being in the military at all because you've,
you know,
you've seen it,

2775
02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:19.820
you've been to war.
Like anything else,

2776
02:29:19.821 --> 02:29:23.330
you're in your own bubble where everyone is talking like you are right and

2777
02:29:23.331 --> 02:29:26.810
you're not hearing a lot of,
you know,
hippy talk and,
and so it's a really,

2778
02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:29.510
I mean when you hear something like that,
who is this?
You know,

2779
02:29:29.511 --> 02:29:31.190
if you've been at any of the meetings,
Carlin,

2780
02:29:31.191 --> 02:29:34.640
you would know the threats were really facing and I can't tell you what they
are.

2781
02:29:34.641 --> 02:29:36.470
You just trust me.
This is a bit of a stretch

2782
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:37.281
<v 0>comparison,</v>

2783
02:29:37.281 --> 02:29:41.060
but what Brian was talking about earlier about friends that watch grizzly man

2784
02:29:41.061 --> 02:29:43.950
and don't know that he's gay,
like Comedians,

2785
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:48.140
all of us together like this shit comedians.

2786
02:29:48.141 --> 02:29:51.290
If the people that we hang out with like look at this motherfucker like this is

2787
02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:53.300
immediately going after it,

2788
02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:56.150
those people and laughing about it and thinking it's funny.

2789
02:29:56.151 --> 02:29:59.020
Whereas if we're a group of Mormons,
we wouldn't have the same ones

2790
02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:04.300
<v 4>is that we always there.
They used to do this and then this is,
it's a strategy.</v>

2791
02:30:04.301 --> 02:30:06.340
They used to do it with the Simpsons really early on when they were,

2792
02:30:06.490 --> 02:30:09.250
they pretended like they were writing a show for kids and if you were a kid and

2793
02:30:09.251 --> 02:30:12.400
watching it,
you got it.
But on another level the adults were going,
Whoa,

2794
02:30:12.401 --> 02:30:14.640
I just got that joke where you,
where you're,

2795
02:30:14.641 --> 02:30:18.580
you're doing a show that's tiered and the same show worked for several different

2796
02:30:18.581 --> 02:30:21.940
audiences,
but the,
but the,
the one audience that doesn't understand,
maybe,

2797
02:30:21.941 --> 02:30:24.700
I don't know the show,
so just I'm playing along with you here,
but he's gay,

2798
02:30:24.701 --> 02:30:27.490
he's gay.
Oh,
how funny is this?
But the other audience is going,
oh no,
I love it.

2799
02:30:27.491 --> 02:30:28.810
He's gay.
What do you mean he's gay?

2800
02:30:29.050 --> 02:30:32.740
Know working on a number of different levels for different audiences that only

2801
02:30:32.741 --> 02:30:34.750
get what's what's geared toward their level

2802
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:40.300
<v 0>and amongst these folks to tie together the military people that are running the</v>

2803
02:30:40.580 --> 02:30:42.470
various branches of the military.

2804
02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:44.360
Like the idea of the is not going to be in a war.

2805
02:30:44.361 --> 02:30:47.390
What the fuck are you even talking about?
[inaudible] do you live on?

2806
02:30:47.391 --> 02:30:49.610
We're out there getting shot at every day.

2807
02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:52.190
We're dealing with the IED attacks were in Kandahar this week.

2808
02:30:52.191 --> 02:30:56.300
You don't even know,
Dude.
You want me on that wall?
You need me on that wall.

2809
02:30:56.301 --> 02:30:58.790
You can't handle the truth.
What's the worst thing that's going to happen?

2810
02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:01.580
You lose a little Dick pics on the Internet.
You know?

2811
02:31:01.610 --> 02:31:06.040
That's the type of shit the NSA spying on you.
What do you got to hide and bitch?

2812
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:10.070
Okay.
Do you realize how protective people,
Jesus Christ,

2813
02:31:10.071 --> 02:31:11.400
some gorilla [inaudible].

2814
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:16.260
You can't handle a row buying grass fed grass fed show at this point.
You don't.

2815
02:31:16.261 --> 02:31:19.770
You want to Genghis Khan coming out.
You know that we're keeping that.
Yeah,
they,

2816
02:31:19.771 --> 02:31:21.330
I mean there is that argument,
right,

2817
02:31:21.331 --> 02:31:24.850
that this is the best of all the possible evils than if you look at all the,

2818
02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:28.350
the North Korean regime.
You look at it.
Let me tell you how weird I am.

2819
02:31:28.351 --> 02:31:31.440
Here's how,
and this,
I hope this is what people like about the political show.

2820
02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:35.670
I can see that.
I can understand that.
I'm not so,
you know,
I think,

2821
02:31:35.671 --> 02:31:38.490
I think part of what's wrong with talk radio is that every host has to say,
no,

2822
02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:40.230
this is,
this is how it really is everybody else's work.

2823
02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:43.920
I can see that and I could be wrong.
Um,
you know,
and I think,

2824
02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:46.770
I think if you factor that into your thinking,
it's important that,
look,

2825
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:50.560
there's a possibility that that's all right.
That's all true.
And,

2826
02:31:50.561 --> 02:31:53.400
and factor that into your thinking when you come up with your own political

2827
02:31:53.401 --> 02:31:57.990
ideas,
put in failsafe idea.
Say,
listen,
I believe it's a pretty strongly,

2828
02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:00.780
but it might be be.
And if it's be,
here's my backup plan.
Well,

2829
02:32:00.781 --> 02:32:05.781
I've had a chance to see a lot of conspiracy theories that I know have no basis.

2830
02:32:07.021 --> 02:32:11.860
In fact,
when it comes to not just the show,
but mixed martial arts.
Yeah.

2831
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.070
Because I do the commentary for the UFC.

2832
02:32:14.071 --> 02:32:19.071
I have seen so many elaborate schemes that people think are in play to make a,

2833
02:32:20.521 --> 02:32:25.050
you know,
a results happen the way she wants them to.
Yeah.
Well,

2834
02:32:25.051 --> 02:32:27.420
I mean I'm sure that stuff has happened before,

2835
02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:32.480
but what I know to be an absolute undeniable fact and then seeing all these

2836
02:32:33.031 --> 02:32:35.850
elaborate conspiracies attributed to these events,

2837
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:39.900
I so I'm aware as an insider,
yes.
So people who are outside,

2838
02:32:39.901 --> 02:32:44.490
and this is obviously very small nuance world,
the world of mixed martial arts,

2839
02:32:44.491 --> 02:32:47.220
but I think that's a trend that's a trend for human beings.

2840
02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:49.740
I think that the indicative too of a lot of other situations,

2841
02:32:49.741 --> 02:32:53.940
and I think that the big picture is probably infinitely complicated.

2842
02:32:53.941 --> 02:32:56.550
It's not as simple as the government doesn't want you to try.

2843
02:32:56.551 --> 02:32:58.530
The government's trying to control you.
That's right.

2844
02:32:58.531 --> 02:33:02.010
There's so much shit going on that it is just trying and they're all holding it

2845
02:33:02.011 --> 02:33:03.390
all together,
each other,

2846
02:33:03.391 --> 02:33:06.750
and yet they're absolutely care coming off each other and they're also dealing

2847
02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:07.680
with this new reality,

2848
02:33:07.681 --> 02:33:10.680
this technological reality and this and that is shaking things up.

2849
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:13.860
Did you see the Michael Hastings video that was released today?
I did not,

2850
02:33:13.861 --> 02:33:15.900
but tell me about it cause I actually am Michael.

2851
02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:18.750
The whole Michael Hastings thing is important to me because I believe there's

2852
02:33:18.751 --> 02:33:22.020
this small group of journalists really doing the job of journalism and Hastings

2853
02:33:22.021 --> 02:33:25.080
was one of them.
So what,
what,
what did I miss the video of the car?

2854
02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:28.560
They got a video of the car from a security camera accelerating down the street

2855
02:33:28.561 --> 02:33:31.980
and then billowing up before it impacts.
No,

2856
02:33:31.981 --> 02:33:36.690
an explosion before the impact.
The car,

2857
02:33:36.691 --> 02:33:41.280
it looks like the car is driving and then there's a boom and then a boom.

2858
02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:44.790
So if you're a second,
if you're a Mercedes Benz right now,

2859
02:33:44.791 --> 02:33:47.880
you just have a reason all of a sudden to find out what really happened to

2860
02:33:47.881 --> 02:33:49.800
Michael Hastings.
So it's not your fault,
it's,

2861
02:33:49.890 --> 02:33:52.830
it's hard to tell what it is because it's not the clearest video in the world.

2862
02:33:52.831 --> 02:33:56.400
And it's black and white.
It's black and white.
It's a security camera.
It's,

2863
02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:01.720
but it's the things hurling down the street and you see this impact and on

2864
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:06.510
impact,
there's a boom.
And then there's a giant,
huge explosion.
Let me,

2865
02:34:06.511 --> 02:34:09.060
let me point this out because this is,
this is truly the way I believe.

2866
02:34:09.061 --> 02:34:11.370
As much as I,
I might go there to some degree.

2867
02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:15.180
I literally can't believe that this guy was killed by the government or anything

2868
02:34:15.181 --> 02:34:17.980
like that.
And if he was,
then I don't even know what to

2869
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:20.790
<v 2>do here.
Let me put it to you this way though.
When I tried to tell myself,</v>

2870
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:23.470
<v 0>Junkee video,
here's the video.</v>

2871
02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:25.390
We're playing it right now for her to see if I can,

2872
02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:30.600
he's going to fly down the street and slam into a pole and there's no breaks.

2873
02:34:31.121 --> 02:34:35.020
Watch this.
Boom,
boom.
See that?

2874
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:40.240
You see there's a boom and then there's a boom and there's a giant explosion and

2875
02:34:40.241 --> 02:34:44.140
they're a distance from each other.
So it's almost like the car blows up as it's

2876
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.870
<v 2>moving.</v>

2877
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:47.670
Here's the part that drives me crazy and I saw a couple cones in that too.

2878
02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:52.650
I used to,
I used ones,
Ufo things that fly.
Where do they call it?
Oh,

2879
02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:57.380
he's helping the case.
Mom,
Brian.
But you know what?
When I was at,
when I was,
uh,

2880
02:34:57.430 --> 02:35:02.400
uh,
here in La in news,
I worked for one of the best news men,

2881
02:35:02.430 --> 02:35:04.440
old dinosaur of a guy.
When I worked for him,

2882
02:35:04.441 --> 02:35:07.860
a guy named John Babcock won a bunch of Peabody awards.
Famous news guy here.

2883
02:35:07.861 --> 02:35:12.630
He taught me how to do news and his general principle was if the LAPD,

2884
02:35:12.890 --> 02:35:16.470
um,
doesn't talk about something,
boom,
we opened an investigation.

2885
02:35:16.471 --> 02:35:18.450
That's all it took.
It did.
We didn't have to know anything more than that.

2886
02:35:18.451 --> 02:35:22.590
They say,
they said,
no comment.
We were on it as a newsperson.

2887
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:27.570
The question I have is why aren't they,
I mean,
look,
if you're a car dash sheen,

2888
02:35:27.571 --> 02:35:29.310
if you're some minor celebrity,
we shouldn't care about,

2889
02:35:29.311 --> 02:35:31.170
we're going to find out every little thing.
You know,
who was the,

2890
02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:35.680
who was the blonde chick that died in Bermuda or whatever?
Uh,
the diner.

2891
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.620
Natalie Holloway.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2892
02:35:37.621 --> 02:35:42.000
The one who was the stripper who married the rich guy?
What was her name?
Oh,

2893
02:35:42.001 --> 02:35:44.640
come on.
A stripper that married a rich,
but I'll come up with it in a second,

2894
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:48.480
in a second.
Uh,
but I mean my point was as if you're some minor celebrity,

2895
02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:51.990
the media is going to uncover every last hour of your life and the whole thing

2896
02:35:52.270 --> 02:35:55.560
it if you're Michael Hastings,
where is the reporter?
Ben?

2897
02:35:55.561 --> 02:35:58.470
Who says here was Michael Hastings last 12 hours.

2898
02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:03.000
Where was he two hours before the crash?
I mean,
you know,
uh,

2899
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:06.760
from what I've heard,
the guy hadn't had a drink in five years.
Um,

2900
02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:11.510
didn't do drugs or anything like that anymore.
Um,
but if,
uh,

2901
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:14.310
oh God,
that girl's name is on the tip of my head.
I don't tip of my tongue.

2902
02:36:14.311 --> 02:36:16.610
I'll come up with it in a second.
Um,
but the point is,

2903
02:36:16.611 --> 02:36:21.611
is that normally you would expect the media to now go run past that guy's last

2904
02:36:22.321 --> 02:36:26.250
12 hours.
Cause that's going to tell you a lot about the situation.
Right?

2905
02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:29.830
No one's done that well,
I think crazy that no one's done it.

2906
02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.780
<v 0>Independent Internet media has,</v>

2907
02:36:31.810 --> 02:36:35.950
I think there's been many stories written on the fact that he was responsible

2908
02:36:35.951 --> 02:36:39.880
for in his articles,
getting generals fired.
No question.
And what was going on.

2909
02:36:39.881 --> 02:36:43.360
A big story.
I'm supposedly on the CIA and I'm betray us.

2910
02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:46.060
And it had something to do with Jill Kelly and had something to do with the

2911
02:36:46.061 --> 02:36:49.000
whole reason why he was fired in the first place,
allegedly.

2912
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:50.980
I don't know the whole details on the story.

2913
02:36:51.090 --> 02:36:55.110
<v 2>He was regularly had his life threatened as as many good investigative reporters</v>

2914
02:36:55.111 --> 02:36:57.780
do.
This could have been anybody.
It could have been just some guy who hated him.

2915
02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:00.690
The other thing to remember that I was starting to get to though is that every

2916
02:37:00.691 --> 02:37:03.450
time I tell myself something like that's impossible from the government

2917
02:37:03.451 --> 02:37:07.110
standpoint,
there's a book called poisoning the press out there.
That's very good.

2918
02:37:07.111 --> 02:37:08.250
And it's about,
uh,

2919
02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:11.340
do you remember Jack Anderson that you've investigative reporter used to be on

2920
02:37:11.341 --> 02:37:16.040
good morning America always had some scoop and a Brit Hume from Fox News used to

2921
02:37:16.041 --> 02:37:17.120
be his assistant.

2922
02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:21.500
Jack Anderson was the deepest in Ames a ham.
I mean,

2923
02:37:21.501 --> 02:37:24.540
he definitely would take these investigative stories and I'm Jack Anderson and

2924
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:27.440
his,
but he uncovered stuff that's,

2925
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:32.370
that messed with people so much.
Um,

2926
02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.600
apparently there was a plan in the Nixon White House,

2927
02:37:35.601 --> 02:37:37.250
and this is on the record documents.

2928
02:37:37.251 --> 02:37:41.930
I mean nobody even debated where they talked about killing Jack Anderson

2929
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:47.720
releasing sensitive information and one of the ideas floated was to do something

2930
02:37:47.721 --> 02:37:48.291
to his car,

2931
02:37:48.291 --> 02:37:52.250
including putting LSD on the steering wheel so it can be absorbed by his hands.

2932
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:57.140
And two guys including g Gordon Liddy,
we're up for this idea and ready to go.

2933
02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:58.670
It was President Nixon that canceled it.

2934
02:37:58.671 --> 02:38:02.360
But I mean that idea got well past the early planning stages.

2935
02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:05.180
And you say to yourself,
okay,
if in 1972,

2936
02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:09.320
the president of the United States is even having people discuss this,

2937
02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.650
that blows my mind.
Forget about talking about Michael Hastings.

2938
02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:15.280
So you sit there and go,
what's possible?
Like I,

2939
02:38:15.310 --> 02:38:16.760
I'm not the kind of guy that can go there.

2940
02:38:16.761 --> 02:38:19.250
I just can't believe that the government would off this guy.

2941
02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:21.590
But there are so many questions and as a reporter,

2942
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:23.570
you're not supposed to go in there and say,
I know what happened.

2943
02:38:23.571 --> 02:38:26.060
Let's see if the government killed him.
You're supposed to say,
all right,

2944
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:29.150
let's see what his last 12 hours look like.
Let's get some toxicology.

2945
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:32.870
Let's start to piece together things.
What,
we have no toxicology right now.

2946
02:38:32.871 --> 02:38:34.960
We have no statement from the LAPD.
Um,

2947
02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:40.180
some reporter in San Diego said that his body was returned in an urn without the

2948
02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:44.440
family's permission to cremate them.
I've heard that's not true.
Um,

2949
02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:47.940
I actually direct message that woman on Twitter,
that reporter,

2950
02:38:47.941 --> 02:38:50.270
and she didn't answer me back.
So I don't know what's true about that.

2951
02:38:50.271 --> 02:38:54.150
But the point you're trying to get some,
anyway,
the point of the matter is,

2952
02:38:54.151 --> 02:38:56.180
is that something's going on here.
And as a reporter,

2953
02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:58.850
you're supposed to go out there and begin to look into it.

2954
02:38:58.970 --> 02:39:03.290
What bothers me is that no one is,
I don't understand that because you know why?

2955
02:39:03.291 --> 02:39:06.740
Cause it's a salacious,
juicy story about a famous person.

2956
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.890
It has all of the things that even if this wasn't,
you know,

2957
02:39:09.891 --> 02:39:11.510
a conspiratorial type story,

2958
02:39:11.810 --> 02:39:16.330
you would expect the media to be on just cause it's a conspiratorial story too.

2959
02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:20.270
Wouldn't you think that these people would be terrified to mean to journalists?

2960
02:39:20.271 --> 02:39:23.030
Fellow journalists,
it's just today,
five hours ago,

2961
02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:27.530
are now suing the FBI because the FBI I think had like 20 days to release the

2962
02:39:27.531 --> 02:39:31.190
information that they have on Michael Hastings and they didn't.

2963
02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:34.820
So they went over the time periods and now these two independent reporters or

2964
02:39:34.821 --> 02:39:38.210
the two guys next to be shot and murdered,
what are their names?
Uh,

2965
02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.250
Jason Leopold and Ryan Shapiro.
I don't know those guys.

2966
02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:48.140
And these guys are suing for the Freedom of Information Act?
Yeah.

2967
02:39:48.930 --> 02:39:53.710
Oh Wow.
Some supposedly,
um,
uh,

2968
02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.170
Hastings,
his lawyer has all this information from what he was working on.

2969
02:39:57.171 --> 02:39:59.040
How'd you like to be Hastings lawyer right now?

2970
02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.160
Supposedly his girlfriend or his wife,

2971
02:40:01.161 --> 02:40:04.490
whichever the case is working on completing the book,

2972
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:07.880
completing whatever he's working on.
Well,
again,

2973
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:10.250
I don't like to be mister conspiracy theory.

2974
02:40:10.251 --> 02:40:14.070
What bothers me is that when reporters don't do their job,
like look into this

2975
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.130
<v 3>guy's last 12 hours,
I think it opens the door up.</v>

2976
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:20.160
I mean people are naturally now going to speculate and you're going to get these

2977
02:40:20.161 --> 02:40:22.980
wild theories about,
you know,
Michael Hastings and the Grassy Knoll,

2978
02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.550
which you don't have to have if the reporters can begin to debunk this.

2979
02:40:26.730 --> 02:40:30.060
The second thing that happens though is did you see wolf blitzer was hosting

2980
02:40:30.061 --> 02:40:31.900
some thing the other day with with,
you know,

2981
02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.040
the generals and I mean he looked like he was working for the government and you

2982
02:40:35.041 --> 02:40:35.791
just turn around and go,
okay,

2983
02:40:35.791 --> 02:40:40.350
the next question is do I trust journalists in air quotes like that to be

2984
02:40:40.351 --> 02:40:42.780
investigating something that,
so once they lose their credibility,

2985
02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:44.490
I've got to get some,
you know,

2986
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.570
Matt Taibbi or some other guy who's a lot like Hastings to investigate him or

2987
02:40:48.571 --> 02:40:49.500
I'm not going to buy it.

2988
02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:53.080
I don't believe that you can consider wolf blitzer to be a journalist anymore.

2989
02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:55.200
I think he never,

2990
02:40:55.350 --> 02:40:59.340
this is the talking head that CNN keeps employing Wolf Blitzer.

2991
02:40:59.341 --> 02:41:03.360
Forget the journalist part.
How about he's just awful and there's nothing.

2992
02:41:03.361 --> 02:41:04.710
You could just see the video,

2993
02:41:04.711 --> 02:41:08.970
the really awkward video of the woman and asked her about God's saving her from

2994
02:41:08.971 --> 02:41:09.451
the hurricane.

2995
02:41:09.451 --> 02:41:14.451
She said she was an atheist and so Doug Stan hope organize donations for her

2996
02:41:15.331 --> 02:41:18.060
because she said she was an aide.
I've said before,
and I'll say it again,

2997
02:41:18.090 --> 02:41:20.610
and this is not an arrogant thing to say,
and I'll explain why in a second.

2998
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:23.700
I could double CNNS ratings.
I could just give me CNN.

2999
02:41:23.701 --> 02:41:26.220
I will double their ratings in like 48 hours.

3000
02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:29.730
But the only reason I can do that is because they are so awful that,
you know,

3001
02:41:29.731 --> 02:41:33.600
the bar is so low that I could fire a few people there and their ratings would

3002
02:41:33.601 --> 02:41:35.820
double,
you know,
just be,
oh,
we'll put yours fired.

3003
02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:38.310
I think I'll turn CNN on again and see what's going on.
You know,

3004
02:41:38.370 --> 02:41:40.200
very important though,
um,

3005
02:41:40.470 --> 02:41:43.470
for CNN to have people that are willing to follow their agenda,

3006
02:41:43.530 --> 02:41:45.820
whatever the new Lee,
you're absolutely correct.

3007
02:41:45.821 --> 02:41:49.440
They're interested in getting these hard hitting.
No,
no.
You know how you know,

3008
02:41:49.441 --> 02:41:52.200
because they've cut their investigative budget down to nothing.
Well,

3009
02:41:52.201 --> 02:41:56.040
we had amber Lyon in who used to work for CNN and talked about her coverage of

3010
02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:56.950
Bahrain.
Yeah.

3011
02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:01.440
She says she did the special that they were in there exactly on CNN internet and

3012
02:42:01.441 --> 02:42:05.040
it was because they wanted to be able to park their military there in case some

3013
02:42:05.041 --> 02:42:06.230
shit went down with Iran.

3014
02:42:06.231 --> 02:42:09.420
So they wanted it to like sort of squash all this descent and all this.

3015
02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:13.170
So they essentially put together what was like a tourism piece.
But this is how,

3016
02:42:13.171 --> 02:42:16.680
and this takes us right to Snowden because this is where the government has

3017
02:42:16.681 --> 02:42:17.550
managed and they,

3018
02:42:17.551 --> 02:42:20.520
and this has been going on a lot longer than we think because they used to say

3019
02:42:20.521 --> 02:42:23.640
in the fifties and sixties that the CIA has a person in every newsroom in

3020
02:42:23.641 --> 02:42:26.250
America.
So this has been something that's been going on for a while.

3021
02:42:26.251 --> 02:42:30.180
But in the 70s they were breaking lots of stories that the intelligence agencies

3022
02:42:30.181 --> 02:42:33.390
did not like.
And as a Newsperson,
that's how you know,

3023
02:42:33.391 --> 02:42:36.960
news is working when the government and the intelligence agencies and all these

3024
02:42:36.961 --> 02:42:40.050
people that classify stuff are mad as hell at the news media.

3025
02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:41.730
The news media is doing its job.

3026
02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:45.030
When the news media is defending those agencies and not releasing the

3027
02:42:45.031 --> 02:42:48.510
information.
That's when you throw up your hands and go and and going after.

3028
02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:49.350
I mean,
when listen,

3029
02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:51.900
there are people that don't like Glenn Greenwald's personality.

3030
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:54.210
They don't like a lot about him.
They think he's a grandstander.

3031
02:42:54.211 --> 02:42:55.044
All these kinds of things.

3032
02:42:55.050 --> 02:42:59.400
But what Glenn Greenwald did is what reporters are supposed to do and when you

3033
02:42:59.401 --> 02:43:02.910
watch reporters Slam Glenn Greenwald or Michael Hastings,

3034
02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:08.190
he took such crap from other reporters because he reported stuff that they

3035
02:43:08.191 --> 02:43:11.830
wouldn't report because they didn't want to burn a source.
That's when you go,

3036
02:43:11.831 --> 02:43:14.560
wait a minute.
You're priorities are totally screwed up.

3037
02:43:14.561 --> 02:43:17.560
If you're worried about telling the American people important things because

3038
02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:21.070
your source might not talk to you anymore.
You know the Breitbart story,

3039
02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:25.330
I don't like it.
And conspiracy guys who aren't reporters.
I mean,
that's right.

3040
02:43:25.331 --> 02:43:27.820
He wasn't a reporting that drives me nuts drive.

3041
02:43:27.821 --> 02:43:31.600
What's weird about the story is that the guy has a heart attack and then his

3042
02:43:31.601 --> 02:43:33.700
corner gets poisoned.

3043
02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:37.480
The guys corners poisoned or did he die?

3044
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:42.010
What happens is poison territorial.
The guys are,
but,

3045
02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:46.620
but listen right away to your reaction,
which is fascinating.
We,

3046
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:50.260
you're talking about a guy who has may be releasing very sensitive information

3047
02:43:50.261 --> 02:43:52.040
about very powerful people and you're like,
wow,

3048
02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:57.010
but it's a natural inclination.
I'm not,
I'm not saying you're incorrect.

3049
02:43:57.070 --> 02:44:00.340
I think a good reporter and not that I am,
but I can see when when I,
I didn't,

3050
02:44:00.341 --> 02:44:02.380
I know him when I see him.
I'm a good reporter,

3051
02:44:02.381 --> 02:44:05.740
is supposed to be a little skeptical,
but still follow the leads.

3052
02:44:05.741 --> 02:44:08.890
You don't want to report this as I bet John F.
Kennedy wasn't killed by Oswald.

3053
02:44:08.891 --> 02:44:11.530
Let's go and look in that.
You want a guy who says,
okay,
there are some questions.

3054
02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:14.770
I'm going to follow the trail of evidence and see where it leads me,

3055
02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:18.160
and a good healthy skepticism is good for a reporter on both sides.

3056
02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:21.010
You don't want to take anybody's word for anything.
At the same time,

3057
02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.220
you don't want to be a nut.
He don't want to go off into fantasy land.

3058
02:44:24.250 --> 02:44:27.320
Dead from arsenic is coroner was killed from Arsenal.
Okay,

3059
02:44:27.321 --> 02:44:29.590
well that is a little warrior.
The fuck man.

3060
02:44:30.050 --> 02:44:34.390
The two months after Breitbart's passing the corner that investigated the cause

3061
02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:38.020
of death.
Are you on a part time site arsenic?
No,
this is um,

3062
02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:42.400
this is our t r t.com.
Bullshit.
No,

3063
02:44:42.430 --> 02:44:45.550
they're just not totally,
I mean our tea will play,

3064
02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:47.230
play some stories that are good and real,

3065
02:44:47.231 --> 02:44:49.480
but they'll also play some stuff where you go,
Oh God,
don't do that.

3066
02:44:49.481 --> 02:44:52.830
You're ruining what little credibility.
But it's uh,
yeah,
our tea there.

3067
02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:56.700
They'd sketch no little bits,
little bits,
little bits,
sketch.

3068
02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:00.070
Sometimes we have Abby Martin August 5th they have,

3069
02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:02.920
they have some good and you know what?
I feel like they're in the process.

3070
02:45:02.921 --> 02:45:07.690
Just like Al Jazeera was of moving from sketch to not so sketch anymore.

3071
02:45:07.691 --> 02:45:12.550
It's an evolution.
Um,
so,
so it depends.
Huh?
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

3072
02:45:12.551 --> 02:45:14.170
It's interesting trying to be more credible.

3073
02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.820
Some of the hard hitting stories are coming from Russian times and again though,

3074
02:45:18.821 --> 02:45:22.960
because the stupid American media is leaving the door wide open if they were

3075
02:45:22.961 --> 02:45:25.210
doing real journalistic.
It's a little like saying,
you know,

3076
02:45:25.211 --> 02:45:26.710
when the football players went on strike in,

3077
02:45:26.711 --> 02:45:29.500
the NFL goes on strike and all of a sudden you're watching guys who couldn't

3078
02:45:29.501 --> 02:45:32.530
play in the NFL where we're going at resumes.
But that's all you have.
That's,

3079
02:45:32.531 --> 02:45:35.470
that's the analogy is that all of a sudden the NFL is on strike or not.

3080
02:45:35.471 --> 02:45:37.690
We're doing the job.
So we're watching football players to go,
hey,

3081
02:45:37.691 --> 02:45:38.830
he's a pretty good running back.

3082
02:45:38.831 --> 02:45:41.590
That's because he's not up against Eric Dickerson.
If it doesn't,

3083
02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:44.650
you don't have anything to compare it to.
So our media is not doing its job.

3084
02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:48.190
So when anybody looks like they're even kind of doing the job of real
journalism,

3085
02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:49.630
it looks great by comparison.

3086
02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:53.140
That's a very interesting analogy and that's a mixed martial arts analogy as

3087
02:45:53.141 --> 02:45:54.550
well as lower organisations.

3088
02:45:54.551 --> 02:45:59.420
When fighters look spectacular and they find the UFC or that way,
you know,

3089
02:45:59.470 --> 02:46:03.030
this guy looks great,
but who is he fought?
You know?
Yeah,
exactly.
Um,

3090
02:46:03.210 --> 02:46:06.430
I think that's a,
that's a really good point.
It's a really interesting point.

3091
02:46:06.730 --> 02:46:10.150
It's a,
the whole thing.
It's very strange,
man.
We,

3092
02:46:10.170 --> 02:46:12.200
we live in one of the weirdest times to be alive.

3093
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:15.000
But I guess that's always been the case.
People have always lived in the words.

3094
02:46:15.001 --> 02:46:16.550
Yes,
that's a good,
and you know what,

3095
02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:20.030
that's what I try to remember is that the way we in general,

3096
02:46:20.031 --> 02:46:24.590
on a cellular level feel is the way it's always been when you kind of go,
God,

3097
02:46:24.591 --> 02:46:26.960
this is really strange.
What's that old Chinese proverb?

3098
02:46:26.961 --> 02:46:30.500
May you live in interesting times.
Right?
It's a double edge sword.
Exactly.

3099
02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.360
And that's always been the case.
And you know,

3100
02:46:32.361 --> 02:46:36.020
some Roman was going does Germans are so weird,
man,
we got,

3101
02:46:36.050 --> 02:46:37.580
it's a strange time to be alive.

3102
02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:42.230
And when you see things like this Hastings thing and with your deep knowledge of

3103
02:46:42.231 --> 02:46:45.410
history and all the crazy shit that people have done from didn't,

3104
02:46:45.411 --> 02:46:47.150
the cons didn't,
didn't,
uh,

3105
02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:52.160
one of the fucking son's get poisoned when a gang is [inaudible] son who might

3106
02:46:52.671 --> 02:46:55.430
not have really been his son.
Didn't they kill them how they think?

3107
02:46:55.431 --> 02:46:56.420
So they don't know.
Again,

3108
02:46:56.810 --> 02:47:00.200
the bungles weren't exactly keeping scrupulous records about these things.

3109
02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:05.240
But what's really shocking to us is that in this day and age,

3110
02:47:05.270 --> 02:47:09.080
I mean if,
let's just go on a big fucking crazy tinfoil hat limb,

3111
02:47:09.410 --> 02:47:14.360
if they did kill my Michael Hastings,
it's amazing that they can still do that.

3112
02:47:14.361 --> 02:47:15.950
Like they get busted for cheating.

3113
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:19.340
Like they get busted for having an affair with some chick is threatening some

3114
02:47:19.341 --> 02:47:22.910
other chick,
you know,
and then the FBI is actually going to have to the CIA.

3115
02:47:22.911 --> 02:47:25.730
There's all this exchange of information that to me that someone can still do

3116
02:47:25.731 --> 02:47:27.080
that the most interesting.
You know,

3117
02:47:27.081 --> 02:47:29.750
when you talk about history and what could be the weirdest thing that happened,

3118
02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:34.520
if that information became confirmed and we knew for a fact,

3119
02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:37.460
let's pretend what happens is somehow it comes and we know the government killed

3120
02:47:37.461 --> 02:47:38.294
Michael Hastings.

3121
02:47:38.810 --> 02:47:43.810
The reality changes like in a nine 11 108 all of a sudden all bets are off.

3122
02:47:46.250 --> 02:47:50.510
Absolutely everything.
We weren't that statement.
This in quotes,
the government,

3123
02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:55.850
is it the government or is it a small group of people with military that stand

3124
02:47:55.851 --> 02:48:00.830
to the to like really be damaged by one of his stories that that's the door that

3125
02:48:00.831 --> 02:48:04.160
gets opened.
Right.
If this happens then everything,
then you go,
okay,

3126
02:48:04.161 --> 02:48:05.510
the president has to comment,

3127
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:09.710
the congress has to comment the investigation and then then the big war starts

3128
02:48:09.711 --> 02:48:13.280
between information versus no information versus we'd have national security.

3129
02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:14.270
Michael you,

3130
02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:17.600
if you knew what we knew about what Michael Hastings was about to report you to

3131
02:48:17.601 --> 02:48:22.070
kill them yourself.
I mean it's going to get to be that kind of thing,
but again,

3132
02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:25.300
I'm not little Asterik I just can't see that but,

3133
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:29.510
but if it happened it would change everything.
Yeah,
it would.

3134
02:48:29.511 --> 02:48:32.060
It would be like finding out that John F.
Kennedy was killed.

3135
02:48:32.061 --> 02:48:33.350
Here's the gunman's name,
he was,

3136
02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:36.320
he was hired by the Johnson in minister or whatever.

3137
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:40.160
The world change and that's why the conspiracy nuts in the Kennedy thing,

3138
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:42.740
they can't give that up cause like Oliver Stone,
his whole,

3139
02:48:42.741 --> 02:48:45.710
a lot of his world views based on the idea that that is what happened.

3140
02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:48.350
Therefore this government is the government that did that.
You know,

3141
02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:50.090
a whole bunch of dominoes start falling.

3142
02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:53.330
If you find out something in the government with official sanction killed

3143
02:48:53.331 --> 02:48:58.040
Michael Hastings,
the world is different and everybody would have to respect,

3144
02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:59.750
people would have to start answering questions.

3145
02:48:59.751 --> 02:49:00.830
We would have to start discussing it.

3146
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:03.960
Wolf Blitzer might have to mention it on the news.
It's not going to mention,

3147
02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:06.320
I know he's not going to mention he's going to dance around it one way or

3148
02:49:06.321 --> 02:49:08.040
another.
Don't think we should have killed me.
It

3149
02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:10.500
<v 0>isn't the Michael Hastings thing.
A Boon for society.
Don't you think?</v>

3150
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:13.470
Shouldn't he have been killed?
You need to be killed sooner.
We'll take a poll.

3151
02:49:13.471 --> 02:49:17.160
CNN poll says you can't be killed two years ago before.
Well listen to her.

3152
02:49:17.161 --> 02:49:21.680
Very interesting.
CNN polls.
Geraldo Rivera said did.
Yeah.
Those,

3153
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:23.280
I feel very sorry for Michael Hastings family,

3154
02:49:23.281 --> 02:49:25.980
but let's not forget he took down our greatest fighting general.

3155
02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:29.910
They really say that.
Oh my God,
he repeated it.
Yes.
Well,

3156
02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:33.270
while we're talking about people who aren't really journalists so well,

3157
02:49:33.271 --> 02:49:37.590
he used to be number that he was the reason why the,
I never went there.

3158
02:49:37.591 --> 02:49:41.040
Now do you know that he was the reason why there's a prude or film was released?

3159
02:49:41.310 --> 02:49:44.850
Maybe proof of film was released on the Geraldo Rivera Rivera show with Dick

3160
02:49:44.850 --> 02:49:48.780
Gregory in the 1970s I think it was.
That was a new version of it.

3161
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:52.740
I don't know cause I was thinking [inaudible] show in the 1970 [inaudible] he

3162
02:49:52.741 --> 02:49:56.250
did.
He did.
He did.
I'll take your word for it.
I was watching the monkeys.

3163
02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:00.030
I've watched the video watch the video of the shows.

3164
02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:02.550
I thought they just had a different angle.

3165
02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:04.470
They showed it for the first time on television.

3166
02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:07.560
People got a chance to see what was really what really happened and get to see

3167
02:50:07.561 --> 02:50:11.790
the,
I will not,
I will not eat bait theorist.
We'll play,
we'll play and we'll,

3168
02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:15.060
and I believe you will end with Geraldo,
uh,

3169
02:50:15.270 --> 02:50:19.560
with Dick Gregory on his show showing the Zapruder film because it's fascinating

3170
02:50:19.561 --> 02:50:23.250
because it's also a time machine,
uh,
into,
uh,
into the past.

3171
02:50:23.251 --> 02:50:27.430
But before we end with this hardcore history,
you got it.
If you,

3172
02:50:27.431 --> 02:50:30.770
if you don't have this on your iPod or your phone,

3173
02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.100
your android go get that shit.
The lady show is not really representative.

3174
02:50:35.101 --> 02:50:37.920
We did some different things but just yet listened to a couple if he can't stand

3175
02:50:37.921 --> 02:50:40.320
the one you listened to listen to and that's Dan Carlin's a bad motherfucker and

3176
02:50:40.321 --> 02:50:43.950
he made history interesting to me.
So that's,
you just are a mangled,

3177
02:50:43.970 --> 02:50:47.850
I'm a Mongo fan but I'm also Martin Luther Fan.
I'm a fan of that episode.

3178
02:50:47.851 --> 02:50:50.640
I'm a fan of,
uh,
was it Thor's angels,

3179
02:50:50.641 --> 02:50:54.390
angels listening to Right Hannity and then violence too.

3180
02:50:54.450 --> 02:50:58.890
You got some amazing shit and go.
They really are.
I'm going to listen to it.

3181
02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:02.380
They really are.
And like audio books are like long tail there.

3182
02:51:02.381 --> 02:51:04.410
They're just fantastic.
Really great stuff.

3183
02:51:04.411 --> 02:51:09.240
So folks go subscribe to that Shit guys.
Follow him on Twitter.
Thank you man.

3184
02:51:09.290 --> 02:51:12.600
You've made a huge difference in our numbers too and your audience has been so

3185
02:51:12.601 --> 02:51:13.141
cool.

3186
02:51:13.141 --> 02:51:16.380
And I mean I can't thank you enough and I don't think you enough but and guys

3187
02:51:16.410 --> 02:51:20.470

Well hold on a second before we go though the you,

3188
02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:24.540
but I found out I should thank my audience cause I found your audience contacted

3189
02:51:24.541 --> 02:51:28.570
me saying listen,
it was a Yiddish hookup,
wasn't it like a shit up.

3190
02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:32.940
We have each other for sure.
You've made even enlightened me about history.

3191
02:51:32.941 --> 02:51:37.020
It's very entertained me and the reason why people are enjoying it so much,

3192
02:51:37.021 --> 02:51:39.570
it's not just because I'm talking about it,
it's because it's awesome.

3193
02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:42.450
You mentioned it all the time.
So we're grateful.

3205
02:52:15.500 --> 02:52:20.500
You briefly talked about history by plan to come back.

3206

3218

It's a joke to joke.

3219
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:10.230
It's an inside joke that used to be the fleshlight thing might be stoned.
No,

3220
02:53:10.330 --> 02:53:14.700
I didn't stupid.
It was a joke.
That's why I looked at you.
Okay.

3221
02:53:14.890 --> 02:53:19.750
This is a Dick Gregory on the Geraldo Rivera show from 1973 is that what it is?

3222
02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:25.000
75 75 1975 and then my buddy,
we'll see you tomorrow with Matt Farah.

3223

Matt Farah from the smoking tire.com auto journalist.
Cool cat.
We're going to,

3224
02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:33.280
we're going to talk gear head shit and then we're going to try to do Tony

3225
02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:34.420
Hinchcliffe this week too.
If he's around.

3226
02:53:34.421 --> 02:53:37.570
I know Tony's got a new show that he's doing with you,
right?
We'll do that.

3227
02:53:39.250 --> 02:53:43.930
Okay.
Here,
turn this up.
Goodnight.
You fucks.
See Tomorrow,
eight millimeter footage

3228
02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:48.570
<v 5>and they're hitting now toward elm street.
They're on Houston Street now.</v>

3229
02:53:49.210 --> 02:53:50.460
They're going to make a left hand turn.

3230
02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:53.370
It's on the corner where they going to make the turn there that the book

3231
02:53:53.371 --> 02:53:56.850
depository was now this is the Zapruder film.
Okay,

3232
02:53:56.851 --> 02:54:00.090
so the cars are coming along now into Dealey Plaza?
Yes.

3233
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:02.580
These are the lead motorcycles of the motorcade.
All right.

3234
02:54:02.581 --> 02:54:06.900
Now with the president and Mrs County has also governor Connally right now

3235
02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:09.720
before he goes behind the sign,
the president is waving to the crowd.

3236
02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:13.270
When he comes out from behind the sign,
he is shot.
Then governor Connally,

3237
02:54:13.271 --> 02:54:14.700
his shot,
he's already been hit.

3238
02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:19.680
He's already been hit and now at the bottom of the screen,
the hit shot,

3239
02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:22.200
that's the shot that blew off his head.

3240
02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:25.350
It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen in the movies.

3241
02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:29.130
Now the Warren Commission said that all of the shots were fired from behind by

3242
02:54:29.131 --> 02:54:30.340
Lee Harvey Oswald alone,

3243
02:54:30.341 --> 02:54:35.340
the SAS and firing out the president and then she could see clearly the head is

3244
02:54:35.341 --> 02:54:39.150
thrown violently backwards.
Completely consistent with the shot from the front.

3245
02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:40.440
Right now.

3246
02:54:40.441 --> 02:54:44.190
This is an extreme blowup of just the president from the film

3247
02:54:45.870 --> 02:54:48.530
coming up behind the sign.
He shot,
he's hit from the sit here,

3248
02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:53.220
the front to from the front.
Now,
Jackie doesn't realize what's happened yet.

3249
02:54:53.221 --> 02:54:55.590
She goes to his aid and now

3250
02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:01.770
he's hit again.
The violent backward motion,

3251
02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:05.240
totally consistent with 80% of the witnesses,

3252
02:55:05.241 --> 02:55:07.980
which said the shock came from the grassy knoll in front until the writing.

3253
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:11.510
It's interesting to know how many people is running to Raj,

3254
02:55:11.511 --> 02:55:13.490
where most folks thought the shots came from.

3255
02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:18.440
The head goes backwards in the next either side of the street.

3256
02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:20.600
Oh God.
That's awful.

3257
02:55:22.610 --> 02:55:25.760
That's the most upsetting thing I've ever seen and we'll talk about in a minute.

3258
02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:36.380
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>
