WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just a perfect situation and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's a UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about UFC fight companion</v>

5
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is so ridiculously fun.</v>

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>More fun than doing it live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And then what I was saying is what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>him super crazy special for me.</v>

8
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I look forward to them so much as it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the best possible podcast</v>

9
00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most fun at the funniest shit.</v>

10
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>We could talk about anything we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about gay shit.</v>

11
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

12
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>We can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can talk about sucking Dick.</v>

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>We could talk and we totally get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and people started getting sick</v>

14
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>of it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should probably pull back.</v>

15
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them more deck.</v>

16
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

17
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting pissed this and some</v>

18
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>people are getting past those people you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't worry about.</v>

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>But the coolest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not the whole assemble it makes it</v>

20
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>extra cool is it's the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast situation period.</v>

21
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a UFC going on at the same</v>

22
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking time and we're all having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't take it.</v>

23
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like you were doing a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funniest shit ever while the</v>

24
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>greatest show that's ever been invented</v>
<v Speaker 1>on at the same time,</v>

25
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>a combination of those things and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fica is boring.</v>

26
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>If for whatever reason it's stagnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just start talking about fucking</v>

27
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>owls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>EMC,</v>

28
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but if people get upset talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks lik that's just where the</v>

29
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>conversation goes sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that.</v>

30
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>We're trying the best we can to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>

31
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>That's all we're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be some slip ups.</v>

32
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>If you feel like we're getting too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick in there,</v>

33
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to express yourself.</v>

34
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I must have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might have a pretty strong gay</v>

35
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>following now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we do.</v>

36
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I hope we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably know.</v>

37
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I hope we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're making them feel comfortable.</v>

38
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I hope they do feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just keeping it real.</v>

39
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I see a guy like Alan on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just keep it real.</v>

40
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a beautiful man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more important than who gives a</v>

41
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even remotely controversial that we</v>

43
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>would have a gay following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably have a following of Irish</v>

44
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>people to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

45
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck taking of the Irish</v>

46
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got them right here.</v>

47
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey listen,</v>

48
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has balls.</v>

49
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>This is why I respect the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor Mcgregor.</v>

50
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Not just because he's an awesome fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

51
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>he lost Nate Diaz who's also an awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

52
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck will fight anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 1>will just jump up.</v>

53
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Alaska was Bj.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj tried it and you know what?</v>

54
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Even though a Bj didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had success once.</v>

55
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>At least at one 70 he beat Matt Hughes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

56
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a really good reason why all</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite boxers,</v>

57
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>

58
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>weight cutting is so massively</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

59
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Virtually everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some crazy people out there</v>

60
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>like Anthony Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the exception,</v>

61
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but generally there's a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason most people are torturing</v>

62
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>themselves to get as light as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the elite level,</v>

63
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>five pounds makes a big fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

64
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just five pounds,</v>

65
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds.</v>

66
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Different</v>

67
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>elite level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

68
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Even the best guys aren't going up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went looking for Mendez,</v>

69
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably pound for pound.</v>

70
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 2>The best guy in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably him and Marcello's.</v>

71
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.941
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>

72
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>they're all up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

73
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.870

<v Speaker 2>There's so many good guys.</v>

74
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Now Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

75
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

76
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.250

<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They all love eating.</v>

86
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 2>It means it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

87

<v Speaker 2>Jay was.</v>

89
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Pj was the one that said fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went up to light heavyweight and</v>

90
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:57.514
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

91
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Five foot eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

92
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even light heavyweight bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was heavyweight because Livida</v>

93
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Machida was like two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

94
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

95
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that fight was like technically</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heavyweight fight.</v>

96
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with Bj Penn Cheetah,</v>

97
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was fat that's out of shape,</v>

98
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.830
<v Speaker 2>but you ever see when he used to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kickbox fat,</v>

99
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 2>his first UFC fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not as real weight.</v>

100
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>His real weight is 205,</v>
<v Speaker 2>185.</v>

101
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 2>but Bj did it and I always admired him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

103
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and to me I looked,</v>

104
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll always look at Bj as a living</v>
<v Speaker 2>legend.</v>

105
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy didn't.</v>

106
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 2>He's not undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got his ass beat a few times.</v>

107
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what Bj did.</v>

108
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 2>He had the balls to step up and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a 45 or just like,</v>

109
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>just like there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole time he was a foreigner.</v>

110
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And in Jujitsu he was a 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always a 45 or fighting at 55 70.</v>

111
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

112
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here he comes.</v>

113
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy</v>

114
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.400
<v Speaker 2>has so much power in his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had that courage to think he could</v>

115
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 2>finish what Bj started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 2>let me go up there and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do what Bj did.</v>

117
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.021
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118

182
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.170

<v Speaker 2>It looked like Karma was just had his</v>

183
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 2>hands down because I got this mother</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was tagging them,</v>

185
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 2>it looked like you heard them a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

186
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 2>He tagged them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

187
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>

189
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.990

<v Speaker 2>it finished and,</v>

190
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 2>and when he put that fucking rear naked</v>
<v Speaker 2>choke and he put that motherfucker in</v>

191
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.140
<v Speaker 2>like a Super Ninja,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight,</v>

192
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he mounted,</v>

193
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never know the way he fucking</v>

194
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>mounted and his balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see the balance.</v>

195
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 2>You could see the beauty in that mound</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way he was riding him,</v>

196
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>like a professional fucking a champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodeo.</v>

198
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>All beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he took his back,</v>

199
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>the way he put that fucking Hook in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

200
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it was so efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a hiccup where he hit the,</v>

201
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this jaw and then if you have a set up</v>

202
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 1>and then to feel it just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking insanity.</v>

203
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>So perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fucking like that technique was</v>

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>about is flawless and as beautiful as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get,</v>

205
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>two big points was that we had never</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen conor face adversity and we had</v>

206
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>never seen him on the ground with a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.</v>

207
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Like nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate's got a nasty ground game man.</v>

208
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>His name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

209
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 1>People are talking to a lot of shit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor's Jujitsu.</v>

210
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I know connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

213
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>he was already here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if he wasn't her,</v>

214
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I get mounted by my purple belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and I get my bag.</v>

215
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.660
<v Speaker 1>There's some shit going on and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches and fucking all this height.</v>

216
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Just because he got mountain and got us</v>
<v Speaker 1>back taking does not mean connor's</v>

217
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it twisted.</v>

218
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>He was a little hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is really good stuff.</v>

219
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

220
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Like Nate Diaz could probably do that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

221
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean I suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

222
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>He could probably get my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean I suck.</v>

223
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm a high,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he got hurt him.</v>

225
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get tagged the way he got</v>

226
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>tagged trying to take Nate Diaz down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got hurt.</v>

227
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>He probably had no idea what the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

228
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had an MMA fight,</v>

229
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:30.690

<v Speaker 1>but when travis hit me,</v>

232
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

233
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of it.</v>

234
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that we should get punched in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face,</v>

235
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but I can't judge his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're judging is walking if you get</v>

236
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>head kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commerce.</v>

237
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz.</v>

238
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is just way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

239
00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>If that's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly punches you in the face and</v>

240
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>then you walk funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

241
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to work on your walking.</v>

242
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Funny memes of Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like add in like a kids Jujitsu class.</v>

243
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They put a slice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one that's going around that.</v>

244
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he's heard?</v>

245
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>He is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

246
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Connors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is very,</v>

247
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>very standard to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a joke,</v>

248
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>especially in that first round was nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

249
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>like very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a look.</v>

250
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a real one.</v>

251
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 1>70 old lady did fight one 70 twice.</v>

252
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>He fought a stun gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim and fought rory.</v>

253
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Rory Macdonald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that?</v>

254
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Fought those guys at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did have to fight at one 70,</v>

255
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>but he's a 1:50 fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are big one.</v>

256
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:37.140
<v Speaker 1>50th five or he's big and long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he could ever make 1:45.</v>

257
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor barely can do it.</v>

258
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor apparently can do it.</v>

259
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 1>When you see conor at the weigh ins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those photos from the winds are</v>

260
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 1>pretty legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's insane that we do this,</v>

261
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 1>that we let these guys dehydrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves like that.</v>

262
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever nature walks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he should fight.</v>

263
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if connor really walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at one slash 68,</v>

264
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>which would he weighed in and nate raid</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 69.</v>

265
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>There were only one pound different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Nate,</v>

266
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate had some body fat on him because he</v>

267
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't preparing for this at all.</v>

268
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I think connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor could make some noise at 1:55</v>

269
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>shrink down to see the two of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

270
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Can we look at the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we weighed in before and how he</v>

271
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>weighed in this time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

272
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he has some fucking crazy</v>

273
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 1>disease that like won't let food</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbent his body on the top one,</v>

274
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got some crazy illness and</v>

275
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>then on the bottom he looks great full</v>
<v Speaker 1>faced.</v>

276
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.240
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can make 1:45,</v>

277
00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 1>he's going to continue to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you think gets in.</v>

278
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The girls are like sitting right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an accident is perfect for the</v>

279
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they stand their ultimate</v>

280
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to balance out that dude in</v>

281
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>underwear</v>
<v Speaker 1>put chips in there.</v>

282
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

283
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think he could completely</v>

284
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 1>dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continue to dominate the 1:45 division</v>

285
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and I think he could make a lot of epic</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights at 1:55,</v>

286
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went beat some big names but then lose</v>

287
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>to some other big names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he'll be one of the top guys at 55.</v>

288
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he'll just clean house</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he did at 45,</v>

289
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but I believe if he stayed at 55 he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do some serious damage.</v>

290
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>He's a shitty saying after the fight.</v>

292
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect Shit.</v>

293
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I love what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how he's handling it.</v>

294
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he handled it his last better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody ever,</v>

295
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said children victory and I'm be</v>

296
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 1>humbling defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what happened in that fight.</v>

297
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>His next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever he's fighting,</v>

298
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

299
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 1>would it be fights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos Anjos,</v>

301
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to cut them up.</v>

302
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I bet it tags them a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>

303
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I bet he tags and I bet you're asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>tag everybody to hit some people and</v>

304
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>just because he got knocked out a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

305
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 1>every half the people get knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fights.</v>

306
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.880
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>

307
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 1>he got cracked and he got choked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

308
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in to see how he handles</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physicality of Dos Anjos who's a lot</v>

309
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 1>more physical than nate.</v>

310
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dos Anjos is a beast.</v>

311
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know if he could do to connor</v>

312
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>what he was able to do to nate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was able to do to a lot of guys</v>

313
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>like pedis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he did to pedis,</v>

314
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you know that God is strong as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was so bummed out when he broke</v>

315
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 1>his foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

322
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:41.560

<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>

323
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers know what's funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he kept saying,</v>

347
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.470
<v Speaker 3>She's the number one contender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When does that ferocious?</v>

348
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.320
<v Speaker 3>She's ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the ultimate fighter Bolus will.</v>

349
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One to John Jay.</v>

350
00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Check is ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Claudia good.</v>

351
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.091
<v Speaker 3>Dahlia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

352
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:10.020
<v Speaker 3>there it is in Brazil fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

353
00:16:10.021 --> 00:16:13.110
<v Speaker 3>she's a Nova on yow girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's good.</v>

354
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.600
<v Speaker 3>She's a fuck Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real good.</v>

355
00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and strong as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong as shit.</v>

356
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 3>When they fought the first time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was winning was on the ground and</v>

357
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:23.220
<v Speaker 3>she was doing well on the feet too.</v>

358
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.240
<v Speaker 3>But you on a corner with a big upper cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the first round of rocked</v>

359
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when she's trying to take her down</v>

360
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to go back and watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember specifics that you want a</v>

361
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.240
<v Speaker 3>cracker with a big upper cut and hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

362
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.560
<v Speaker 3>but that Claudia had overwhelmed her and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the ground exchanges and a lot</v>

363
00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:43.110
<v Speaker 3>of people were thinking that you and Jay</v>
<v Speaker 3>check was going to have more problems</v>

364
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:45.990
<v Speaker 3>with grapplers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Carla Esparza or like,</v>

365
00:16:45.991 --> 00:16:46.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

366
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Carl was a wrestler or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

367
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juliana pinay.</v>

368
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.363
<v Speaker 3>What's now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

369
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Jessica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jessica Panay,</v>

370
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.370
<v Speaker 3>the second title defense that she had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These girls try to wrestle with her</v>

371
00:16:59.371 --> 00:16:59.771
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can.</v>

372
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:01.440
<v Speaker 3>You can't wrestle with her anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>

373
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.210
<v Speaker 3>She got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's nasty.</v>

374
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.370
<v Speaker 3>She's really fucking slick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Standing up.</v>

375
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.060
<v Speaker 3>And apparently they just went to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just on the set,</v>

376
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.350
<v Speaker 3>beat the shit out of each other.</v>

377
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 3>You're Dana White.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do with a Misha Dude?</v>

378
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Pillow her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's huge,</v>

379
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.610
<v Speaker 3>but who have regis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

380
00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:22.860
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give her a world tour first.</v>

381
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.130
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she won one of the greatest victories in</v>

382
00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:31.131
<v Speaker 3>the history of mma down down on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>score cards in the fourth round with two</v>

383
00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:34.500
<v Speaker 3>minutes to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hits a take down,</v>

384
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.920
<v Speaker 3>takes her back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost gets shook over the top,</v>

385
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:39.990
<v Speaker 3>hangs on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hangs on.</v>

386
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 3>That was so dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like the end of.</v>

387
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.710
<v Speaker 3>She fought so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did everything that all the experts</v>

388
00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>were saying she was going to need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did everything.</v>

389
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 3>She didn't rush in Russian and she had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pull it off.</v>

390
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was our minute left?</v>

391
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Tom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like somewhere around two minutes to go</v>

392
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 3>when she went for the take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When she,</v>

393
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.610
<v Speaker 3>when she got ahold of her.</v>

394
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 3>So you're down to last round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last round.</v>

395
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy wasn't winning the round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing really had happened.</v>

396
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:10.520
<v Speaker 3>That was like big and significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a takedown,</v>

397
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.040
<v Speaker 3>probably lose it on the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crappy.</v>

398
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look at the cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

399
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 3>she won that one round for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When she take her down and that went</v>

400
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 3>made everybody go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

401
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that the second was at the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>round that she took her down?</v>

402
00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 3>This was dominating her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

403
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the second her was</v>

404
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surprisingly.</v>

405
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Her wrestling is a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

406
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Before she's hustling to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hustled,</v>

407
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 3>she keeps getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Holly Holm and easy to take down.</v>

408
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Take down the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like her main shit too.</v>

409
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Probably works on her takedown defense</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than her Jujitsu.</v>

410
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 3>So this is the cards.</v>

411
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.303
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

412
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.680
<v Speaker 3>So what does it say in basically what</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going in here?</v>

413
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should take this hard to do.</v>

414
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.950
<v Speaker 3>These are confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>White,</v>

415
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:52.731
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink.</v>

416
00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a pink card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the.</v>

417
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different people.</v>

418
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Just as the referee's names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

419
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.140
<v Speaker 3>So round nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 10,</v>

420
00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.730
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

421
00:19:04.731 --> 00:19:05.870
<v Speaker 3>who's reading?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's blue?</v>

422
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blue on the left.</v>

423
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how.</v>

424
00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it must've been the.</v>

425
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

426
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

427
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 3>All three at 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine for the first.</v>

428
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 3>All three had 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight for the second,</v>

429
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.620
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

430
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 3>And all three at 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine for the third and for the fourth.</v>

431
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 3>So does that make it a draw?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

432
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.770
<v Speaker 3>that means holly was ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how do they judge the fourth and</v>

433
00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>then the fifth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she would say head in the fourth.</v>

434
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.580
<v Speaker 3>So holly was ahead by one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

435
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.633
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

436
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Even though she'd won three rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

437
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she would have won that round,</v>

438
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:42.140
<v Speaker 3>it would have been a draw I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

439
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't really willing around right</v>

440
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised that they all gave him a</v>

441
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.860
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

442
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very good.</v>

443
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Good to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their name is Marcos for solids.</v>

444
00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a.</v>

445
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.310
<v Speaker 3>That was a real tenant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should look.</v>

446
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Someone takes you down and beat the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of you.</v>

447
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.930
<v Speaker 3>But just what an what a finish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

448
00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 3>What was amazing about it and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>holly fought smart.</v>

449
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:08.050
<v Speaker 3>She used that side kick a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so good with her movement.</v>

450
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 3>She caught me with a lot of punches to</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

451
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.400
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't going after her.</v>

452
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.620
<v Speaker 3>She would catch her with punches and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay on the outside.</v>

453
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.560
<v Speaker 3>She was fighting a smart fight and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>got taken down.</v>

454
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 3>She got dominated on the ground by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meesha and that's when I was like,</v>

455
00:20:20.231 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

456
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.710
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking top game is solid as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

457
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Like her control is excellent and her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking strong man.</v>

458
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.200
<v Speaker 3>She's drunk because holly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm is strong.</v>

459
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I was really impressed with their ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pound really impressed with our top</v>

460
00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:37.990
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you know what man,</v>

461
00:20:37.991 --> 00:20:40.510
<v Speaker 3>the next round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm got right back on her fucking</v>

462
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.110
<v Speaker 3>bicycle and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

463
00:20:42.111 --> 00:20:45.010
<v Speaker 3>and probably in everyone's eyes when</v>
<v Speaker 3>that round,</v>

464
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those judges eyes to me.</v>

465
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:48.184
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

466
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>if that would have wanted a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I would've given it to holly just</v>

467
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:53.720
<v Speaker 1>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending upon how that no real damage.</v>

469
00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:59.180
<v Speaker 1>She never knocked me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never hurt me shit.</v>

470
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the shepherd.</v>

471
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Her never heard her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tagged her a couple times where,</v>

472
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she snapped her head back a little bit,</v>

473
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't anything like what she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs giving out.</v>

474
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

475
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about to be a semi boring</v>

476
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>decision overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who would want to watch that fight</v>

477
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second round is kind of cool.</v>

478
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It was going to be one of those fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like that,</v>

479
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 1>she turned it into one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights ever.</v>

480
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Amazing comeback that last second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a grand slam and the bottom</v>

481
00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>of the ninth and the scramble to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back,</v>

482
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>her scramble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way she held on as Hollywood kept</v>

483
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 1>moving and changing and adjusting.</v>

484
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>She kept holding on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then finally the Hail Mary Hollie tries</v>

485
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:40.710
<v Speaker 1>to flip her over the top and she hangs</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

486
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.520
<v Speaker 1>hangs onto the choke and sinks it in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets the hooks in and,</v>

487
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and when holly goes to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching in the air,</v>

488
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you know those old nfl films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you watch those superbowl from</v>

489
00:21:53.471 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 1>1978 or something to have that voice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're together.</v>

490
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 1>They're doing the slow mo and these all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these old,</v>

491
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorable place like epic plays in 20</v>

492
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.920
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they look back at that and they</v>

493
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 1>have some old like Orson Welles type a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrator talking about,</v>

494
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 1>about going through all that transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of drama going on there,</v>

495
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't just take her back and choke</v>

496
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of shit.</v>

497
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of shit to handle what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and watch what's happening.</v>

498
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're naked chokes.</v>

499
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Speaker 1>The scrambled though to scramble was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so epic because the drama building</v>

500
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:32.651
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

501
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Speaker 1>She's down on the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

502
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't watch that were watched?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

503
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:38.510
<v Speaker 1>we can never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once she down on the car,</v>

504
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:43.511
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely she's about to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's about to lose a decision probably.</v>

505
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got ahold of her.</v>

506
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on her back.</v>

507
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got that job,</v>

508
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.690
<v Speaker 1>kept going and going back and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly went to sleep,</v>

509
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like she didn't even tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went out.</v>

510
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>She went out punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was throwing punches.</v>

511
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 1>When she went out to your bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be to go out throwing</v>

512
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:04.500
<v Speaker 1>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

513
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That girl is.</v>

514
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>She went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went out like throwing punches.</v>

515
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

516
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That was a good fight.</v>

517
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

518
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Back the best fight of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that the biggest UFC ever.</v>

519
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

520
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:23.950
<v Speaker 1>That was the biggest UFC ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

521
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I would sat that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not the fight of the night.</v>

522
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The both equally insane.</v>

523
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no like one better finale or one</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

524
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the conor fight was more</v>

525
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 1>excited because all the way through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a lot of damage going on.</v>

526
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of fire going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the holly fight.</v>

527
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of dancing around taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

528
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 3>definitely it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot less action overall.</v>

530
00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you compress those,</v>

531
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 3>if you take out a couple of those rounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and compress it all into one round,</v>

532
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

533
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you got to be pleased by</v>
<v Speaker 3>it through the whole thing.</v>

534
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I think what's most important is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>after it ends you have some definitive</v>

535
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 3>conclusion and if it takes a while to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that definitive conclusion,</v>

536
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's going to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighters are tactical.</v>

537
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.060
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was because of that that made the</v>

538
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 3>end so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without that.</v>

539
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Then it wouldn't have been so juicy at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>

540
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she had gone through the full</v>

541
00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 3>five or when they were in the fifth</v>
<v Speaker 3>round and there was like,</v>

542
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 3>we've got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's trying things and not working.</v>

543
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 3>She tries this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works really good.</v>

544
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now how he's trying this that's working</v>

545
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 3>meets is trying that.</v>

546
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.630
<v Speaker 3>That's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

547
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Now she's started to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When she got,</v>

548
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 3>she got to do something different to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to her.</v>

549
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 3>How's she going to figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Down on the score.</v>

550
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Shoots for the fucking take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grabs a hold of her kitchen.</v>

551
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Chokes or unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

552
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have been that low from</v>

553
00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:44.980
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

554
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 3>To the place went insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

555
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:51.630
<v Speaker 3>It was so epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Dalmatia Tate,</v>

556
00:24:51.631 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

557
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 3>She was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so nice.</v>

558
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's such a like her and holly.</v>

559
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:02.951
<v Speaker 3>They're both so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so nice to see nice people like</v>

00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 3>that do really well in such a brutal</v>
<v Speaker 3>savage sport.</v>

561
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's really nice.</v>

562
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Like when have you ever use or Misha</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tate's?</v>

563
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Never like raised her voice at anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She never yelled at anybody.</v>

564
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 3>She's like real friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's real sweet to see her.</v>

565
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 3>The UFC bantamweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

566
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

567
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Well performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think holly is a little bit nicer</v>

568
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's super nice.</v>

569
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 3>She seems like there's some country like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>

570
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's the preacher's daughter.</v>

571
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 3>She really did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She really is.</v>

572
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.800
<v Speaker 3>She really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

573
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 3>And she's tough as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

574
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 3>She went out punching a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like throwing punches.</v>

575
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 3>She just wants to get the interposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just want her to get back into it.</v>

576
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.653
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when do you.</v>

577
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.720
<v Speaker 3>She just wants to get back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I loved about the preflight</v>

578
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>speech when she was talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight itself,</v>

579
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

580
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda is going to be out for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

581
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fighting for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fighting for fame.</v>

582
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I want the action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight like,</v>

583
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

584
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:05.100
<v Speaker 3>wild with you.</v>

585
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 3>That's how you got to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be great,</v>

586
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something to focus on.</v>

587
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be a holly Holm,</v>

588
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess you have to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to be a 19 time world's women</v>

589
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 3>boxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be a crazy motivated</v>

590
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got to.</v>

591
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 3>She's got to fall in love with Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

592
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.830
<v Speaker 3>because she's not the biggest fan of Jiu</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jitsu.</v>

593
00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 3>She really needs that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had said before that I know that.</v>

594
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I know that's hard to swallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 3>but you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be one of those fighters that.</v>

596
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of them out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

597
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't really want to get</v>

598
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:41.710
<v Speaker 3>offensively good at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't really have a,</v>

599
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they weren't attracted to passing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>garden,</v>

600
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>taking</v>

601
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 2>the back and choke and PPI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wrestlers out there</v>

602
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>that just wanted to keep it on the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a little to defense and if you have</v>

603
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>to take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in half guard and pound them out</v>

604
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 2>and just keep it simple and keep it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

605
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

606
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of wrestlers like that.</v>

607
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Now that she's the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're strikers.</v>

608
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 2>They're strikers like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a quite a few throughout</v>

609
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 2>the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>champions that didn't really want to</v>

610
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 2>work on their Jujitsu the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right way,</v>

611
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>which is sparring with everybody and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking her up sparring upon.</v>

612
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 2>And just jumping into the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how in O'connor's good,</v>

613
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 2>because connor does that and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get way better.</v>

614
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 2>He's actually good at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just nate is a lot better,</v>

615
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:25.281
<v Speaker 2>but I think holly needs to have somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow it needs to happen.</v>

616
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she needs to fall in love with</v>

617
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that's where people</v>

618
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.150
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

619
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>that's the spot we were already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't really seen her on her back.</v>

620
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.840
<v Speaker 2>We haven't seen a reactive Jujitsu now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have and Mischa just exposed her and</v>

621
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 2>she needs to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She needs to take care of that and fall</v>

622
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 2>in love with Jujitsu and start getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Instagram,</v>

623
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:48.950
<v Speaker 2>taking pictures with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

624
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's got a blue belt and be all</v>

625
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got to be really happy about it</v>

626
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 2>because she needs a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

627
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a hole right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where people are going to try</v>

628
00:27:57.601 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 2>to take her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not that hard to take down.</v>

629
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she'd be harder to take down,</v>

630
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She took her down.</v>

631
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha mixes up or take Dante.</v>

632
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.093
<v Speaker 2>She goes to</v>

633
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.600
<v Speaker 3>up and she goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>download.</v>

634
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Ronda is like upper body clench.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's really an upper body clench,</v>

635
00:28:11.111 --> 00:28:15.820
<v Speaker 3>so all holly had to do also Rondon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fight was so insanely aggressive.</v>

636
00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Her charging after made it so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier for counters.</v>

637
00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Misha was super crafty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She liked very patient,</v>

638
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.280
<v Speaker 3>very patient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>varied.</v>

639
00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Her movement varied or timing didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>any like,</v>

640
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.070
<v Speaker 3>like she didn't continue any patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

641
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Her stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She moved around a lot and she did a lot</v>

642
00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:36.010
<v Speaker 3>of Juke in and a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did a lot of different stuff.</v>

643
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Stayed on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made holly come after her.</v>

644
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>

645
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.210
<v Speaker 3>If you're a really good counter striker</v>
<v Speaker 3>like holly is for her,</v>

646
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:45.550
<v Speaker 3>the best thing is a Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone's going to run at her.</v>

647
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 3>The best thing is someone running out or</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

648
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.890
<v Speaker 3>She's so fleet like her footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so excellent.</v>

649
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.360
<v Speaker 3>She sold light on her feet that she's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at just sliding out of the way and</v>

650
00:28:55.361 --> 00:28:57.940
<v Speaker 3>cracking you while you're coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the things she's best</v>

651
00:28:57.941 --> 00:29:00.490
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you fight that,</v>

652
00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 3>we're against her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of fight that happens.</v>

653
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:04.450
<v Speaker 3>You'll look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she looks like a master,</v>

654
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:09.310
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at her fight in the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>first UFC fight with Raquel Pennington,</v>

655
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.780
<v Speaker 3>she wanted a split decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

656
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a fight where raquel fought</v>

657
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.380
<v Speaker 3>more cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little smarter,</v>

658
00:29:14.381 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 3>new new holly's background coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

659
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.400
<v Speaker 3>if you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't engage with her.</v>

660
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when Anderson was in,</v>

661
00:29:23.231 --> 00:29:26.620
<v Speaker 3>his prime guys came after him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just butchered him.</v>

662
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.890
<v Speaker 3>But if guys hung back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the fight was boring,</v>

663
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

664
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:32.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talus latest.</v>

665
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Remember tonsillitis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hung back and he kind of waited for</v>

666
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.903
<v Speaker 3>Anderson.</v>

667
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with Patrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrick de hung back,</v>

668
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.360
<v Speaker 3>he just fought smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

669
00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to charge it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run it in anything.</v>

670
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:42.401
<v Speaker 3>Come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

671
00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 3>get me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come get me.</v>

672
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.720
<v Speaker 3>And coach k like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

673
00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 3>he's had a big right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody had to be real careful.</v>

674
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 3>You always have to be careful because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

675
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 3>if you're coming at him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could always catch you.</v>

676
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And if a guy like [inaudible] catches</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

677
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 3>he just had that stupid power in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

678
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 3>He could just knock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knocked out Tito at two.</v>

679
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

680
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 3>He knocked him out down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked him down to take a shot.</v>

681
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 3>But he knocked him down at two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>

682
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.520
<v Speaker 3>And he fights it one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

683
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Patrick Ho taken crack.</v>

684
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 3>So Anderson never want Patrick Blues</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neon.</v>

685
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:13.620
<v Speaker 3>That fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

686
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 3>He like went to throw a kick and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee just gave out.</v>

687
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 3>It's really exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

688
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:21.840
<v Speaker 3>He fought a very smart fight to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's that stain when you,</v>

689
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 3>you find a killer counter striker like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

690
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 3>The big thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them lead.</v>

691
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to lead.</v>

692
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Make it a boring fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it be boring.</v>

693
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Move around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be patient me.</v>

694
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 3>She did everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

695
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda.</v>

696
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Meesha three would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

697
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

698
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 3>It's probably what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>next according to what I've read on the</v>

699
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Internet because I have here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what Rhonda would want.</v>

700
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Would she want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably a rematch with her after a</v>

701
00:30:48.631 --> 00:30:53.020
<v Speaker 3>loss or a title shot if I was her</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was a tough choice.</v>

702
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Rather if I was her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was a tough choice,</v>

703
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:56.901
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

704
00:30:56.901 --> 00:30:57.734
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be her.</v>

705
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 3>If I was her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly I would probably,</v>

706
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine if I was her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to avenge the loss because</v>

707
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.153
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

708
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 3>her first loss and she doesn't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did her best and I'm fight and that</v>

709
00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 3>fight was just too much going on.</v>

710
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.960
<v Speaker 3>If you hear her talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like there was just overwhelmed</v>

711
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 3>with obligations and shit and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought wrong.</v>

712
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't fight correctly.</v>

713
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Just had real problems going into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have like her approach like</v>

714
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 3>kitten in Holly's face the way in trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it real emotional,</v>

715
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fake ass bitch and all that stuff.</v>

716
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:35.680
<v Speaker 3>And then all that emotions when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought in the ranks just running after</v>

717
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 3>holly and holly just fall like a master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the best performances</v>

718
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 3>you'll ever see of a striker and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gating a person's aggression.</v>

719
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Like she just did it so brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cash.</v>

720
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with elbows coming in,</v>

721
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 3>catching it with straight lefts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that fucking set up for the</v>

722
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:57.040
<v Speaker 3>head kick when Rhonda is all stumbling</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she just catches her with that head</v>

723
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>kick him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just a spectacular mixed martial</v>

724
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:01.720
<v Speaker 3>arts performance overall.</v>

725
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like title winning efforts in any weight</v>

726
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:09.640
<v Speaker 3>class as far as like a sheer domination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right up there with Tj dillashaw</v>

727
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Hanan Barao one but more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably more scary.</v>

728
00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the most spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight clips ever where she's getting</v>

729
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.034
<v Speaker 3>clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

730
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

731
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like she's a bad ass,</v>

732
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I think about holly is,</v>

733
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:25.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holly get back on track and uh,</v>

734
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really hope that she takes that advice</v>

735
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 3>that you just gave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that'd be real smart.</v>

736
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.280
<v Speaker 3>You've got to somehow fall in love and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not fight it no more.</v>

737
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she fights it.</v>

738
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

739
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.850
<v Speaker 3>She's just so good at kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she just wants to stay sharp in</v>

740
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 3>that and that's what she wants to do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls because she feels like she has</v>

741
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 3>this big advantage of them against them</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

742
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 3>But obviously she needs a little work on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and I think she'll get better.</v>

743
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:51.921
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

744
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 3>she can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can still improve,</v>

745
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think maybe there's also the</v>

746
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming pressure that must come</v>
<v Speaker 3>from being a champ,</v>

747
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 3>like that experience probably takes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while to learn how to navigate it.</v>

748
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm wrong and she's already in</v>
<v Speaker 3>love with it.</v>

749
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.240
<v Speaker 3>That would be awesome if I was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

750
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for Holly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like holly.</v>

751
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly,</v>

752
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.610
<v Speaker 3>could you not agree with a course?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could I not like it?</v>

753
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm just being real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if that hurts anybody.</v>

754
00:33:14.221 --> 00:33:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

755
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:14.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

756
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're saying is important</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hope and I hope that I'm wrong.</v>

757
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.200
<v Speaker 3>I hope that you have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's totally into it.</v>

758
00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Speaker 3>She's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just hasn't worked on it,</v>

759
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 3>that loan or whatever what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would love to see Holly Hall with</v>

760
00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 3>an aggressive offer back and dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>offer back.</v>

761
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason why she couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's super athletic.</v>

762
00:33:32.331 --> 00:33:37.331
<v Speaker 3>She has a crazy work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car by her designer and I'm Brendan</v>

763
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:39.794
<v Speaker 3>batch.</v>

764
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.310
<v Speaker 3>There was a fight on the undercard</v>
<v Speaker 3>batches,</v>

765
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.940
<v Speaker 3>a super talented guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

766
00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 3>super talented karate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a bar does.</v>

767
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Auto was able to take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any answers off his back.</v>

768
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of those examples of a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a really talented striker where</v>

769
00:33:55.111 --> 00:33:57.720
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting to see the full</v>
<v Speaker 3>extent of his talent because he has a</v>

770
00:33:57.721 --> 00:34:01.170
<v Speaker 3>difficult time fighting off his back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a difficult time keeping guys from</v>

771
00:34:01.171 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 3>taking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just,</v>

772
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's guys are figuring that out with him</v>

773
00:34:05.401 --> 00:34:09.270
<v Speaker 3>and a couple guys have dominated him on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground and it's just unfortunate</v>

774
00:34:09.271 --> 00:34:11.610
<v Speaker 3>because he's so talented with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>striking.</v>

775
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want to go,</v>

776
00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:16.500
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could figure out a way to find</v>

777
00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:19.710
<v Speaker 3>balance in your skill set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good would he be?</v>

778
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so good standing up,</v>

779
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.150
<v Speaker 3>but by her does auto man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

780
00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 3>that guy hits hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got one of those weird punching</v>

781
00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:31.320
<v Speaker 3>power bodies like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make familiar with him.</v>

782
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.100
<v Speaker 3>He's from Afghanistan who was born in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan and grew up in Holland I</v>

783
00:34:35.101 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

784
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 3>but he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he did.</v>

785
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did he trained with?</v>

786
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.593
<v Speaker 5>Um.</v>

787
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg Jackson,</v>

788
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.460
<v Speaker 3>who was at Greg Jackson's camp for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's been out for like 800 days.</v>

789
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 3>He had some serious injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both the rooms almost three years.</v>

790
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Two and A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

791
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.060
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more than two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had both his Labor rooms had to be</v>

792
00:34:58.061 --> 00:35:00.070
<v Speaker 3>operated on and broke his hand fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

793
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Which one's the labor room and say your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder.</v>

794
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a bunch of shit operated on.</v>

795
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.190
<v Speaker 3>And so he was out for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to see him come back and see,</v>

796
00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.620
<v Speaker 3>like in the beginning you see them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his back and he tries to,</v>

797
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.850
<v Speaker 3>he almost catches a triangle who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws up his legs and you know,</v>

798
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.940
<v Speaker 3>if someone who had a really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle,</v>

799
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.690
<v Speaker 3>nate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nate was in that same position,</v>

800
00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:21.340
<v Speaker 3>he would got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the triangle for sure.</v>

801
00:35:21.341 --> 00:35:24.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was all there or at least he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have secured it and by her desire</v>

802
00:35:24.941 --> 00:35:27.430
<v Speaker 3>with how to defend it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't secure it and I was</v>

803
00:35:27.431 --> 00:35:28.001
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

804
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:29.500
<v Speaker 3>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was right there.</v>

805
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I out of the leg over the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here it was over like this.</v>

806
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.860
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't that much resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grab your fucking ankle,</v>

807
00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>lock that in like what he do and he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

808
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 6>And then you see them for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fight was having a real hard time</v>

809
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 6>fighting off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We see a guy that's good.</v>

810
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 6>He's so talented standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

811
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 6>You watch them throw knees and punches</v>
<v Speaker 6>you like Jesus.</v>

812
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.270
<v Speaker 6>This could be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this kid could be a fucking force.</v>

813
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 6>She's got to really Polish up that</v>
<v Speaker 6>ground game and especially off of his</v>

814
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.380
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

815
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 6>this is a crazy sport,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

816
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.960
<v Speaker 6>You can't just have one way to go</v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

817
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 6>You got to have the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't.</v>

818
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.570
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's very few people that are going</v>

819
00:36:05.571 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 6>to exist in this sport at the upper</v>
<v Speaker 6>echelons with just one way to go.</v>

820
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that's so scary about</v>

821
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:17.571
<v Speaker 6>a guy like nate that nate's needs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boxing is just as good as his Jujitsu.</v>

822
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.070
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his.</v>

823
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.940
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes you don't see the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 6>that much because he's so confident as</v>

824
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 6>boxing and he throws down with guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but guys go to the ground with them.</v>

825
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's choked out some good dude's fucking</v>

826
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.373
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

827
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have some serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>finishing power on the ground.</v>

828
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you on top?</v>

829
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with you on top,</v>

830
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 2>you'd better have finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you just use your bottom game for</v>

831
00:36:41.521 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 2>sweeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

832
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

833
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to finish the guy off</v>
<v Speaker 2>your back.</v>

834
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's always good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

835
00:36:47.091 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 2>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could find it,</v>

836
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're known to finish people off</v>
<v Speaker 2>your back,</v>

837
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 2>that's anytime I roll with anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even a purple belt,</v>

838
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 2>who his specialty is finishing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>off his back end.</v>

839
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:02.170
<v Speaker 2>If there's always those students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm on a roll,</v>

840
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Jeremiah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost rather have the mounting me</v>

841
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.153
<v Speaker 2>hang up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up in,</v>

842
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.280
<v Speaker 2>has got him a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mount made easier to get out of the</v>

843
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is his rubber guard.</v>

844
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Serious craze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's few guys like that,</v>

845
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:16.610
<v Speaker 2>like a Boogie at anytime.</v>

846
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Boogie put me in his garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go right to the mountain.</v>

847
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I gotta check out this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a bad motherfucker</v>

848
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 2>go crazy because that goes against</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional.</v>

849
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

850
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.700
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the greatest,</v>

851
00:37:28.701 --> 00:37:30.330
<v Speaker 2>the greatest posture in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

852
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 2>my lower back's all fucked up so I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to posture out of shit.</v>

853
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go with everything man.</v>

854
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to go that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go and let me see if I could hold</v>

855
00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:40.930
<v Speaker 2>on and get a little clench and then go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back this way.</v>

856
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

857
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too old to a forced my way through</v>

858
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the smart way to do it</v>

859
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:49.884
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

860
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.120
<v Speaker 2>That's my Jujitsu is becoming very</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival now.</v>

861
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:55.870
<v Speaker 2>My guys are fucking me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

862
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.610
<v Speaker 2>There's this phase where I'm getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>tapped out all the goddamn time.</v>

863
00:37:59.611 --> 00:37:59.911
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

864
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:02.780
<v Speaker 2>am I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm the only way I can cap out</v>

865
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 2>certain purple belts as if I have gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm tired and I take around with one</v>

866
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 2>of my purple belts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fucking on,</v>

867
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.650
<v Speaker 2>on a survival mode the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

868
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 2>My guys are coming with fire now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throwing leg locks.</v>

869
00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.240
<v Speaker 2>You leave your feet out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

870
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

871
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.810
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty crazy not getting any leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>

872
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

873
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

874
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Just my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally getting a district meeting.</v>

875
00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Other people in class getting any knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries or anything?</v>

876
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

877
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth that you hurt your arm or</v>

878
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:34.810
<v Speaker 2>your shoulder at the same rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll hurt your knee.</v>

879
00:38:34.811 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 2>We do leg locks all the goddamn time.</v>

880
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

881
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 2>The word planning has always been that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

882
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 2>We never banned reaping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never,</v>

883
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I never frowned upon heel hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally never got really heavy on</v>

884
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 2>heel hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always heavy on lead compressions,</v>

885
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.930
<v Speaker 2>a different style leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always doing those.</v>

886
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll hook so much.</v>

887
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

888
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 2>we've always had heel hook masters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

889
00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't have asked that if</v>

890
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:01.420
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't something that comes up all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

891
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.340
<v Speaker 2>People talk about Lego blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

892
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I kind of know the answer because if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

893
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I would've heard about it that you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have told me.</v>

894
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a myth that leg locks are</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were brought up in Jujitsu,</v>

895
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>the whole Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community</v>
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>

896
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 2>heel hooks and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and frowned upon them.</v>

897
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you remember that time you were</v>

898
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Speaker 2>at a tournament and they started booing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and screaming when you went for guy's</v>

899
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 2>leg?</v>

900
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first,</v>

901
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 2>during my white belt years and into my</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue belt years,</v>

902
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I saw Ken shamrock instructional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing jeans and shit and it's got</v>

903
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:34.760
<v Speaker 2>no shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was wearing jeans and he's like small</v>

904
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>little gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this Japanese guy and he's</v>

905
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.240
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Told from the top,</v>

906
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 2>from top half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was always playing half garlic</v>

907
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 2>right away as a white belt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the worst guard every</v>

908
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 2>quarter guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't get any worse than</v>

909
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:49.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything worse as you got your guard</v>

910
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was always playing the worst shit</v>

911
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 2>because I was small and weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

912
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go up to toe holt?</v>

913
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned from Ken shamrock started</v>

914
00:40:02.741 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 2>going after toehold and I got pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at them.</v>

915
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I was tapping motherfuckers with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

916
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I did this tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first Pan Am's and it was an</v>

917
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>la and Elsa Gundo.</v>

918
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 96 or 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first pan ams I went for a toehold</v>

919
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.740
<v Speaker 2>and there was about $500 Brazilians that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shipped in because it was the first</v>

920
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Pan Am's and there was like this big</v>
<v Speaker 2>retreat and they took me.</v>

921
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 2>They had them all in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hotel right down the street from</v>

922
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was man and shit.</v>

923
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this.</v>

924
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 2>We're an Elsa Gundo la and there was 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazilians that got shipped in for the</v>

925
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Pan Ams and of course they dominated and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed everybody in Jujitsu,</v>

926
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 2>but I did Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian and I put them in a toll.</v>

927
00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Then as soon as I put them in the toll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole crowd went nuts.</v>

928
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a riot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost happened was just a riot.</v>

929
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what stopped them,</v>

930
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 2>but they were throwing shoes at the math</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were throwing bottles at,</v>

931
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

932
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 2>water bottles at me and I was sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there holding a toehold and everyone's</v>

933
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>screaming and under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget Johnny Machado comes running</v>

934
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:07.690
<v Speaker 2>like slow motion and he slacked because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to let it go,</v>

935
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 2>let it go.</v>

936
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

937
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:12.430
<v Speaker 2>And I let it go and then the guy beat me</v>
<v Speaker 2>on points,</v>

938
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.480
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So John Machado slid in and told you,</v>

939
00:41:15.481 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you gotta let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody was going crazy.</v>

940
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or let him contact the legs.</v>

941
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 2>But you weren't supposed to tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dirty.</v>

942
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>It was dirty back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the parking lot like that,</v>

943
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>that mean Joe Green commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that old,</v>

944
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 2>mean Joe Green commercial where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking a coke and there's like a</v>

945
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:30.440
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

946
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a little kid because I ran</v>
<v Speaker 2>into Eric Paulson in the parking lot and</v>

947
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 2>he was getting the same reaction when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was gone for like blocks and he was like</v>

948
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 2>a blue belt at the time and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and uh,</v>

949
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I think we're the same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason I felt always felt</v>

950
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 2>like a little kid and he had all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

951
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.110
<v Speaker 2>He was a blue belt in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy,</v>

952
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:48.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained in Japan and fought and shooto</v>

953
00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was already like a professional</v>

954
00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 2>fighter and an expert at leg locks who</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got into Jujitsu.</v>

955
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 2>So he's competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competing on a blue belt.</v>

956
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Fucking everybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put leg locks,</v>

957
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a Paulson,</v>

958
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Paulson in 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're in the parking lot and he</v>

959
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 2>showed me this leg lock and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

960
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 2>check this out man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget this.</v>

961
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

962
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 2>he saw a little of him in me because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going for a toll because I'll fuck,</v>

963
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 2>look at that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's getting a lot of heat to because</v>

964
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 2>he's going for a leg lock so right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was totally legal.</v>

965
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:20.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have tapped the guy out and it</v>

966
00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:21.850
<v Speaker 2>would have been illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

967
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the rule set.</v>

968
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

969
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:27.570
<v Speaker 2>So my thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were legal and maybe it's</v>

970
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if it was illegal,</v>

971
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:32.590
<v Speaker 2>the crowd erupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Brazilians with nuts and throwing</v>

972
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.600
<v Speaker 2>shoes and screaming and shit for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some belt ranks.</v>

973
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in some tournaments.</v>

974
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

975
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 2>you can do heal hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gracie nationals and Gracie worlds.</v>

976
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 2>You can do heal hooks at purple belt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>

977
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.970
<v Speaker 2>White Belt and blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No heel hooks.</v>

978
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 2>You can do straight ankle and knee bars</v>
<v Speaker 2>at blue enough.</v>

979
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.730
<v Speaker 2>No legs at all at white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero legs at White,</v>

980
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>straight ankle locks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee bars,</v>

981
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 2>leg compression at blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they allow heel hooks for</v>

982
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 2>reaping everything purple belt on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the best rules.</v>

983
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I love those ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need heel hooks for blue</v>

984
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 2>belts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like Naga,</v>

985
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>they let everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll hook so,</v>

986
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's not this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

987
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 2>big epidemic going on where people are</v>

<v Speaker 2>knee injury,</v>

990
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 2>just like they do get an arm injury or</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder injury.</v>

991
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people get put on a heel hook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a there any up sometimes,</v>

992
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:30.110

<v Speaker 2>the same rate.</v>

993

<v Speaker 2>We do heal hooks all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting every now and then</v>

1037
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:34.790
<v Speaker 6>and hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the rules that you've set up for</v>

1038
00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:38.450
<v Speaker 6>Ebi are the best rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're the rules because you go a</v>

1039
00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:39.890
<v Speaker 6>certain amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

1040
00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:40.724
<v Speaker 6>Ten minutes,</v>

1041
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 2>10 minute match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 Man Tournament,</v>

1042
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 2>a 10 minute matches with overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was no points,</v>

1043
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:48.760
<v Speaker 2>no advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All submission.</v>

1044
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Only like you'd have to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>submission,</v>

1045
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:50.874
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 6>What's really interesting is you've got</v>
<v Speaker 6>this idea that uh,</v>

1047
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>until I saw it,</v>

1048
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 6>I was not sure what to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1049
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:59.080
<v Speaker 6>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1050
00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how it was going to do this</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other time.</v>

1051
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 6>Over time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sounds crazy.</v>

1052
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.790
<v Speaker 6>It sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in practice it's the best thing.</v>

1053
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 6>Since if you watch a Jujitsu match,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that happens if you're</v>

1054
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 6>a casual observer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you watch like a Marcello Garcia,</v>

1055
00:46:12.511 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 6>some guy just attacks and strangle</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody like,</v>

1056
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was amazing.</v>

1057
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.400
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy's awesome.</v>

1058
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.360
<v Speaker 6>Like I've showed some people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever do Jujitsu.</v>

1059
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 6>I showed them Marcello Garcia match and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you watch him choke somebody and it's so</v>

1060
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 6>spectacular to watch because his</v>
<v Speaker 6>movements are so impressive.</v>

1061
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:29.700
<v Speaker 6>There's whole fast and lethal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1062
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of Jujitsu matches will end in</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

1063
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 6>Some guy gets on top and then he</v>
<v Speaker 6>reverses the guy.</v>

1064
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 6>Guy Used to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It goes for a leg lock,</v>

1065
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't get it and God goes to choke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't get it.</v>

1066
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 6>The other guy winds up on top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They reverse positions and you run out</v>

1067
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 6>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you run out of time like that,</v>

1068
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 6>for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>feel is inconclusive.</v>

1069
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 6>So you decide you're going to have how</v>
<v Speaker 6>many different rounds of it did they do?</v>

1070
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.170
<v Speaker 6>Four rounds?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the most amount of rounds of</v>

1071
00:46:53.171 --> 00:46:53.710
<v Speaker 6>overtime?</v>

1072
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first off,</v>

1073
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.750
<v Speaker 2>let me say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1074
00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's nothing wrong with the point</v>

1075
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.420
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like the plank game,</v>

1076
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking nothing and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at it.</v>

1077
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:05.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get good at passing and</v>

1078
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:08.870
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get good at sweeping and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrestling is going to be good.</v>

1079
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

1080
00:47:10.791 --> 00:47:13.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a subculture,</v>

1081
00:47:13.731 --> 00:47:16.190
<v Speaker 2>cerebral type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Positional thing,</v>

1082
00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could use that as a training tool,</v>

1083
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.240
<v Speaker 2>like getting good at points tournaments</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you're going to work on,</v>

1084
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 2>you're passing and you're sweeping and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well do points</v>

1085
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.170
<v Speaker 2>lethal with punches and you</v>

1086
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 6>like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a bad strategy.</v>

1087
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.230
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to stomp that out.</v>

1088
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to compete against that</v>

1089
00:47:39.021 --> 00:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful thing.</v>

1090
00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.500
<v Speaker 2>What you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

1091
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:47.300
<v Speaker 2>My goal has always been to put a to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a Jujitsu show and I thought it</v>

1092
00:47:47.301 --> 00:47:51.560
<v Speaker 2>would have been done by now and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have tried to put a Jujitsu show</v>

1093
00:47:51.561 --> 00:47:54.920
<v Speaker 2>together on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so exciting that it can compete</v>

1094
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:59.720
<v Speaker 2>with on the overall entertainment value</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an nma show like your average mma</v>

1095
00:47:59.721 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to just so,</v>

1096
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.550
<v Speaker 2>so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were obsessed with it.</v>

1097
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we see what's going wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1098
00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:09.980
<v Speaker 2>There's been a professional submission</v>
<v Speaker 2>league,</v>

1099
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hicks and even had a show there.</v>

1100
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Metamorris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Polaris.</v>

1101
00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of these shows,</v>

1102
00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.590
<v Speaker 2>including mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including mine.</v>

1103
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.750
<v Speaker 2>None of these shows are making any</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1104
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I haven't made any goddamn money with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1105
00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.400
<v Speaker 2>We all know that in the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>community there's,</v>

1106
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no money there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shows fail constantly,</v>

1107
00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:30.200
<v Speaker 2>but what is it about works of passion</v>

1108
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.760
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you go to an Ebi and you're in the</v>

1109
00:48:34.761 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 6>audience that has an audience of Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 6>enthusiasts,</v>

1110
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.820
<v Speaker 6>like everybody is pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're all very excited to be there.</v>

1111
00:48:40.821 --> 00:48:45.110
<v Speaker 6>And there's a feeling of comradery in</v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of a crowd that's very</v>

1112
00:48:45.111 --> 00:48:48.260
<v Speaker 6>different than a crowd that just comes</v>
<v Speaker 6>out to see like a UFC.</v>

1113
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.250
<v Speaker 6>Because a lot of people in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 6>at a UFC are gigantic fans.</v>

1114
00:48:52.251 --> 00:48:55.040
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them are fucking fanatical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them are like you and me.</v>

1115
00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.650
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's a lot of other people that</v>

1116
00:48:57.651 --> 00:49:00.050
<v Speaker 6>are just there because it's an event.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of other people that goes</v>

1117
00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:02.120
<v Speaker 6>there because it's a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that are on</v>

1118
00:49:02.121 --> 00:49:04.610
<v Speaker 6>their phone and half the time they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even paying attention to the fights.</v>

1119
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.300
<v Speaker 6>This is that to add an Ebi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because none of that shit.</v>

1120
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.260
<v Speaker 6>You freaks and everybody's clapping for</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

1121
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:15.650
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows when a heel hooks close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows when a choke is closed.</v>

1122
00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:17.210
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows what's going on.</v>

1123
00:49:17.211 --> 00:49:19.070
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows when you guys sent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's up at triangle.</v>

1124
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's a beauty to that.</v>

1125
00:49:21.441 --> 00:49:23.540
<v Speaker 6>But let me explain what you do because</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't finish it.</v>

1126
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.600
<v Speaker 6>You have overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when a fight goes to a draw,</v>

1127
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.700
<v Speaker 6>like at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the time runs out,</v>

1128
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.510
<v Speaker 6>will you do is you take these guys and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you forced them into dangerous</v>

1129
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 6>positions?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:37.730
<v Speaker 6>So you force a guy on a guy's back with</v>
<v Speaker 6>over under and you start from there,</v>

1131
00:49:37.731 --> 00:49:39.200
<v Speaker 6>you say ready,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

1132
00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.930
<v Speaker 6>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then the guy on the bottom tries to get</v>

1133
00:49:41.931 --> 00:49:43.760
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy in the top in the good position</v>

1134
00:49:43.761 --> 00:49:45.950
<v Speaker 6>tries to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the guy finishes,</v>

1135
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.770
<v Speaker 6>you move on to the to another round and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other guy tries to do it.</v>

1136
00:49:48.771 --> 00:49:52.550
<v Speaker 6>If he can't finish them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy who finished one but he gets his</v>

1137
00:49:52.551 --> 00:49:57.470
<v Speaker 6>chance in a bad position as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you have a stalemate over the</v>

1138
00:49:57.471 --> 00:50:00.830
<v Speaker 6>rounds of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just count out the time who got out</v>

1139
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.500
<v Speaker 6>the quickest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which guy escaped from the other guy's</v>

1140
00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:06.440
<v Speaker 6>bad positions the quickest and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>calculate the time.</v>

1141
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Well traditionally it overtime with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu matches it usually when it came</v>

1142
00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:14.990
<v Speaker 2>down to wrestling who had the better</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling because if there would be</v>

1143
00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:16.520
<v Speaker 2>overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no points or whatever.</v>

1144
00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:20.630
<v Speaker 2>They go into overtime as three minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime and overtime or sudden death,</v>

1145
00:50:20.631 --> 00:50:23.600
<v Speaker 2>whoever gets the first points when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really gonna come down to who has the</v>

1146
00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:25.910
<v Speaker 2>best Ruslan [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all that overtime period.</v>

1147
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 2>They both start on their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the most,</v>

1148
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing on your feet as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrestling here?</v>

1149
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna.</v>

1150
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Determine overall the superior wrestlers</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going,</v>

1151
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always been the case really in</v>

1152
00:50:38.581 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 2>all the overtime is it always comes down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the wrestling generally.</v>

1153
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So I never really was a fan of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've seen plenty of wrestlers</v>

1154
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 2>and submission tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not know anything about submitting,</v>

1155
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 2>but they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll run away with the gold medal</v>

1156
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 2>just based on the wrestling.</v>

1157
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had that wrestling,</v>

1158
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 2>but when it's a submission or a Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>tournament,</v>

1159
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.900
<v Speaker 2>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best Jujitsu should win.</v>

1160
00:51:01.901 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Not the best wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arresting the best Jujitsu,</v>

1161
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best it's submitting should win.</v>

1162
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like Marcella Garcia should</v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

1163
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.980
<v Speaker 2>The overtime's should make it so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best wins who generally.</v>

1164
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1165
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 2>instead of starting on the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my overtime rounds,</v>

1166
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 2>we start in terrible positions like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like extra innings you get out</v>

1167
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 2>of like if we were going to add it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went into overtime,</v>

1168
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you'd get a shot at my back and then I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a shot at your bank.</v>

1169
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.540
<v Speaker 2>If you've finished me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not over yet.</v>

1170
00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I get a shot at gear back by finish you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We die,</v>

1171
00:51:31.731 --> 00:51:35.210
<v Speaker 2>we go an extra ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an extra round three MACs,</v>

1172
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 2>three MACs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could end that first round.</v>

1173
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 2>It could end in the second round if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes all three rounds and we're still</v>

1174
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:43.500
<v Speaker 2>tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's to submission,</v>

1175
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 2>a submission each or an escape each and</v>
<v Speaker 2>another escape.</v>

1176
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:51.641
<v Speaker 2>And it's three total or all escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We add all the combined escape and</v>

1177
00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 2>submission times together and whoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the quickest or shortest time winds.</v>

1178
00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 2>So it encourages that when you're on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>back that I'm not going to just sit</v>

1179
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 2>there and just hold the choke out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should try to get the fuck out</v>

1180
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 2>because if this goes to a triple</v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime,</v>

1181
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it does is it opens up a</v>

1182
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 2>submission for the gas because gas</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

1183
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's.</v>

1184
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.860
<v Speaker 3>If it's confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>

1185
00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:17.140
<v Speaker 3>You can go see it live on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see it on Youtube,</v>

1186
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:19.060

1187

<v Speaker 3>That's where we're at.</v>

1188
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.490
<v Speaker 3>We're the ones that you have now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are some matches online.</v>

1189
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 3>If somebody wanted to go and look at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1190
00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:25.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1191
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And then the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next one,</v>

1192
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:29.650
<v Speaker 3>the absolute one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This big crazy one is going to be in</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when did they build that?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to watch your show there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like last time we were there,</v>

1212
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:14.900
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting in the audience like,</v>

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1216
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:24.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's always been done without my</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner Victor Divey like he's the one</v>

1217
00:53:24.131 --> 00:53:25.110
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the.</v>

1218
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to be a promoter man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not something I ever ever thought</v>

1219
00:53:28.621 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd ever be like a promoter for a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I was trying to do.</v>

1220
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to come up with an idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

1221
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 2>give it to another promoter to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do this,</v>

1222
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thought it was the dumbest idea</v>

1223
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>they thought I was losing my mind when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put.</v>

1224
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:43.200
<v Speaker 2>They thought I smoked too much weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

1225
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1226
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to do it.</v>

1227
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And Victor Vic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem was it was too much</v>

1228
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked into it,</v>

1229
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this shit.</v>

1230
00:53:52.331 --> 00:53:53.164
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

1231
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.600
<v Speaker 2>But victor came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victor Davi,</v>

1232
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 2>he's the Spanish commentator for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

1233
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Came up to me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1234
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.480
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me do all the work years.</v>

1235
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.720
<v Speaker 2>It'll be your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1236
00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 2>you run the show as an executive</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer,</v>

1237
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.590
<v Speaker 2>let me produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make it all happen.</v>

1238
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he makes it really easy for me.</v>

1239
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>He does all like when you walked in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the stage,</v>

1240
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything to do with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient in production.</v>

1241
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean working on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows a lot of shit and he's such a</v>

1242

<v Speaker 2>good dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's one of my greatest friends ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he helps.</v>

1263
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 2>He's a an Ebi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm associate producer.</v>

1264
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Did he broke his arm training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1265
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't crash.</v>

1266
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm drawn.</v>

1267
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crushed with scary.</v>

1268
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:20.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of our favorite bone</v>

1269
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1270
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 2>You rarely see it in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:27.300
<v Speaker 2>rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unusual.</v>

1272
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you saw a bicep</v>

1273
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 2>crushed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think George Sada Roblis did it.</v>

1274
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Did I think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back back in the day when we used to</v>

1275
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:38.590
<v Speaker 2>work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he did it on a George Group.</v>

1276
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the names all mixed up,</v>

1277
00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy sport man.</v>

1278
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing crazier than MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you watch the combination of</v>

1279
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.850
<v Speaker 2>punching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking and you're seeing,</v>

1280
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing a lot more guys go for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg locks.</v>

1281
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Now notice that you have seen there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy,</v>

1282
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 2>he didn't pull anything off though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but forget he was,</v>

1283
00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:04.520
<v Speaker 2>but he was all over dude's legs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1284
00:56:04.521 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>But then he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get hit and a lot of angles,</v>

1285
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back you talking about,</v>

1286
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um.</v>

1287
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Was it a Darren Elkins fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe?</v>

1288
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1289
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.030
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was he fighting?</v>

1290
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

1291
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 2>It was a great fight for Elkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't,</v>

1292
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 2>why can't I remember who the hell he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting too many people.</v>

1293
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And that last card this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1294
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.590
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad skelly.</v>

1295
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I think Chaz was like foreign one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC and Elkins is dominated them.</v>

1296
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Elkins move to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>

1297
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Sacramento train with Alpha male moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family.</v>

1298
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Said fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make a run at that fight that</v>

1299
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1301
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 1>he and Elkins just grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounded him.</v>

1302
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple times where he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going for elkins legs,</v>

1303
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but elkins just grounded cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're gonna see a lot more leg</v>

1304
00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 1>locks down the hall and there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>

1305
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could punch a guy in,</v>

1306
00:56:57.411 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his face or not.</v>

1307
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Hall take you.</v>

1308
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Get laid off real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody's aware too,</v>

1309
00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:07.600
<v Speaker 1>of the trend in Jujitsu and Gary Tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about,</v>

1310
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's going to do mma.</v>

1311
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It's strange seeing Ryan Hall in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1312
00:57:13.261 --> 00:57:15.130
<v Speaker 1>it's strange because he's always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jujitsu guy,</v>

1313
00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:15.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1314
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we would do the man he's in there</v>

1315
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 1>now and he's throwing down and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making some waves.</v>

1316
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin is going to be really</v>

1317
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.790
<v Speaker 1>interesting because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been striking for quite a while,</v>

1318
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 1>like really trying to tighten it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really working on getting that in order.</v>

1319
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to jump into anything</v>

1320
00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 1>like Kinda halfassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll have his striking in order for you</v>

1321
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:36.320
<v Speaker 1>as his first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get some blocks.</v>

1322
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1323
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And we'll get a lot of chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get all everything he says he's a</v>

1324
00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and only getting better.</v>

1325
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the MMA fighters are always</v>

1326
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:48.040
<v Speaker 1>aware of trends.</v>

1327
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the big trend in Jujitsu,</v>

1328
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:52.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're not going to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to that.</v>

1329
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously a leg lock bias going</v>

1330
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:57.550
<v Speaker 1>on right now in Jujitsu where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>training that really heavily.</v>

1331
00:57:57.551 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 1>They realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of people kind</v>

1332
00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.880
<v Speaker 1>of knew leg locks and we're good at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>locks,</v>

1333
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:09.150
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like once Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and that crew got involved in it,</v>

1334
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it became like a whole new level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity when it comes to Lego blocks.</v>

1335
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Danaher's crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin,</v>

1336
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Eddie come into now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon Ryan.</v>

1337
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:23.480
<v Speaker 1>He just got his black belt from tonin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that all started.</v>

1338
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.570
<v Speaker 1>That all started from Dean lister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1339
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister went down a hens those for a</v>

1340
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hung out with Danaher,</v>

1341
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 1>showed them on a lot of leg luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1342
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it probably lagged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked a lot of the upper level guys and</v>

1343
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.140
<v Speaker 1>made an impression.</v>

1344
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.330
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Danaher being like,</v>

1345
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a astrophysicist.</v>

1346
00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably took that shit.</v>

1347
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 1>The Dean lister told him and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1348
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.030
<v Speaker 1>just blew it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a wizard and just added so</v>

1349
00:58:52.031 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>much stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Eddie coming to super smart</v>

1350
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.470
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's taken all the Shit Danner showed</v>

1351
00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:59.730
<v Speaker 1>him and he's adding a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it all onto gary telling her and</v>

1352
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Gary told him he already had rear naked</v>
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>

1353
00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 1>She already had great defense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just did a solid as fuck.</v>

1354
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 1>He added leg locks over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and now fuck is the fucking.</v>

1355
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear something even crazier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

1356
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I go to donner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1357
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.730
<v Speaker 1>how did Eddie coming to hurt his leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1358
00:59:15.731 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's was rolling with some of the other</v>

1359
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 1>students that we have in the gym that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a little bit more advanced in</v>

1360
00:59:20.831 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 1>him with leg locks.</v>

1361
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.720
<v Speaker 1>They just don't use them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't.</v>

1362
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1363
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:27.740
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got guys in your gym that don't</v>

1364
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:29.420
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are better than any companies that</v>

1365
00:59:29.421 --> 00:59:31.800
<v Speaker 1>lead locks and that was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1366
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how scary that is.</v>

1367
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.851
<v Speaker 1>But the way he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

1368
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Donna Harris says it very definitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we have guys that are maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more advanced than him.</v>

1370
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two kinds of games now,</v>

1371
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:50.030
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that because you can shut down a</v>

1372
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:54.530
<v Speaker 1>leg lock game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta have a solid clenching top</v>

1373
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 1>heavy game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have that slow smashing,</v>

1374
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>destroying game to stop those lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the best at stopping leg locks</v>

1375
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>right now with our game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1376
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>when I'd have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1377
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the best is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>

1378
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Abu Dhabi,</v>

1379
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Lucas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre Lucas Le Prix,</v>

1380
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 1>he went against Gary Tone and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1381
01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just hit him with the straight meet,</v>

1382
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>caused me cut paths with that under hook</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just didn't finish them,</v>

1383
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>but he stayed out of leg locked danger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anyone on points one was,</v>

1384
01:00:27.861 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>this was last year was last year.</v>

1385
01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1386
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>technically he be Gary Tone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically he avoided all the shit.</v>

1387
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Smash them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he passes guard may have even</v>

1388
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>took his back even to tell you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1389
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>

1390
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:44.143
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1391
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless though he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1392
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1393
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>that's one kind of game right there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he for sure it wasn't going to</v>

1394
01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>start playing leg locks with character</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1395
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.283
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1396
01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>he knew the game was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to stay away from that shit.</v>

1397
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa know how to stay away and</v>

1398
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be able to put some heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>on someone's leg locks.</v>

1399
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>You gotta know how to get out of Lego</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks.</v>

1400
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>If you're not working leg locks all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn time,</v>

1401
01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be so far behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really,</v>

1402
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole new world growing out</v>

1403
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1404
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And in the sub only world submission</v>
<v Speaker 1>only community if it's,</v>

1405
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know leg locks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she will never survive in an</v>

1406
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never survive.</v>

1407
01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So it go back just to when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing in the tournament as a white</v>

1408
01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>belt and people screaming and bullying</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going for a leg lock,</v>

1409
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine what it's like today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 16.</v>

1410
01:01:36.411 --> 01:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw this coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's still tons of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike lock still.</v>

1412
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>There still are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still a Jujitsu instructors out there</v>

1414
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>posting the anti leg lock stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem is?</v>

1415
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the legs are the strongest muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body,</v>

1416
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legs are attached to the longest</v>

1417
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>limbs you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can move them in ways that you can</v>

1418
01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>never move your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize how limited your arms are</v>

1419
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're not using your legs to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>after legs and to hold positions.</v>

1420
01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You realize like how it's kind of silly</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost to use your arms as opposed to</v>

1421
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>most of the community looks at it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a negative way.</v>

1422
01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have.</v>

1423
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>You have a whole nother game to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

1424
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole nother game.</v>

1425
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to learn the whole new</v>

1426
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:22.730
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1427
01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get really good at one thing.</v>

1428
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 3>They get really good at one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they want to stick with that shift.</v>

1429
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what you got to get</v>

1430
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:30.040
<v Speaker 3>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing though,</v>

1431
01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 3>that the very thing that made you Jitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>so popular in the first place was that</v>

1432
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 3>it had figured out a way to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>something the most technically</v>

1433
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:39.720
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a small guy,</v>

1434
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 3>like hoists can be a big guy like Dan</v>
<v Speaker 3>severn like and it was the using the</v>

1435
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:46.980
<v Speaker 3>techniques that work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then these new techniques at work,</v>

1436
01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:47.814
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1437
01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to stick to the old.</v>

1438
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.790
<v Speaker 3>The old ones like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1439
01:02:52.791 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got to figure out how to defend</v>

1440
01:02:54.751 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 3>against these blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get them out of the boys.</v>

1441
01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's work this through kickbox and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1442
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 3>That's never going to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there a lot of trends.</v>

1443
01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a point in time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people weren't throwing any head kicks.</v>

1444
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.870
<v Speaker 3>Deemed Lester's going to do this next</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one wants to be.</v>

1525
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to be paired up with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1526
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really good too.</v>

1527
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So passing is getting spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how long I like that can</v>

1528
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.820

1532
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>He used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't used to pass as much.</v>

1533
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>You should just throw people around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on top of malaria,</v>

1534
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>but now he's really good at passing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finishing.</v>

1535
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Now we got to Lucas roadshow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

1544
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>

1549
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Like 10th planet wasn't even playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm 32 years old.</v>

1550
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know nothing about no 10 planet.</v>

1551
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.220
<v Speaker 1>How crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 32,</v>

1552
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is it that we were like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>love with that Zechariah's hitching guys</v>

1553
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>books now they think they might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually found this planet.</v>

1554
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that for real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1555
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't even pay attention to that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no photographs of it,</v>

1556
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:02.890
<v Speaker 1>but they were pretty sure to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're stepping out and saying</v>

1557
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:07.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a large planet probably about</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times the size of earth that's</v>

1558
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.600
<v Speaker 1>outside of our theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1559
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:10.930
<v Speaker 1>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

1560
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Now it's mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists are saying this.</v>

1561
01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I think Tyson is addressed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People keep sending me shit,</v>

1562
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1563
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to.</v>

1564
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Jamie will pull it up for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

1566
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Eddie turned me onto this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1567
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever heard her is extra Zacharias</v>

1568
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>hitchin and we got so deep ways to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>bong hits her and and talk about the</v>

1569
01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Annunaki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched documentaries on it.</v>

1570
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy stripper told me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1571
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.030
<v Speaker 1>do you know that we used in mind world</v>
<v Speaker 1>for gold?</v>

1572
01:08:40.031 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gina,</v>

1573
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because why do you think we like gold so</v>

1574
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to be slaves and like,</v>

1575
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:48.740
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought she was the craziest</v>

1576
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>person ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about it for five</v>

1577
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make music with her and I'm</v>

1578
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:53.391
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1579
01:08:53.391 --> 01:08:58.391
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of weird that the one fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing we all agree on is a gold is money</v>

1580
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 1>has to one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all agree on nothing else.</v>

1581
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Then I asked Regina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is this guy who told,</v>

1582
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:08.180
<v Speaker 1>told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you about this,</v>

1583
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.730
<v Speaker 1>what is this guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she gave me his name.</v>

1584
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I called him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1585
01:09:11.991 --> 01:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gina's friend.</v>

1586
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.650
<v Speaker 1>She said you were talking about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy motherfucker who,</v>

1587
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 1>who wrote books about a us being slaves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit because Oh yeah,</v>

1588
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:24.520
<v Speaker 1>some guy named will to a situation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zacharias itching.</v>

1589
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.071
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1590
01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote it down that I looked into</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that's how.</v>

1591
01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 1>This is all pre internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a sheet that 99 slash 2000,</v>

1592
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>2000 you had the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was harder to find shit back</v>

1593
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ninth planet does it exist a 10,000</v>

1594
01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:44.000
<v Speaker 1>year orbit in outer reaches of our solar</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1595
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to figure it out right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1596
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they believe is,</v>

1597
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been believing this for awhile</v>

1598
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.160
<v Speaker 1>as it apparently there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the reason why they declassified</v>

1599
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:57.170
<v Speaker 1>pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it is on a planet anymore.</v>

1600
01:09:57.171 --> 01:10:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It's because Pluto is a large body in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kuyper belt.</v>

1601
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:05.830
<v Speaker 1>The kuiper belt is a belt of just large</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids and round things and shit</v>

1602
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:09.740
<v Speaker 1>floating around out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird because the photos</v>

1603
01:10:09.741 --> 01:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>of Pluto that they've released recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really up close photos they just</v>

1604
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>

1605
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're nitpicking here,</v>

1606
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a goddamn planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't think it's big enough to</v>

1607
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:20.564
<v Speaker 1>be a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1608
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it looks like a fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the photos of Pluto.</v>

1609
01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>The newest food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amazing.</v>

1610
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1611
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1612
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it's like it's there,</v>

1613
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:30.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

1614
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 1>You call it a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You call her dwarf you call,</v>

1615
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>they call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think they're going to call it a</v>

1616
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:34.670
<v Speaker 1>dwarf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what you call it?</v>

1618
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like,</v>

1619
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never existed.</v>

1620
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1621
01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a body of mass data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they think is that there's so many</v>

1622
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:46.160
<v Speaker 1>of these out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found another one.</v>

1623
01:10:46.161 --> 01:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I were at a bar having a drink</v>

1624
01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:50.350
<v Speaker 1>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1625
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:51.950
<v Speaker 1>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the photos.</v>

1626
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1627
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.690
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some of the photos.</v>

1628
01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I think those are color corrected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show like different things,</v>

1629
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but there's some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1630
01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the actual surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the far right one that you,</v>

1631
01:11:01.731 --> 01:11:03.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>

1632
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1633
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:04.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1634
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:06.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1635
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>There was some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some from the far right.</v>

1636
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>One that's Pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that looks like the,</v>

1637
01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>the ones from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All images right</v>

1638
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Pluto.</v>

1639
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 3>The one down below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Above Planet X.</v>

1640
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.890
<v Speaker 3>That's moon though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different planets on</v>

1642
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 3>this earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moon</v>

1643
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.200
<v Speaker 4>squared.</v>

1644
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Google search though,</v>

1645
01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just go to go to the web,</v>

1646
01:11:32.271 --> 01:11:36.980
<v Speaker 3>search the web search and then just</v>
<v Speaker 3>write recent photos of Pluto.</v>

1647
01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.490
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Cassini?</v>

1648
01:11:39.491 --> 01:11:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took the photographs.</v>

1649
01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.080
<v Speaker 3>What was the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cassini.</v>

1650
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So there's a bunch of Pluto says what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>

1651
01:11:45.341 --> 01:11:45.791
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:47.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they found another one.</v>

1653
01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:51.040
<v Speaker 3>You and I were at a bar once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember this because I saw it on my</v>

1654
01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:52.690
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it had to be an iphone.</v>

1655
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone had sent this to me.</v>

1656
01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta check this out.</v>

1657
01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I clicked on the link and went to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>website that showed that there was a new</v>

1658
01:11:58.541 --> 01:11:59.620
<v Speaker 3>planet and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1659
01:11:59.621 --> 01:12:02.560
<v Speaker 3>they found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it turned out it was right before</v>

1660
01:12:02.561 --> 01:12:04.690
<v Speaker 3>they declassified pullo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went,</v>

1661
01:12:04.691 --> 01:12:06.610
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of these fucking things</v>

1662
01:12:06.611 --> 01:12:07.960
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These aren't really planets,</v>

1663
01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:10.750
<v Speaker 3>and so they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a long story short,</v>

1664
01:12:10.751 --> 01:12:14.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of these things out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and then behind that is a thing</v>

1665
01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.070
<v Speaker 3>called the galactic shelf where it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>drops off and that would indicate that</v>

1666
01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

1667
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.720
<v Speaker 3>large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive object out there,</v>

1668
01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:23.554
<v Speaker 3>another planet.</v>

1669
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:25.400
<v Speaker 3>What if they like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing there,</v>

1670
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:29.050
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that's this blackness</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have like,</v>

1671
01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:31.060
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really what's out there,</v>

1672
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like scientists.</v>

1673
01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The astronomers,</v>

1674
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.310
<v Speaker 3>they have some pretty insane fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>telescopes now.</v>

1675
01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:37.990
<v Speaker 3>They can see some wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild shit.</v>

1676
01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.030
<v Speaker 3>They've identified hundreds of planets</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1677
01:12:40.031 --> 01:12:43.390
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird because just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>decade or so ago they hadn't identified</v>

1678
01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 3>any outside of our solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only a hundred seats.</v>

1679
01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1680
01:12:48.641 --> 01:12:50.250
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

1681
01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Look at the surface of that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1682
01:12:51.971 --> 01:12:54.670
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take a picture of Pluto.</v>

1683
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at it.</v>

1684
01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.440
<v Speaker 3>That is a circular round thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like a planet.</v>

1685
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever nitpicky that that's not a</v>

1686
01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:05.860
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because there's a gang of those out</v>

1687
01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:06.580
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1688
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a gang of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how many there are.</v>

1689
01:13:08.831 --> 01:13:09.940
<v Speaker 3>They're going to find new ones.</v>

1690
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>This kaiper belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of little tiny objects</v>

1691
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:19.010
<v Speaker 3>out there that are like Pluto size</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller than Pluto and I think they</v>

1692
01:13:19.011 --> 01:13:22.520
<v Speaker 3>assume that they're going to find more</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this object,</v>

1693
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:24.920
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's outside outside.</v>

1694
01:13:24.921 --> 01:13:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Like in the 10,000 year orbit around</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth is big way bigger than us.</v>

1695
01:13:28.941 --> 01:13:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Four times outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those little side,</v>

1696
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:35.580
<v Speaker 3>all the little ones that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's apparently there's a dropoff,</v>

1697
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:38.200
<v Speaker 3>there's like the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be butchering this and if I am,</v>

1698
01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I've read and try to remember</v>

1699
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.780
<v Speaker 3>was that there is something called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>galactic shelf and that would indicate</v>

1700
01:13:44.781 --> 01:13:49.550
<v Speaker 3>something that has a lot of mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that has a lot of gravity,</v>

1701
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:53.110
<v Speaker 3>something that's big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they think it's bigger than.</v>

1702
01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying it's four times the size</v>

1703
01:13:55.221 --> 01:13:56.600
<v Speaker 3>of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so something really big.</v>

1704
01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1705
01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.550
<v Speaker 3>It's just nuts to think there's another</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet out there</v>

1706
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:08.540
<v Speaker 3>and what's even more not says what if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's fucking life forms on it.</v>

1707
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.840
<v Speaker 3>What if this thing in this 10,000 orbit</v>
<v Speaker 3>around Earth is heated by its core would</v>

1708
01:14:15.231 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 3>have it gets its heat instead of from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun would have.</v>

1709
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:21.880
<v Speaker 3>It gets its heat internally and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>life forces are all from an internally.</v>

1710
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's where the auto Nakia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if that was a real story.</v>

1711
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Imagine this Annunaki thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody laughs at it.</v>

1712
01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thinks it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like when the 10,000 years rolls</v>

1713
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that motherfucker gets close.</v>

1714
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.530
<v Speaker 3>They really are a bunch of aliens living</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that thing.</v>

1715
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:39.364
<v Speaker 3>Who made us.</v>

1716
01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Could you fucking imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing would ever mean anything.</v>

1717
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your credit cards,</v>

1718
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 3>how much gas is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would give a fuck.</v>

1719
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.000
<v Speaker 3>It would all be so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back of your mind.</v>

1720
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Everything would be in the back of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind except,</v>

1721
01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a planet out there is a bunch of</v>

1722
01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:02.380
<v Speaker 3>fucking people who made us out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkeys.</v>

1723
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 3>They came down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did genetic engineering experiments</v>

1724
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 3>on monkeys just like we would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like we would do if we,</v>

1725
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.610
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've found some planet in outer space,</v>

1726
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:18.330
<v Speaker 3>especially if we were like scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were like thousands of years</v>

1727
01:15:20.201 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 3>removed from us today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like way,</v>

1728
01:15:22.211 --> 01:15:22.871
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1729
01:15:22.871 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way in the future.</v>

1730
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe millions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a million years more evolved.</v>

1731
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 3>They look at these monkeys like we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get help them out here to help them</v>

1732
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:30.790
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know where this is going.</v>

1733
01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just grabbed them.</v>

1734
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Shoot some fucking woman where her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be the greatest thing to</v>

1735
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 3>experience ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what could you imagine how earth</v>

1736
01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:47.821
<v Speaker 3>shattering it would be if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real life form from another planet that</v>

1737
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:51.370
<v Speaker 3>we could absolutely identify a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and they were super</v>

1738
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.140
<v Speaker 3>advanced and they were coming by to</v>
<v Speaker 3>visit</v>

1739
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1740
01:15:56.070 --> 01:16:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I'd have some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what,</v>

1741
01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.800
<v Speaker 2>what we're inside of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just.</v>

1742
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1743
01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:15.051
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens and space is man,</v>

1744
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:18.250
<v Speaker 2>remember how we were so into him like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1745
01:16:18.251 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 2>in the late 90 [inaudible] or the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>two thousands.</v>

1746
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Aliens were like fucking always on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1747
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because the history channel</v>

1748
01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:30.180
<v Speaker 2>killed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ancient aliens.</v>

1749
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was the plan all along is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what,</v>

1750
01:16:33.781 --> 01:16:37.230
<v Speaker 2>let's kill this whole fucking alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement by putting it on history</v>

1751
01:16:37.231 --> 01:16:42.070
<v Speaker 2>channel over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is called me up?</v>

1752
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you called me up once.</v>

1753
01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:46.020
<v Speaker 2>He was a hilarious conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to.</v>

1754
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not in a fucking aliens</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1755
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:57.710
<v Speaker 2>History Channel clucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cool was that?</v>

1756
01:16:58.471 --> 01:17:01.350
<v Speaker 2>First Season of ancient aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1757
01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to mainstream and</v>

1758
01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:06.750
<v Speaker 2>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome,</v>

1759
01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:08.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they did another season.</v>

1760
01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Just ran out of shit to</v>

1761
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.230
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately they special.</v>

1762
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>You just start off as a special maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1763
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Then it turned into a series of fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those first funds are awesome.</v>

1764
01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

1765
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:24.980
<v Speaker 1>What was the last time we talked to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you talked to him in a while?</v>

1766
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about the overall industry is</v>

1767
01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 1>kinda down like he got upset when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

1768
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think about some of the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that,</v>

1769
01:17:34.621 --> 01:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is just to bullshitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too.</v>

1770
01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was aliens,</v>

1771
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.270
<v Speaker 1>like I'll come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1772
01:17:41.271 --> 01:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>They went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're selling.</v>

1773
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.790
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain amount of that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is absolutely fascinating.</v>

1775
01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.520
<v Speaker 6>When you look at some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1776
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:54.150
<v Speaker 6>depictions of like aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like the Egyptians used to do.</v>

1777
01:17:54.151 --> 01:17:56.300
<v Speaker 6>They used to make like these little</v>
<v Speaker 6>model aircraft,</v>

1778
01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 1>compelling evidence for you for if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had like a Ufo was a skeptic right here</v>

1779
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and you got like five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your go to?</v>

1780
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing right now.</v>

1781
01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was nothing.</v>

1782
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:17.510
<v Speaker 1>There's that one thing you can put</v>
<v Speaker 1>disclosure project all the witnesses and</v>

1783
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:18.260
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.093
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1785
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:23.540
<v Speaker 6>The other mind you just never know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just never know.</v>

1786
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 6>There's all sorts of experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 6>people can have.</v>

1787
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.950
<v Speaker 6>Two that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very unusual weather condition.</v>

1788
01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 6>Things like ball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lightning ball,</v>

1789
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 6>lightning is one that's really crazy</v>
<v Speaker 6>because apparently there's a swamp gas.</v>

1790
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this ball lightning apparently moves</v>

1791
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:44.420
<v Speaker 6>like some alien space craft and</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently if you saw a ball lightning</v>

1792
01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 6>and they've identified it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like this really rare form of</v>

1793
01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 6>lightning that instead of coming down</v>
<v Speaker 6>like really fast,</v>

1794
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a line,</v>

1795
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 6>it can move around and it's the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of idea.</v>

1796
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.860
<v Speaker 6>It's like an electrical charge that</v>
<v Speaker 6>breaks free,</v>

1797
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.851
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1798
01:18:58.851 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm not doing a good job of explaining</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1799
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:05.030
<v Speaker 6>but I've seen videos on and I've seen it</v>
<v Speaker 6>explained and I think if you were flying</v>

1800
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:08.960
<v Speaker 6>around man and you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd probably think that was a Ufo and</v>

1801
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 6>if you saw a lot of the experimental</v>
<v Speaker 6>aircraft that they did,</v>

1802
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 6>I talked about it with schermer before</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got here.</v>

1803
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.830
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a lot of that stuff</v>

1804
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>was just people seeing this shit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1805
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the more,</v>

1806
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the more um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you get into</v>

1807
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:30.970
<v Speaker 1>how I'm fucked up like corporations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how fucked up like we've been for so</v>

1808
01:19:32.211 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you look at aliens like Ah,</v>

1809
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:39.190
<v Speaker 1>they are just as distracting us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want us to pick them up fucking</v>

1810
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1811
01:19:40.821 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a big distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distraction.</v>

1812
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I think people love it.</v>

1813
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it sells.</v>

1814
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>distract us.</v>

1815
01:19:48.921 --> 01:19:51.620
<v Speaker 6>I think it appeals to that archetype and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the things that schermer</v>

1816
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:54.620
<v Speaker 6>talked about before you got here in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier podcast.</v>

1817
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about how it's like for</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people that are atheist,</v>

1818
01:19:58.101 --> 01:20:01.040
<v Speaker 6>that becomes their God and it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>makes sense.</v>

1819
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:01.521
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1820
01:20:01.521 --> 01:20:06.521
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe in fairy tales,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I believe maybe we are created by</v>

1821
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 6>aliens who ran experiments</v>

1822
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 3>on monkeys and they're all written like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can we won't believe the Bible?</v>

1823
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:15.100
<v Speaker 3>But we believed the Sumerian texts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1824
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is too easy question is that we.</v>

1825
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not into the Bible,</v>

1826
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 3>but we're into some with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people were dummies,</v>

1827
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 3>but these people 2000 years before them</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1828
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 3>they had it nailed what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not God's.</v>

1829
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 3>It's aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1830
01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:34.200
<v Speaker 3>They came from another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on the story because an alien</v>

1831
01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:36.040
<v Speaker 3>story actually kind of makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're.</v>

1832
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 3>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in space and shit.</v>

1833
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1834
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I always think of it as would we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would we do it,</v>

1835
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.190
<v Speaker 3>do what would we run experiments on some</v>
<v Speaker 3>life form that we saw on some other</v>

1836
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.980
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1837
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:53.240
<v Speaker 3>what do we do to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monkeys were doing emotional testing</v>

1838
01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>aids medicine on monkeys and shit.</v>

1839
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 3>We would do some weird shit with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkeys from another planet to heal.</v>

1840
01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Probably doing some weird ass shit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this planet.</v>

1841
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.390
<v Speaker 3>We don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1842
01:21:01.391 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's kind of a clone.</v>

1843
01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Humans everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially not in America where you</v>

1844
01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:08.240
<v Speaker 3>don't have any rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you can go to some countries</v>

1845
01:21:08.241 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything like China's started</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing experiments on human embryos,</v>

1846
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:14.540
<v Speaker 3>genetic experiments on human embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raise it men.</v>

1847
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:17.400
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just genetically modified Superman.</v>

1848
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a matter of time before</v>

1849
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:22.830
<v Speaker 3>they do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they can do this genetic engineering</v>

1850
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:25.980
<v Speaker 3>and get through a few generations of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the fact they get the kinks ironed</v>

1851
01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:30.981
<v Speaker 3>out and start making a series of super</v>
<v Speaker 3>along with the Einstein brain.</v>

1852
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if they can have a brain</v>

1853
01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:37.710
<v Speaker 3>beyond Einstein?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could create a human or a clone,</v>

1854
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.880
<v Speaker 3>but you could do something so the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>develops like 10 times stronger and</v>

1855
01:21:41.881 --> 01:21:43.330
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1856
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to read minds and probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

1857
01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when that does happen and we</v>

1858
01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:52.020
<v Speaker 3>see some poor monkey on some other</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet and we've fucking flying around</v>

1859
01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:53.380
<v Speaker 3>out there in space and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fixed.</v>

1860
01:21:53.381 --> 01:21:57.510
<v Speaker 3>That dude skim a little charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just squirt in there and see if he could</v>

1861
01:21:57.511 --> 01:22:00.660
<v Speaker 3>figure it out from here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take that monkey reengineer it,</v>

1862
01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.840
<v Speaker 3>give it a language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It probably would've figured out</v>

1863
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 3>language given enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know they think that chips are</v>

1864
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 3>starting to enter into the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like I was just watching a</v>

1865
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 3>documentary of a monkey and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen those,</v>

1866
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.421
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1867
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:15.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos of monkeys with sticks and they</v>

1868
01:22:15.481 --> 01:22:17.700
<v Speaker 3>using it to eat ants and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching.</v>

1869
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:23.670
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a video of a monkey who</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke off a stick and started banging</v>

1870
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:26.970
<v Speaker 3>the bark to get some money that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the bark,</v>

1871
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 3>but the stick wasn't big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he throws it and he helps him,</v>

1872
01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:33.770
<v Speaker 3>grabs another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbs at all help and then start to.</v>

1873
01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:38.610
<v Speaker 3>He should probably be using that as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapon at this point.</v>

1874
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.140
<v Speaker 3>If he's doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1875
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 3>What happens then when when they learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to use it as a weapon on each other</v>

1876
01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:45.031
<v Speaker 3>and shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1877
01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 3>what's amazing is what if what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing is them learning it.</v>

1878
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.570
<v Speaker 3>What if what we're seeing is like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just starting to observe this</v>

1879
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if in our lifetime they start using</v>

1880
01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:58.170
<v Speaker 3>tools like it seems like that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on because they don't either.</v>

1881
01:22:58.171 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 3>It's one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either they just didn't have enough</v>

1882
01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 3>video of them back then and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have enough people observing them,</v>

1883
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:06.880
<v Speaker 3>but to really realize they've probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>been these tools for 100 years or so,</v>

1884
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 3>or they just started doing it in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>

1885
01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1886
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 3>That could be possible if you ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>snopes.</v>

1887
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Snopes is because I don't know if this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is true.</v>

1888
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:20.710
<v Speaker 3>There's an orangutan that's fishing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spear.</v>

1889
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Speaker 3>He's hanging off of a fucking branch</v>
<v Speaker 3>over this river.</v>

1890
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 3>He needs got a spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a photo of it.</v>

1891
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks so good and it's always one of</v>

1892
01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things I've always</v>

1893
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:35.820
<v Speaker 3>wanted to google it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1894
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to that tomorrow and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>never get to it.</v>

1895
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I got other shit in my life to worry</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1896
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 3>but now these people out these days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember I just remembered I have</v>

1897
01:23:44.981 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 3>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see A.</v>

1898
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Jamie does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it on snopes,</v>

1899
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 3>but it says it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although the eight didn't sufficiently</v>

1900
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 3>didn't develop the skill enough to catch</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

1901
01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show the picture.</v>

1902
01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.270
<v Speaker 3>This is what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1903
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1904
01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 3>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1905
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 3>If this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a goddamn weapon that orangutan</v>

1906
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:10.870
<v Speaker 3>is sticking a long stick into the water.</v>

1907
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1908
01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:17.491
<v Speaker 3>Although ape did not develop sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 3>skill to catch any fish yet he's trends.</v>

1909
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.060
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think he borneo would speed up</v>

1910
01:24:22.061 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 3>that evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1911
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 3>If he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1912
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:27.670
<v Speaker 3>they're probably learning from watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishermen and shit.</v>

1913
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to learn that watery refraction</v>

1914
01:24:30.911 --> 01:24:33.270
<v Speaker 3>thing and that might not be capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing now.</v>

1915
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1916
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Water refraction is.</v>

1917
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a big factor in both fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people with fish,</v>

1918
01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:43.480
<v Speaker 3>with bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at a wall,</v>

1919
01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.170
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if you look down in the water and</v>

1920
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 3>you see like the fish will be where this</v>
<v Speaker 3>laptop is.</v>

1921
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like six inches lower than that,</v>

1922
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 3>but there's this weird refraction thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on because you're looking through</v>

1923
01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:57.790
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like looking through all the</v>

1924
01:24:57.791 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 3>funhouse mirror kind of.</v>

1925
01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:03.220
<v Speaker 3>So you have to learn how to shoot under</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the grant tank might not be able to</v>

1926
01:25:03.221 --> 01:25:04.540
<v Speaker 3>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very smart.</v>

1927
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you figure that out on your own?</v>

1928
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 3>He fucking wizard powerful Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1929
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1930
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:12.610
<v Speaker 3>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how crazy is it?</v>

1931
01:25:12.611 --> 01:25:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Seen him try that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A ranked him by himself with a pole.</v>

1932
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean these not as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like at the circus.</v>

1933
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Nobody taught them that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are smart as fuck,</v>

1934
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:23.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to be a crazy fucking karate</v>

1935
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:26.090
<v Speaker 3>dude who goes out to the jungle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starts Teaching Monkey.</v>

1936
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.500
<v Speaker 3>How do Kendo get them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give them swords and shaky.</v>

1937
01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1938
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Supplied the gorillas with sword,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Samurai swords.</v>

1939
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Bump bump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bump.</v>

1940
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's planet of the apes is not that</v>

1941
01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.100
<v Speaker 3>far off it would it be the teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1942
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Jane Goodall got all evil and shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>started teaching on that fucking cut.</v>

1943
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Jane Goodall believes in bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does she?</v>

1944
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might come back for bigfoot right</v>

1945
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:54.180
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not.</v>

1946
01:25:54.181 --> 01:25:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only just,</v>

1947
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.820
<v Speaker 3>she believes she is certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She cert is talking about a,</v>

1948
01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.010
<v Speaker 3>a pull up Jane Goodall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jane Goodall believes in big.</v>

1949
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:07.550
<v Speaker 3>It's insane when you listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she's way smarter than me and she</v>

1950
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 3>knows way more about primates than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I talk shit.</v>

1951
01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 3>I say I don't think big foot's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be,</v>

1952
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I hear someone as smart as her</v>

1953
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 3>who basically lives in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's in the jungle,</v>

1954
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:22.610
<v Speaker 3>so God damn much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might as well live in the jungle and</v>

1955
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 3>this is what she says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this,</v>

1956
01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.250
<v Speaker 7>not be her talking and we'll see.</v>

1957
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it is</v>

1958
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.760
<v Speaker 7>what you now I know you do wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 7>chimp calls.</v>

1959
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.230
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do the greeting.</v>

1960
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 7>That's the kind of sound you'd hear if</v>
<v Speaker 7>you went to Gombe and you climbed up</v>

1961
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:41.600
<v Speaker 7>onto the ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How long is this video and if you're</v>

1962
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:44.240
<v Speaker 7>lucky you chimpanzee who's calling out</v>
<v Speaker 7>saying,</v>

1963
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 7>here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a wonderful day.</v>

1964
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.113
<v Speaker 7>Where are you?</v>

1965
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:48.890
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>

1966
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:51.000
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>

1967
01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.440
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ooh.</v>

1968
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.060
<v Speaker 7>Each one has his own individual voice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know exactly who's calling.</v>

1969
01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:02.100
<v Speaker 7>Where's bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bro?</v>

1970
01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:03.720
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to probably have to speak with</v>
<v Speaker 7>you</v>

1971
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 7>undiscovered.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about Yeti or big photos.</v>

1972
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.640
<v Speaker 7>Is that what he's talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

1973
01:27:11.641 --> 01:27:14.820
<v Speaker 7>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He is pretty much out of the loop.</v>

1974
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now you will be amazed when I tell you</v>

1975
01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:22.190
<v Speaker 7>that I'm sure that they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've talked to so many native Americans</v>

1976
01:27:22.191 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 7>who've all described the same sound too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who've seen them and there was little</v>

1977
01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 7>tiny snippet in the newspaper just last</v>
<v Speaker 7>week,</v>

1978
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 7>which says the British scientists have</v>
<v Speaker 7>found what they believed to be a Yeti</v>

1979
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 7>hair and that the scientists and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>natural history museum in London</v>

1980
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:40.050
<v Speaker 7>couldn't identify it as any known</v>
<v Speaker 7>animal.</v>

1981
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:42.980
<v Speaker 7>Did you always have this belief that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 7>a romantic,</v>

1982
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:47.220
<v Speaker 7>so I always wanted them to assist</v>
<v Speaker 7>animals.</v>

1983
01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:50.070
<v Speaker 7>Will my passion from even before I could</v>
<v Speaker 7>speak.</v>

1984
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.170
<v Speaker 7>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1985
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.240
<v Speaker 7>a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a couple of people told her that they</v>

1986
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:54.880
<v Speaker 7>solid</v>

1987
01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.030
<v Speaker 3>so</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't see it,</v>

1988
01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.640
<v Speaker 3>but he's been in the jungle for 75</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1989
01:28:00.641 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 3>but that was supposed to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>jungle where she goes,</v>

1990
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is,</v>

1991
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did she say?</v>

1992
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 3>The University of what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1993
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.420
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you could figure out what she</v>

1994
01:28:10.421 --> 01:28:12.730
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what university is that is testing</v>

1995
01:28:12.731 --> 01:28:15.670
<v Speaker 3>a Yeti hair because I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1996
01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I would have heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1997
01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:19.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1998
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was on the Scifi show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tested some stuff.</v>

1999
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.970
<v Speaker 3>We tested hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked with this guy,</v>

2000
01:28:24.971 --> 01:28:26.560
<v Speaker 3>todd desoto from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2001
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm someone big university in New York</v>

2002
01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.500
<v Speaker 3>City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget which one and why you,</v>

2003
01:28:32.501 --> 01:28:33.011
<v Speaker 3>I guess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2004
01:28:33.011 --> 01:28:36.610
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's an Nyu guy and I'm hope I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not wrong todd,</v>

2005
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a geneticist and so we ran tests on</v>

2006
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:47.150
<v Speaker 3>a feces and on hair and the hair was</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear hair and the bear shit too.</v>

2007
01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:52.750
<v Speaker 3>And maybe some dog hairs to give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit got him.</v>

2008
01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.810
<v Speaker 3>He didn't think it was at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2009
01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:55.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2010
01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:58.990
<v Speaker 3>he's dedicated to disproving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was other scientists that gave</v>

2011
01:28:58.991 --> 01:28:59.630
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2012
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 3>that's the one I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what made him think</v>

2016
01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't even agree on what it</v>

<v Speaker 1>also believe in a different kind of big</v>

2036
01:30:06.351 --> 01:30:07.920
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different kind of like a</v>

2037
01:30:07.921 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Christian church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Lutheran.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2039
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:12.980
<v Speaker 1>We believe in bigfoot,</v>

2040
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that one.</v>

01:31:04.111 --> 01:31:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's one you can make fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it,</v>

2058
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.830
<v Speaker 1>if they found big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be like,</v>

2059
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2060
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

2061
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't disbelieve in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

2062
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say it.</v>

2063
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe he isn't or dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2064
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my gut feeling</v>

2065
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:25.280
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2066
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:28.170
<v Speaker 1>you can take your science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day it's all about</v>

2067
01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:29.004
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

2069

<v Speaker 1>no defendant with my life.</v>

2071
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the only fucking answer I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2072
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It's interdimensional press what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

2073
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why they can't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put pig foot on camera,</v>

2074
01:31:44.281 --> 01:31:45.390
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I start going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2076
01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:50.250

<v Speaker 1>Where's the camera or disbelief?</v>

2077
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Just because he doesn't want a closed</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't mean these primitive</v>

2078
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>superintelligent.</v>

2080
01:31:58.081 --> 01:32:00.470
<v Speaker 1>unless you're pure superintelligent.</v>

2081
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to live with the sasquatch</v>

<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a foot,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of dudes who have</v>

2084
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Speaker 3>claimed to have had friendships with</v>
<v Speaker 3>sasquatches like to move into the woods</v>

2085
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:14.440
<v Speaker 3>and they stayed there for months at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2086
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:15.701
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2087
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell people they had these stories</v>

2088
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:21.730
<v Speaker 3>and there's video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's audio recordings of what they</v>

2089
01:32:21.731 --> 01:32:24.250
<v Speaker 3>call Samurai talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to hear audio recordings that</v>

2090

<v Speaker 3>people think is a sasquatch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to laugh?</v>

2091
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to laugh hard.</v>

2092
01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do sasquatch.</v>

2093
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 3>She didn't say it was at a university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the natural history museum in</v>

2094
01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:34.744
<v Speaker 3>London.</v>

2095
01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.180
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

2096
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Kim Christ that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just make a noise.</v>

2097
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:50.320
<v Speaker 3>They have a us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the dumbest recording ever.</v>

2098
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Samurai chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this.</v>

2099
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Get ready for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gonna you gonna blow a gasket.</v>

2100
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 3>We had to analyze this on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how when I knew my show is</v>

2101
01:32:59.081 --> 01:32:59.914
<v Speaker 3>retarded,</v>

2102
01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:04.830
<v Speaker 10>Sierra's listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And he was there one time with a friend</v>

2103
01:33:04.831 --> 01:33:09.831
<v Speaker 10>and every evening they used to have some</v>
<v Speaker 10>absolutely bizarre noises and cool.</v>

2104
01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:11.970
<v Speaker 10>So they couldn't figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 10>hell it was.</v>

2105
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.940
<v Speaker 10>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so they took a tape recorder one time.</v>

2106
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.860
<v Speaker 10>And this is what they recorded.</v>

2107
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:23.210
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It is very bazaar.</v>

2108
01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:28.963
<v Speaker 11>Indeed.</v>

2109
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:52.230
<v Speaker 10>We decided to record the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm available to people.</v>

2110
01:33:52.630 --> 01:33:53.461
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what a good mood.</v>

2111
01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.500
<v Speaker 10>Do you believe these creatures are</v>
<v Speaker 10>trying to communicate with us?</v>

2112
01:33:55.501 --> 01:33:58.050
<v Speaker 10>So.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And we as we speak or having the</v>

2113
01:33:58.051 --> 01:34:02.910
<v Speaker 10>linguistics people look into it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they are very encouraged by what they're</v>

2114
01:34:02.911 --> 01:34:04.110
<v Speaker 10>saying so far.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is it human</v>

2115
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:06.160
<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>

2116
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 10>The range that supersedes what a human</v>
<v Speaker 10>can do.</v>

2117
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.640
<v Speaker 10>The range supersedes the human by a</v>
<v Speaker 10>previous study at the University of</v>

2118
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.640
<v Speaker 10>Wyoming to be spontaneous and no signs</v>
<v Speaker 10>of being rerecorded or prerecorded</v>

2119
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:23.070
<v Speaker 10>altered speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the idea of a hopes.</v>

2120
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.850
<v Speaker 10>It's very unprobable as far as</v>
<v Speaker 10>professionals are concerned at this</v>

2121
01:34:25.851 --> 01:34:26.520
<v Speaker 10>time.</v>

2122
01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Well you reduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made this video got uploaded,</v>

2123
01:34:30.871 --> 01:34:33.990
<v Speaker 3>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you that?</v>

2124
01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything look more like a man</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a monkey suit in that picture,</v>

2125
01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if they really did sound like</v>

2126
01:34:50.581 --> 01:34:51.720
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2127
01:34:51.721 --> 01:34:56.400
<v Speaker 3>what does chimps sound stupid to work if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you heard that,</v>

2128
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 3>but more complicated</v>

2129
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.560
<v Speaker 1>with an actual language like dolphin</v>
<v Speaker 1>noises,</v>

2130
01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:04.060
<v Speaker 1>sound stupid of dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make those noises and you heard</v>

2131
01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:04.933
<v Speaker 1>the dolphin noises.</v>

2132
01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.280
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a language.</v>

2133
01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird.</v>

2134
01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that Shit's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine there's like 20 of them.</v>

2135
01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll just live in deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

2136
01:35:19.751 --> 01:35:22.510
<v Speaker 1>deep in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more believable?</v>

2137
01:35:22.511 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot or Loch Ness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think loch ness is probably a really</v>

2138
01:35:27.131 --> 01:35:29.740
<v Speaker 1>big fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some kind of really big fish,</v>

2139
01:35:29.741 --> 01:35:34.741
<v Speaker 1>like a sturgeon or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something something really big that</v>

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Just that one of the craziest creations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature</v>

2173
01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.990
<v Speaker 1>or thor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he make sharks?</v>

2174
01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Was it Odin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who makes the sharks?</v>

2175
01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Who makes sure it was a god which God</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make sharks.</v>

2176
01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2177
01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking thing.</v>

2178
01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2179
01:37:31.841 --> 01:37:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had,</v>

2180
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:38.560
<v Speaker 1>if I had $100,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I built this fucking instead of an</v>

2181
01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:41.110
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this giant fucking ocean and</v>

2182
01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:44.950
<v Speaker 1>put great white and killer whale in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to fight killer whales when every</v>

2183
01:37:44.951 --> 01:37:46.480
<v Speaker 1>time you think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

2184
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great whites and not smart and they're</v>

2185
01:37:49.031 --> 01:37:51.400
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not smart.</v>

2186
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:52.610
<v Speaker 1>They just swim around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>

2187
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:54.300
<v Speaker 1>How did you dump them in the tank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

2188
01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>What would you never seen videos of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long would you think it would take</v>

2189
01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.470
<v Speaker 1>before the killer whale attack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great white.</v>

2190
01:38:00.471 --> 01:38:04.430
<v Speaker 1>You just don't big a quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you pay to watch sound?</v>

2191
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch on youtube and I'm like</v>

2192
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:08.071
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2193
01:38:08.071 --> 01:38:09.980
<v Speaker 1>but can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never any good video of it.</v>

2194
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I would never push no good video of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer whale jacket.</v>

2195
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like splash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>

2196
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>but you can never put a killer whale in</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

2197
01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I think putting a killer whale on tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just beyond 10 minutes.</v>

2198
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2199
01:38:22.161 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2200
01:38:23.290 --> 01:38:25.710
<v Speaker 1>You can't force it to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like forcing a person to</v>

2201
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:26.800
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like picking up the money.</v>

2202
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>He could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2203
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Were you going to go in a helicopter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up some guy from the middle of the</v>

2204
01:38:31.651 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking Bornean jungle and make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in a cage fight?</v>

2205
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:36.650
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you drop them in there with the</v>

2206
01:38:36.651 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 1>guy who's trying to kick his ass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dropped</v>

2207
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't.</v>

2208
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:44.010
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be that excited.</v>

2209
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the most exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible match.</v>

2210
01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is dolphins and</v>

2211
01:38:48.301 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 1>whales and killer whales are too smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up to do that to them.</v>

2212
01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2213
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:53.920
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

2214
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:55.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why I would never do it the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2215
01:38:55.081 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Would never have a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they get a fucking rabid one from</v>

2216
01:38:58.591 --> 01:39:01.350
<v Speaker 1>south that they got to find a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found that good.</v>

2217
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.210
<v Speaker 1>We found a Gamer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killer whales,</v>

2218
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they could definitely get the</v>

2219
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.760
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get a killer whale or a baby</v>

2220
01:39:08.761 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 1>killer whale and a fucking full grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferocious,</v>

2221
01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.373
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2222
01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Probably the great white would bite</v>
<v Speaker 1>right through it,</v>

2223
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was a baby.</v>

2224
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:21.900
<v Speaker 1>When they're grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fully grown adults.</v>

2225
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I think killer whales are bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were way smarter.</v>

2226
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 1>They're just wastes martyr and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right after the sharks.</v>

2227
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 1>They go after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided to fuck them up.</v>

2228
01:39:29.370 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2229
01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 1>the video is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they were watching a mother</v>

2230
01:39:33.271 --> 01:39:36.330
<v Speaker 1>and her daughter or son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother and her baby,</v>

2231
01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 1>and a killer whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The killer whale was swimming around</v>

2232
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 1>with this baby and the shark showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the killer whale was like,</v>

2233
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.390
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be right back.</v>

2234
01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that thing up.</v>

2235
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 1>They got that on video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:51.930
<v Speaker 1>They got an a video and then I think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer whale shark up,</v>

2237
01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:54.880
<v Speaker 1>didn't it bring the shark and display</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

2238
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to look it up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like at a recreated thing of it.</v>

2239
01:39:58.050 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it wasn't that.</v>

2240
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't get the camera down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how much bigger it is.</v>

2241
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:10.070
<v Speaker 1>See this is the dead shark at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the killer whale.</v>

2242
01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Biting the fucking shit out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shark.</v>

2243
01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.130
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have real good footage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how it went down.</v>

2244
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Was footage from some discovery channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they faced in probably,</v>

2245
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:21.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Gleiss.</v>

2246
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:25.560
<v Speaker 1>They do that now when I'm watching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking discovery channel.</v>

2247
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2248
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you got that shot.</v>

2249
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got that whole thing happening.</v>

2250
01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:31.950
<v Speaker 1>You see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>

2251
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:35.250
<v Speaker 1>It seems to make now it seems like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it now,</v>

2252
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but killer whales versus sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unless the shark is really big</v>

2253
01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 1>and the killer whales really young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then killer was just way too smart.</v>

2254
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.580
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a person almost just they don't</v>

2255
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 1>move like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't consider them like us,</v>

2256
01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but they have crazy language.</v>

2257
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>White versus dolphin to killed dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat them.</v>

2258
01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Great whites killed dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Itam.</v>

2259
01:40:57.850 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that shit.</v>

2260
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Like Jello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>

2261
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought they fuck sharks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

2262
01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.150
<v Speaker 1>They fucked off chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

2263
01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Let me make sure I'm correct about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating them.</v>

2264
01:41:08.891 --> 01:41:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I know they kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how could they catch a dolphin?</v>

2265
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that I don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill them,</v>

2266
01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling great whites killed off and</v>

2267
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they'd kill whales to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2268
01:41:18.241 --> 01:41:19.830
<v Speaker 1>not great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No orcas.</v>

2269
01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Did we say great wines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>St.</v>

2270
01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.373
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2271
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.430
<v Speaker 1>killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killer whales.</v>

2272
01:41:24.431 --> 01:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2273
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Great whites do to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can.</v>

2274
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:29.940
<v Speaker 1>If they keep talking about great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>

2275
01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said that's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said killer whales,</v>

2276
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:36.130
<v Speaker 1>but for sure a great white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't gonna kill my dolphin.</v>

2277
01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great white can.</v>

2278
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they bite him.</v>

2279
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get them if they fuck up if</v>

2280
01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 1>somebody fucks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the size difference</v>

2281
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 1>between killer whales and great whites</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just too big,</v>

2282
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very disappointed when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out the great whites are the killer</v>

2283
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:52.540
<v Speaker 1>whales rather not great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep,</v>

2284
01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying great wines that killer</v>
<v Speaker 1>whales are killing dolphins and they</v>

2285
01:41:56.081 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 1>kill other whales to like,</v>

2288
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:06.820
<v Speaker 1>these whales killer whales can't get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the ice,</v>

2289
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 1>they can hang on the ice because don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the dorsal fin or something and</v>

2290
01:42:09.071 --> 01:42:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they can swim through the ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that all ice is gone kilo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What about Operation Mockingbird?</v>

2400
01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was real.</v>

2401

<v Speaker 1>that was a real.</v>

2402
01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Which one was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CIA infiltrating a broadcasting and</v>

2403
01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>journalism and that they take for</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda purposes.</v>

2404
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:14.550
<v Speaker 1>This was a real operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2405
01:47:14.551 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>there's been some real operations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are undeniable that are pretty fucking</v>

2406
01:47:19.351 --> 01:47:22.390
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how crazy is it that a who,</v>

2407
01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

2408
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>that's this rumor that based on how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>present stuff like that,</v>

2409
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 1>based on how it's going down to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show and what they're pushing.</v>

2410
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And based on the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2411
01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:34.770
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2415
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN just like that.</v>

2416
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's easy to bleed in.</v>

2417
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 1>The Anderson Cooper was in the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He denied it for a long time.</v>

2418
01:47:48.121 --> 01:47:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Then he came out and said I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for a summer intern.</v>

2419
01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you said?</v>

2420
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>

2421
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first,</v>

2422
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and then his family comes from super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super wealthy background.</v>

2423
01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:07.620
<v Speaker 1>The vanderbilts and all that should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me.</v>

2424
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2425
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2426
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the other one that's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His operation midnight climax.</v>

2427
01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2428
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 1>The government ran brothels in San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco,</v>

2429
01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:23.700
<v Speaker 1>in New York and they got guys who came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to get laid and they dosed them with</v>

2430
01:48:23.701 --> 01:48:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Lsd so they could study them because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>

2431
01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:27.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2432
01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:29.940
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent real freedom of</v>

2433
01:48:29.941 --> 01:48:34.941
<v Speaker 1>information act operation midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climax how the CIA dose San Francisco</v>

2434
01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 1>citizens with Lsd and how crazy does</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sound?</v>

2435
01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.380
<v Speaker 1>How Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we said that happened today,</v>

2436
01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.510
<v Speaker 1>like what is going on today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

2437
01:48:42.511 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 1>You would be thought as a crazy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's happened before and unless</v>

2438
01:48:45.391 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2439
01:48:46.471 --> 01:48:47.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

2440
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Well then it happened before</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could read it.</v>

2441
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

2442
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 1>If you think through it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifts it up so you're considered nuts.</v>

2443
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 1>That's crazier than any conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory I believe,</v>

2444
01:48:58.891 --> 01:49:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's the craziest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to what it says.</v>

2445
01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It's been over 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Wayne,</v>

2446
01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Richie says he can still remember how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt to be dosed with acid.</v>

2447
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:09.630
<v Speaker 1>He was drinking Bourbon and soda with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other federal officers on a holiday</v>

2448
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:14.631
<v Speaker 1>party in 1957 at the US post office</v>
<v Speaker 1>building on seventh and mission streets.</v>

2449
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.280
<v Speaker 1>They were cracking jokes and swapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

2450
01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the room began to spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Red and green lights on the</v>

2451
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree in the corner spiraled</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildly.</v>

2452
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Richie's body temperature rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his gaze fixed on the dizzying colors</v>

2453
01:49:27.931 --> 01:49:28.870
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

2454
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It got jagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody dosed them,</v>

2455
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in this.</v>

2456
01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.580
<v Speaker 1>This guy is not the guy I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about being dosed at a</v>

2457
01:49:44.581 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not talking about operation</v>

2458
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>midnight climax</v>
<v Speaker 1>because midnight climax was about</v>

2459
01:49:50.171 --> 01:49:51.760
<v Speaker 1>brothels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they were calling it</v>

2460
01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:56.410
<v Speaker 1>operation midnight climax and they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy about getting feeling.</v>

2461
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely,</v>

2462
01:49:58.090 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 1>well he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see here,</v>

2463
01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:04.180
<v Speaker 1>say when he was high they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating against their will in</v>

2464
01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:05.920
<v Speaker 1>these studies is what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

2465
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:07.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go google into it,</v>

2466
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 1>look into it folks Google into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a real term,</v>

2467
01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's really interesting because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>had happened was they were doing these</v>

2468
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:16.090
<v Speaker 1>studies on soldiers and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get people to do it anymore.</v>

2469
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 1>People like get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't want to do it anymore.</v>

2470
01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So then they started to figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just try it on some other people.</v>

2471
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.600
<v Speaker 1>They figured if they did it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whorehouse,</v>

2472
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.310
<v Speaker 1>nobody would say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2473
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 1>guys don't want to admit they were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

2474
01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Just dose them up with an asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk out of there all crazy.</v>

2475
01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Stupid Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

2476
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of smart fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

2477
01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all setup so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliantly.</v>

2478
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fact everybody knows that the.</v>

2479
01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a corruption at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

2480
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 1>at the top levels and the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not on everybody,</v>

2481
01:50:49.091 --> 01:50:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that and it's okay.</v>

2482
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are really running shit</v>

2483
01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.860
<v Speaker 1>like the corporations and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international bankers like they blew the</v>

2484
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:04.861
<v Speaker 1>CIA is right there with nobody to a sue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one to throw in jail.</v>

2485
01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:07.850
<v Speaker 1>No one's accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just right there.</v>

2486
01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Just that they're involved in all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2487
01:51:09.551 --> 01:51:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Just like what you just posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're involved in.</v>

2488
01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's accountable.</v>

2489
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think is going to</v>

2490
01:51:13.561 --> 01:51:17.200
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think what I see as possible to</v>

2491
01:51:17.201 --> 01:51:19.650
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing that's happening with a</v>

2492
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.730
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was someone like Jeff Novitsky when</v>

2493
01:51:24.731 --> 01:51:26.980
<v Speaker 1>they have these Usada guys that are just</v>

2494
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.430
<v Speaker 6>showing up at your house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>4:00 in the morning,</v>

2495
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 6>take random tests.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have all these crazy things they</v>

2496
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 6>could test for that no one even knew</v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

2497
01:51:35.650 --> 01:51:38.740
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so slowly but surely,</v>

2498
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:42.730
<v Speaker 6>everybody's forced to be natural and</v>
<v Speaker 6>compete naturally and that's what we're</v>

2499
01:51:42.731 --> 01:51:44.120
<v Speaker 6>seeing right now in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just,</v>

2500
01:51:44.121 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just too,</v>

2501
01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:47.800
<v Speaker 6>it's too risky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are too good for too sophisticated.</v>

2502
01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:48.970
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So as far as we know,</v>

2503
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:52.180
<v Speaker 6>everybody's fighting natural,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we also know that they definitely</v>

2504
01:51:52.181 --> 01:51:54.280
<v Speaker 6>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They cheated like a motherfucker.</v>

2505
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 6>Everybody did in other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know that.</v>

2506
01:51:56.951 --> 01:51:59.520
<v Speaker 6>We know guys who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know guys that would just be juiced</v>

2507
01:51:59.521 --> 01:52:01.960
<v Speaker 6>out of their fucking mind and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 6>else was juiced out of their mind to.</v>

2508
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:05.530
<v Speaker 6>And that's how the game was being done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was competing on that level.</v>

2509
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:08.110
<v Speaker 6>So we know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in a lot of ways,</v>

2510
01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:12.610
<v Speaker 6>I think that's because of something</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2511
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:13.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2512
01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:17.670
<v Speaker 6>the new understanding of how to test</v>
<v Speaker 6>people and something like the UFC high</v>

2513
01:52:17.671 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 6>Reno Wicki to go after this.</v>

2514
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.590
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's data,</v>

2515
01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:21.610
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's information,</v>

2516
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:23.230
<v Speaker 6>all that information as it does come</v>
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

2517
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 6>they're forced to do it straight and</v>
<v Speaker 6>narrow.</v>

2518
01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.120
<v Speaker 6>I think that's going to be the case with</v>
<v Speaker 6>government at a certain point in time.</v>

2519
01:52:28.330 --> 01:52:30.860
<v Speaker 6>I think the people that are making a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck load of money and corporations,</v>

2520
01:52:30.861 --> 01:52:32.470
<v Speaker 6>they're going to make a fuck load of</v>
<v Speaker 6>money anyway,</v>

2521
01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:36.400
<v Speaker 6>but they're not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 6>manipulate environmental law the way</v>

2522
01:52:36.401 --> 01:52:39.040
<v Speaker 6>they're doing now and get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll be more transparent.</v>

2523
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:43.540
<v Speaker 6>They're not be able to influence</v>
<v Speaker 6>politicians to influence laws to make it</v>

2524
01:52:43.541 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 6>favor their business.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just won't able to do it so easily.</v>

2525
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 6>I think there's always going to be money</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be made.</v>

2526
01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:51.840
<v Speaker 6>There's always going to be people buying</v>
<v Speaker 6>cars and buildings and they're almost</v>

2527
01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 6>always going to be commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think there'll be less fuckery in</v>

2528
01:52:56.661 --> 01:52:57.494
<v Speaker 6>the future.</v>

2529
01:52:57.570 --> 01:53:00.530
<v Speaker 6>I think corporate fuckery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're still going.</v>

2530
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:03.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you can hide things</v>

2531
01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:08.081
<v Speaker 6>forever when it comes to like some of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the practices that some corporations</v>

2532
01:53:08.331 --> 01:53:11.240
<v Speaker 6>that are unscrupulous will engage in</v>
<v Speaker 6>that aren't necessarily ethical.</v>

2533
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.520
<v Speaker 6>Like how about the BP oil spill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2534
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.630
<v Speaker 6>Like how about how the other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2535
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.850
<v Speaker 6>the way they cleaned it up and the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they made people.</v>

2536
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:24.150
<v Speaker 6>There's people in that town that mean</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does,</v>

2537
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 6>how much of a loss was that to them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How could you possibly compensate them</v>

2538
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:29.810
<v Speaker 6>for?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know too much about the BP oil</v>

2539
01:53:29.811 --> 01:53:32.600
<v Speaker 6>spill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>BP oil spill is pretty fucking crazy.</v>

2540
01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:35.300
<v Speaker 6>I know it killed the Gulf and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know the details.</v>

2541
01:53:35.301 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was some kind of,</v>

2542
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the report.</v>

2543
01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.000
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anything about having</v>
<v Speaker 6>looked into it.</v>

2544
01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 6>It was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2545
01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.220
<v Speaker 6>things that they pull the oil out of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ground,</v>

2546
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 6>those bloated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She had a lot of animals and it's just a</v>

2547
01:53:47.871 --> 01:53:52.871
<v Speaker 6>lot of industry and oil into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2548
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:58.730
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing how many gallons were being</v>

2549
01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 6>pumped into the ocean and even more</v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing how the ocean just sort of</v>

2550
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:03.740
<v Speaker 6>absorbs it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think a trump.</v>

2551
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 6>That's a long question.</v>

2552
01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:10.120
<v Speaker 6>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2553
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a strange time.</v>

2554
01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:15.500
<v Speaker 6>It's strange to see a president that is</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2555
01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you like him or don't like him?</v>

2556
01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.970
<v Speaker 6>Whether you support his beliefs or you</v>
<v Speaker 6>think he's the worst thing ever?</v>

2557
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:27.050
<v Speaker 6>I'm just looking at it as objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like as a performance piece.</v>

2558
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:33.040
<v Speaker 6>There's never been a guy that</v>
<v Speaker 6>understands how to manipulate the media</v>

2559
01:54:34.551 --> 01:54:35.720
<v Speaker 6>the way he does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>

2560
01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.120
<v Speaker 6>No one even close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He made everything he does is a big</v>

2561
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 6>story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He says outrageous things and because he</v>

2562
01:54:41.121 --> 01:54:43.520
<v Speaker 6>says outrageous things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tune in to make sure he says more</v>

2563
01:54:43.521 --> 01:54:46.100
<v Speaker 6>outrageous things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The more outrageous things he says,</v>

2564
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:48.620
<v Speaker 6>the more people go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's saying outrageous things.</v>

2565
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:51.140
<v Speaker 6>Let's tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the biggest show in town,</v>

2566
01:54:51.650 --> 01:54:54.170
<v Speaker 6>like it's not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm in close.</v>

2567
01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.200
<v Speaker 6>Who generates more attention?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's got people more riled up about it?</v>

2568
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:01.700
<v Speaker 6>People are bored as fuck.</v>

2569
01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 6>They're bored,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're bored.</v>

2570
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:06.770
<v Speaker 6>They hired Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they thought everything was gonna change</v>

2571
01:55:06.970 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess did a little on some fronts and</v>

2572
01:55:10.011 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 6>it was good socially and the world's</v>
<v Speaker 6>evolving in that way,</v>

2573
01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:14.840
<v Speaker 6>in that direction anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's all good.</v>

2574
01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:20.270
<v Speaker 6>But Guantanamo Bay still open.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are still in Afghanistan.</v>

2575
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:21.470
<v Speaker 6>Seems like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2576
01:55:21.490 --> 01:55:23.690
<v Speaker 6>it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still chaos everywhere.</v>

2577
01:55:23.691 --> 01:55:25.160
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if anybody could have ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>fixed it,</v>

2578
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.910
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

2579
01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:29.000
<v Speaker 6>we're just bored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're bored.</v>

2580
01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.800
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are we doing?</v>

2581
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:32.660
<v Speaker 6>What is this world?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why are we in the Middle East?</v>

2582
01:55:32.661 --> 01:55:33.450
<v Speaker 6>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

2583
01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:35.180
<v Speaker 6>I'd have to worry about war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why don't have to worry about gas?</v>

2584
01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:36.530
<v Speaker 6>Why don't have to worry about global</v>
<v Speaker 6>warming?</v>

2585
01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:37.640
<v Speaker 6>What's going to happen with the polar</v>
<v Speaker 6>bears?</v>

2586
01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 6>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then all of a sudden this guy comes</v>

2587
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:41.600
<v Speaker 6>along and telling you how big his dick</v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

2588
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to build up a fucking</v>

2589
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:48.040
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million miles high Mexicans out joey</v>

2590
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:51.930
<v Speaker 1>the first of all they built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't finish already put up a</v>

2591
01:55:51.931 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2592
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And everybody cheers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2593
01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And the Mexican president calls me up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

2594
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.150
<v Speaker 1>who's going to pay for that wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pay for that wall.</v>

2595
01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And the wall just got 10 feet higher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hangs up the phone and everybody's</v>

2596
01:56:04.111 --> 01:56:07.110
<v Speaker 1>cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulls his dick just off.</v>

2597
01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:08.983
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 1>He told the guy the wall just got 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet higher.</v>

2599
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what I told him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Wall just got 10 feet higher.</v>

2600
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.160
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2601
01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see that cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you find that class?</v>

2602
01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie from the eighties.</v>

2603
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And yesterday the top person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Mexico said,</v>

2604
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:31.460
<v Speaker 1>we will never ever pay for that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the press called me up and they</v>

2605
01:56:32.521 --> 01:56:33.930
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call her on the head,</v>

2606
01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top person.</v>

2607
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:38.010
<v Speaker 1>He said he won't pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't pay for it.</v>

2608
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said the wall just got 10 feet higher.</v>

2609
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:45.023
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>

2610
01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 6>He fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I keep saying it's true.</v>

2611
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:50.400
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

2612
01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:56.390
<v Speaker 6>He's so strange is it's just so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I feel like almost like I'm</v>

2613
01:56:57.421 --> 01:57:01.230
<v Speaker 6>watching like one of them late night</v>
<v Speaker 6>televangelists shows somebody wants,</v>

2614
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.240
<v Speaker 6>wants your money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can have my money.</v>

2615
01:57:03.241 --> 01:57:04.980
<v Speaker 6>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do already have money.</v>

2616
01:57:04.981 --> 01:57:05.814
<v Speaker 6>You can't get money.</v>

2617
01:57:10.190 --> 01:57:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It's feels like</v>

2618
01:57:11.410 --> 01:57:14.600
<v Speaker 6>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like this is the final piece of</v>

2619
01:57:14.601 --> 01:57:16.550
<v Speaker 6>the simulation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2620
01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.780
<v Speaker 6>The final piece of the show where it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to reveal that this has all been a</v>

2621
01:57:20.781 --> 01:57:23.600
<v Speaker 6>comedy all along.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been a strange comedy.</v>

2622
01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you think?</v>

2623
01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.940
<v Speaker 6>He's really a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's better than the other ones except</v>

2624
01:57:28.941 --> 01:57:32.090
<v Speaker 6>for Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's better than all the other people on</v>

2625
01:57:32.091 --> 01:57:33.740
<v Speaker 6>the Republican side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2626
01:57:33.741 --> 01:57:36.820
<v Speaker 6>Marco Rubio seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

2627
01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.530
<v Speaker 6>a reasonable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of ways the way talks.</v>

2628
01:57:39.590 --> 01:57:42.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't know exactly what he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his beliefs are,</v>

2629
01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:44.990
<v Speaker 6>but him and trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get into these insult competitions</v>

2630
01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:48.300
<v Speaker 6>and it looked so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like just because trump does it,</v>

2631
01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.010
<v Speaker 6>just don't do it better than him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't do it better than him.</v>

2632
01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:56.730
<v Speaker 6>Talk about how ridiculous it is and</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't allow that guy to like you.</v>

2633
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:59.900
<v Speaker 6>They're talking about a big as hands are</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're going back and forth with</v>

2634
01:57:59.901 --> 01:58:04.190
<v Speaker 6>each other and insulting his hair and</v>
<v Speaker 6>insulting a spray tan I like.</v>

2635
01:58:04.190 --> 01:58:06.470
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like the roasting against each</v>

2636
01:58:06.471 --> 01:58:08.120
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is not presidential.</v>

2637
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:11.460
<v Speaker 6>I understand you guys have a limited</v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of time and this with</v>

2638
01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:17.000
<v Speaker 6>the fake Tan and trump was bagging on</v>
<v Speaker 6>rubio wearing makeup.</v>

2639
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:20.570
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is a terrible way to have</v>

2640
01:58:20.571 --> 01:58:23.870
<v Speaker 6>these people together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like to have these people all competing.</v>

2641
01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:28.370
<v Speaker 6>Then what you're going to get is who's</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best at giving you a sound byte</v>

2642
01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:30.830
<v Speaker 6>under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not going to get who's the best</v>

2643
01:58:30.831 --> 01:58:34.040
<v Speaker 6>leader you're going to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's the best at doing that debate</v>

2644
01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:36.770
<v Speaker 6>thing that's you're going to get because</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a weird thing.</v>

2645
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:40.070
<v Speaker 6>You're standing up there on a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're right next to a guy was talking</v>

2646
01:58:40.071 --> 01:58:42.730
<v Speaker 6>shit about you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What he's saying is not even true and</v>

2647
01:58:42.731 --> 01:58:43.840
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can even respond.</v>

2648
01:58:43.841 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 6>You've gotta wait like fuck you man.</v>

2649
01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 6>It's a stupid way to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the fact that they time them,</v>

2650
01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 6>they give them like ready,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

2651
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what you do.</v>

2652
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 6>You let them talk for long period of</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2653
01:58:53.381 --> 01:58:56.890
<v Speaker 6>If they're long winded and boring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people don't like them anymore.</v>

2654
01:58:57.010 --> 01:58:59.650
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You put them in a long form,</v>

2655
01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 6>have them talk for hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let him talk on a podcast.</v>

2656
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 6>Every fucking presidential candidate</v>
<v Speaker 6>should have a long form podcasts that</v>

2657
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:11.450
<v Speaker 6>they have to do every day and we see</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not people want to listen to</v>

2658
01:59:11.451 --> 01:59:13.330
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not like have someone barking at you on</v>

2659
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:15.940
<v Speaker 6>the left and bar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tell me what the fuck you can do and</v>

2660
01:59:15.941 --> 01:59:19.710
<v Speaker 6>then have someone talk to them that</v>
<v Speaker 6>understands what can and can't be done.</v>

2661
01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:24.100
<v Speaker 6>Have someone who's a real political</v>
<v Speaker 6>expert sitting down and asking them some</v>

2662
01:59:24.101 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 6>hard questions and do it all the time</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that end based on that and their</v>

2663
01:59:28.751 --> 01:59:32.350
<v Speaker 6>qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but based on like back and forth,</v>

2664
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:33.100
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

2665
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.570
<v Speaker 6>Bickering with each other and insulting</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other on our spray tans and your.</v>

<v Speaker 6>army the world has ever known and you're</v>

2668

<v Speaker 6>acting like assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is so stupid.</v>

2669
01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:47.050
<v Speaker 6>Like this isn't just like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2671
01:59:48.101 --> 01:59:50.000

2672
01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:52.570
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you run the world,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you're insulting each other on makeup</v>

2674
01:59:55.181 --> 01:59:56.860
<v Speaker 6>and Tan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should be saying,</v>

<v Speaker 6>do you know how fucking stupid it is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're talking about?</v>

2676
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.790
<v Speaker 6>We have a five minute time period that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get to talk in or whatever the fuck</v>

<v Speaker 6>assaulting each other on hand size.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you guys are babies.</v>

2681
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.820
<v Speaker 6>there's no way you could be the best.</v>

2682
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:17.080
<v Speaker 6>So like he ends involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Ted Cruz is like super religious,</v>

2683
02:00:17.081 --> 02:00:18.160
<v Speaker 6>which always makes me go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2684
02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ben Carson is super reasonable,</v>

2685
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 6>but super religious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

2689
02:00:32.261 --> 02:00:33.770
<v Speaker 6>agree with?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2691
02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:39.010
<v Speaker 6>I honestly have been so blown away by</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bad things that he said that I</v>

2692
02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 6>barely paid attention to the good</v>
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

2693
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.130
<v Speaker 6>but the shit that he said about Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like someone's doing all the raping,</v>

2694
02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:47.830
<v Speaker 6>like bringing over a murderers and</v>
<v Speaker 6>rapists.</v>

2695
02:00:47.831 --> 02:00:49.090
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

2696
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:51.010
<v Speaker 6>like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a whole country.</v>

2697
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about,</v>

2698
02:00:53.441 --> 02:00:55.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like most someone's doing the raping.</v>

2699
02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:58.570
<v Speaker 6>He says some crazy shit and it works</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2700
02:00:58.570 --> 02:01:01.030
<v Speaker 6>It works as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's all a pr campaign.</v>

2701
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:03.220
<v Speaker 6>And he just gets in there and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2702
02:01:03.221 --> 02:01:04.270
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said what I said,</v>

2703
02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:07.840
<v Speaker 6>and I did what I did to prove a point</v>
<v Speaker 6>that our media system is corrupt.</v>

2704
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:11.020
<v Speaker 6>This whole system is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It needs to be fixed.</v>

2705
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a bad computer.</v>

2706
02:01:13.391 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 6>It needs to be rebuilt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not good.</v>

2707
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:18.310
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't have a guy just juke the</v>
<v Speaker 6>system like I just did.</v>

2708
02:01:18.710 --> 02:01:21.460
<v Speaker 6>That's what would be the most amazing</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing if he gets into office and said</v>

2709
02:01:21.461 --> 02:01:23.740
<v Speaker 6>this is a very important position,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so no more insults,</v>

2710
02:01:23.741 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 6>no more bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and now that I'm here,</v>

2711
02:01:25.541 --> 02:01:27.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just hire the best people and we try to</v>

2712
02:01:27.071 --> 02:01:28.540
<v Speaker 6>figure out what the fuck's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 6>this country.</v>

2713
02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:30.040
<v Speaker 6>How amazing would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

2714
02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:30.851
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had an insult,</v>

2715
02:01:30.851 --> 02:01:34.060
<v Speaker 6>these dummies in order to get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't let Hillary Talk Shit.</v>

2716
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:38.290
<v Speaker 6>I had to go in there guns blazing and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to take out Ben Sanders and fucking</v>

2717
02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 6>Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now that all that's done,</v>

2718
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:42.500
<v Speaker 6>we can all work together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think,</v>

2719
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:44.450
<v Speaker 6>Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is your.</v>

2720
02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:49.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how you can be entrenched</v>

2721
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:55.030
<v Speaker 6>in the system for as long as she's been</v>
<v Speaker 6>entrenched in the system and not be not</v>

2722
02:01:57.501 --> 02:01:59.030
<v Speaker 6>be the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the past.</v>

2723
02:01:59.270 --> 02:02:00.530
<v Speaker 6>That's the system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2724
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.560
<v Speaker 6>The system is these special interest</v>
<v Speaker 6>groups and lobbyists and making deals</v>

2725
02:02:07.671 --> 02:02:08.660
<v Speaker 6>and having,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2726
02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:10.750
<v Speaker 6>sitting down with all these people at</v>
<v Speaker 6>these tables.</v>

2727
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:13.910
<v Speaker 6>In one hand she knows more about</v>
<v Speaker 6>government than any of them.</v>

2728
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:19.040
<v Speaker 6>She knows more about government than for</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure trump,</v>

2729
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:21.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he knows about influence.</v>

2730
02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:24.590
<v Speaker 6>He knows how to influence politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He donates money to politicians,</v>

2731
02:02:24.591 --> 02:02:28.240
<v Speaker 6>he understands all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as far as like being in the board</v>

2732
02:02:28.241 --> 02:02:29.900
<v Speaker 6>rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the shit goes down,</v>

2733
02:02:29.901 --> 02:02:32.390
<v Speaker 6>Hillary's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's been like right in there.</v>

2734
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:37.430
<v Speaker 6>So as far as like qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one's got more qualifications for</v>

2735
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:41.900
<v Speaker 6>president than Hillary does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is do you.</v>

2736
02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 6>Here's here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all agree.</v>

2737
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:46.610
<v Speaker 6>I think we all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is not a knock against Hillary.</v>

2738
02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:48.950
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all agree that this system is fucked.</v>

2739
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:50.690
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Representative government,</v>

2740
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:54.290
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you can have a bunch of</v>

2741
02:02:54.291 --> 02:02:56.050
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They vote and they vote for one person.</v>

2742
02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 6>That person represents that state and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then the state,</v>

2743
02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.340
<v Speaker 6>they'll get the gun and they try to pick</v>
<v Speaker 6>the president of the electoral college</v>

2744
02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 6>and all of its wackiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all agree that that's kind of crazy,</v>

2745
02:03:03.741 --> 02:03:05.900
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all agree it doesn't make much sense.</v>

2746
02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.700
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of things we don't get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>vote on.</v>

2747
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:10.310
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The country goes one way or another way</v>

2748
02:03:10.311 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 6>that we were really unhappy with and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>would be nice if we had like a giant</v>

2749
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:14.510
<v Speaker 6>public debate.</v>

2750
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.290
<v Speaker 6>So the only person that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>change that,</v>

2751
02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.040
<v Speaker 6>the only person who's going to knock</v>
<v Speaker 6>that off its ass is trump because he's</v>

2752
02:03:22.041 --> 02:03:25.160
<v Speaker 6>the only guy who's got his own money</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that from the Republican side.</v>

2753
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 6>He's the only guy in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the in the democratic side.</v>

2754
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 6>Hillary's got a shitload of money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she's kind of a part of the system.</v>

2755
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.410
<v Speaker 6>And Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2756
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:36.860
<v Speaker 6>he's got some good ideas socially wants</v>
<v Speaker 6>to make marijuana legal,</v>

2757
02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:38.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he wants to,</v>

2758
02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 6>wants to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to,</v>

2759
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:45.290
<v Speaker 6>wants to unite us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to pay for student education,</v>

2760
02:03:45.291 --> 02:03:48.890
<v Speaker 6>which I think is a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wants to raise up the minimum wage.</v>

2761
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a great idea to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even though I don't know shit about</v>

2762
02:03:51.561 --> 02:03:55.250
<v Speaker 6>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's like there's not a lot of great</v>

2763
02:03:55.251 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 6>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>

2764
02:03:56.601 --> 02:03:58.940
<v Speaker 6>Like Hillary would be the best choice on</v>
<v Speaker 6>paper.</v>

2765
02:03:59.210 --> 02:04:03.890
<v Speaker 6>She's been there right on paper or</v>
<v Speaker 6>paper.</v>

2766
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:06.110
<v Speaker 6>She's a crook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think she's a crook.</v>

2767
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:09.590
<v Speaker 6>Do you know where on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when I was that bad?</v>

2768
02:04:09.710 --> 02:04:12.130

<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

2809
02:05:48.241 --> 02:05:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

2814
02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:03.520

<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2815
02:06:03.630 --> 02:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>That's where it all.</v>

<v Speaker 2>all connected with the same families.</v>

2820

<v Speaker 2>The same secret society that goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2821
02:06:15.641 --> 02:06:20.130
<v Speaker 2>it's most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it started with John d</v>

2822
02:06:20.130 --> 02:06:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Rockefeller and standard oil.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the craziest thing about the whole thing</v>

2825
02:06:27.451 --> 02:06:31.290
<v Speaker 2>is he was so into monopolizing oil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2826
02:06:31.291 --> 02:06:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Once it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just oil banking.</v>

2827
02:06:33.301 --> 02:06:36.240
<v Speaker 2>He got into everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big farm and he had controlled</v>

2828
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:39.720
<v Speaker 2>everything he was showed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Rockefeller was so dominant,</v>

2829
02:06:39.721 --> 02:06:41.160
<v Speaker 2>he was playing with the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire.</v>

2830
02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>He was ruling the world man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2831
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 2>the one thing is that all hemp or</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana conspiracy theories,</v>

2832
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>they all are aware of the reefer madness</v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2836
02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>and then finally they worked after 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of all this,</v>

2837
02:07:00.970 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda that made we'd look like a</v>

02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 2>We all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were trying to shut down the</v>

2842
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:14.850
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're blaming it on this Mexican</v>

2843
02:07:14.851 --> 02:07:16.920
<v Speaker 2>smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we all know that as we'd</v>

2844

2846
02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:25.260
<v Speaker 2>because of John Rockefeller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2847
02:07:25.410 --> 02:07:30.410
<v Speaker 2>he supported anti alcohol groups and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew them up and donated millions to</v>

2848
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>blow them up to get to outlaw alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he thought this is a threat to</v>

2849
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

2850
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 2>And this is not a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol prohibition was all backed by a</v>

2851
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:46.240
<v Speaker 2>John d Dot Rockefeller who was a threat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gasoline.</v>

2852
02:07:46.241 --> 02:07:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol,</v>

2853
02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.090
<v Speaker 2>because they thought people are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>make like ethanol.</v>

2854
02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:49.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2855
02:07:49.781 --> 02:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2856
02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 2>he just wanted a band at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want her to crush the ethanol</v>

2857
02:07:53.861 --> 02:07:54.510
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2858
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2859
02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:59.130
<v Speaker 2>but the way he did it is to create this</v>
<v Speaker 2>hysteria with drink.</v>

2860
02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:00.450
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a drinking problem and</v>

2861
02:08:00.690 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>killing each other.</v>

2862
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So he did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did both of them.</v>

2863
02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You're going to find out about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a conspiracy theory.</v>

2864
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they made a,</v>

2865
02:08:10.930 --> 02:08:13.170
<v Speaker 2>they wore their worship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2866
02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Quickly how big oil conquered the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2867
02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he funded a,</v>

2868
02:08:19.410 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 2>the Anti Saloon League.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was run by one of his good friends</v>

2869
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 2>and that was took and you know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up happening,</v>

2870
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:28.210
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They outlawed alcohol,</v>

2871
02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you can drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said what about the alcohol for</v>

2872
02:08:30.611 --> 02:08:33.640
<v Speaker 2>cars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they wrote in the law that you could</v>

2873
02:08:33.641 --> 02:08:37.630
<v Speaker 2>still make alcohol for cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to put petroleum in it so</v>

2874
02:08:37.631 --> 02:08:41.470
<v Speaker 2>that people don't drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it made it killed the business.</v>

2875
02:08:41.471 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So now they got to put oil in it if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to sell it and then it killed it</v>

2876
02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:46.990
<v Speaker 2>killed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He do.</v>

2877
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:49.750
<v Speaker 2>He killed everything and he got busted</v>
<v Speaker 2>for everything.</v>

2878
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:51.880
<v Speaker 2>John D Dot Rockefeller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Dad was named,</v>

2879
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:54.070
<v Speaker 2>they called them devil bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Dad,</v>

2880
02:08:54.071 --> 02:08:56.980
<v Speaker 2>they know all about is that this is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy theory or their family.</v>

2881
02:08:56.981 --> 02:08:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Historians will tell you about his</v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

2882
02:08:58.451 --> 02:09:03.070
<v Speaker 2>He created him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a rapist snake oil salesman</v>

2883
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:07.990
<v Speaker 2>running from the law changed his name</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Devil Bill.</v>

2884
02:09:07.991 --> 02:09:10.330
<v Speaker 2>That was his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had a bunch of sons and John d</v>

2885
02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Rockefeller was one and he was known he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to.</v>

2886
02:09:12.850 --> 02:09:15.820
<v Speaker 2>He was quoted as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cheap my sons every day.</v>

2887
02:09:15.821 --> 02:09:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I want them to see a sharp as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just beat the living fuck,</v>

2888
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:22.810
<v Speaker 2>trust out of them and just drowned all</v>
<v Speaker 2>their trust.</v>

2889
02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John D Rockefeller,</v>

2890
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:26.700
<v Speaker 2>grew up not trusting anybody will do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2891
02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Rockefeller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ford and the secret history of alcohol.</v>

2892
02:09:30.590 --> 02:09:32.930
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The secret history regarding alcohol</v>

2893
02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:36.140
<v Speaker 6>that you won't hear on the 6:00 news</v>
<v Speaker 6>cars and everything else running on</v>

2894
02:09:36.141 --> 02:09:41.141
<v Speaker 6>internal combustion engines can run on</v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol at least as well as they can run</v>

2895
02:09:41.151 --> 02:09:42.380
<v Speaker 6>on gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Indeed,</v>

2896
02:09:42.381 --> 02:09:46.520
<v Speaker 6>engines were built back in 1870.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That could run using alcohol or</v>

2897
02:09:46.521 --> 02:09:48.890
<v Speaker 6>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A New York Times article from 19.</v>

2898
02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:52.100
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eight enthusiastically states auto is</v>

2899
02:09:52.101 --> 02:09:56.090
<v Speaker 6>discussed alcohol as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Great future ahead for use in commercial</v>

2900
02:09:56.091 --> 02:09:58.340
<v Speaker 6>wagons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has Professor Lock,</v>

2901
02:09:58.380 --> 02:09:59.400
<v Speaker 6>lock,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lock.</v>

2902
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.100
<v Speaker 6>What does it say that look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2903
02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:07.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm tests with motor truck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Er Hewitt</v>

2904
02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.810
<v Speaker 6>tells engineers of his results with</v>
<v Speaker 6>gasoline and alcohol and the same</v>

2905
02:10:11.811 --> 02:10:13.670
<v Speaker 6>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Henry Ford said that alcohol was a</v>

2906
02:10:13.671 --> 02:10:14.421
<v Speaker 6>cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nicer,</v>

2907
02:10:14.421 --> 02:10:16.730
<v Speaker 6>better fuel for automobiles than</v>
<v Speaker 6>gasoline.</v>

2908
02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.110
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2909
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:20.180
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is nuts,</v>

2910
02:10:20.181 --> 02:10:20.790
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2911
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

2912
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.080
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking banana propaganda.</v>

2913
02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol propaganda.</v>

2914
02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:31.060
<v Speaker 6>That is so crazy because you can make</v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol without fossil fuels.</v>

2915
02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 6>So if you made alcohol today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could fuel</v>

2916
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can make alcohol,</v>

2917
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:39.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People make apple apparently anything,</v>

2918
02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:42.410
<v Speaker 1>any vegetable that ferments you can use</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fuel.</v>

2919
02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.030
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

2920
02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Neil Young has that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2921
02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.340
<v Speaker 1>he has diesel though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't make alcohol fueled,</v>

2922
02:10:48.341 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 1>but he makes diesel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes.</v>

2923
02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Biodiesel is a giant ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's northern California at the</v>

2924
02:10:53.091 --> 02:10:54.560
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it ferments,</v>

2925
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:58.760
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe you call it diesel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fermented vegetable matter.</v>

2926
02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

2927
02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what Henry Ford said.</v>

2928
02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford said anything that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferment apples,</v>

2929
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could turn it into biofuel.</v>

2930
02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.350
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John D Dot Rockefeller.</v>

2931
02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the richest man in the world,</v>

2932
02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>was raised by a psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did.</v>

2933
02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:18.590
<v Speaker 1>He got busted for monopolizing or are</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finally indicted him?</v>

2934
02:11:18.591 --> 02:11:21.170
<v Speaker 1>He had a break out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a break apart standard oil,</v>

2935
02:11:21.171 --> 02:11:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and it made him a billionaire.</v>

2936
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:24.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what made him rich is when he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted.</v>

2937
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 1>When he got to sell everything off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just.</v>

2938
02:11:26.590 --> 02:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>He took over education do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you learn how to a documentary,</v>

2939
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:34.880
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big oil conquer the world on</v>

2940
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

2941
02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Scared you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2942
02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:40.790
<v Speaker 1>You actually learn what it all comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a hundred percent,</v>

2943
02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2944
02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:44.600
<v Speaker 1>It's psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:11:44.690 --> 02:11:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One dude with his sons,</v>

2946
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:49.130
<v Speaker 1>his sons and his grandson and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense,</v>

2947
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:49.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2948
02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:54.320
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the really super ambitious people</v>

2949
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 1>in business are a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most cutthroat than most.</v>

2950
02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You mean how competitive you got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like a William Randolph hearst or</v>

2951
02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:03.960
<v Speaker 1>one of these motherfuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2953
02:12:07.641 --> 02:12:09.680
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't just trying to sell gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to take over the world.</v>

2954
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Our education system is all based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockefeller Foundation.</v>

2955
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like key strategically wanted to make</v>

2956
02:12:17.901 --> 02:12:20.990
<v Speaker 1>school so that we got people just smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just this conspiracy to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just smart enough to work.</v>

2958
02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:28.370
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want anybody to smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the school system is designed</v>

2959
02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 1>to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's watched the documentary and then</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is how we did it.</v>

2962
02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:38.750
<v Speaker 1>This is how he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just donate.</v>

2963
02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:41.900
<v Speaker 1>He said he'd go to a university like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago and just how I'm</v>

2964
02:12:41.901 --> 02:12:43.760
<v Speaker 1>going to give you millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>John d Dot Rockefeller got 2020</v>
