00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience when I was,</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about,</v>

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>to change the subject a little bit when you were talking about being honest and</v>

5
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

6
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a great acting teacher,</v>

7
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I think I can say his name because he actually talks about it and he's a really</v>

8
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.561
<v Speaker 1>good teacher.</v>

9
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>He was a medic in Vietnam for two tours.</v>

10
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.111
<v Speaker 1>He's seen everything,</v>

11
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>and he was like one of the first people that somebody said to him in class,</v>

13
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:20.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>he's take class from seven to 12.</v>

15
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.471
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it,</v>

16
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:22.981
<v Speaker 1>cause I love him.</v>

17
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>His name is Richard Lawson is a really special guy and he's got to Kuwait acting</v>

18
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.701
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

19
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

20
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.021
<v Speaker 1>somebody said,</v>

22
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I never seen you yawn.</v>

23
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.821
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

24
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>because I don't put my attention on myself.</v>

26
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I put my attention out there.</v>

27
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about being tired.</v>

28
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't focus on the fatigue.</v>

29
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.081
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

30
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.381
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

31
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

32
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I learned in Vietnam watching when a Viet Cong,</v>

33
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>when an American would get shot,</v>

34
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they'd go into shock.</v>

35
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>When you get shot you go,</v>

36
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.021
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

37
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:46.501
<v Speaker 1>I get shot.</v>

38
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the time what goes,</v>

39
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>what causes you to go into shock is also a notion that you get shot in your</v>

40
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>heart starts beating really fast cause you're terrified because you might die.</v>

41
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:54.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

42
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you go into that notion,</v>

43
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the Vietcong,</v>

44
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>they get shot in these horrific injuries and you could still interrogate them</v>

45
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>cause they'd be putting their attention out there.</v>

46
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>They would immediately start focusing and their whole way of thinking anyway was</v>

47
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>they were a leaf on a tree.</v>

48
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:08.664
<v Speaker 1>They weren't the tree.</v>

49
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>So for whatever reason they wouldn't go into shock as quickly.</v>

50
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>They would immediately put their attention on,</v>

51
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>something in front of them.</v>

53
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't focusing on the wound.</v>

54
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And he said he used to see that when he was a medic taking care of people.</v>

55
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And he saw such a fundamental striking difference in the mindset between the</v>

56
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Vietcong and an American Gi.</v>

57
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And he was so impressed with their ability to focus on anything but themselves.</v>

58
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>They were not part of this equation.</v>

59
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>They were a very small part of the equation that he used it in his own life.</v>

60
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:37.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:37.871
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

62
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>he would use this idea of he was tired or you know,</v>

63
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>feeling sick that he would just literally put his mind over there off himself,</v>

64
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>take himself out of the and actually watch himself move through what he had to</v>

65
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>get done.</v>

66
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I bet you probably get a lot more energy out of just doing that then opposed to</v>

67
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>like festering on the idea that you're tired of the course,</v>

68
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

69
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I always found that the things that I'd just test the most and other people are</v>

70
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the things I'm terrified of seeing in myself and the person who doesn't know how</v>

71
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>to like push through shit and get things done and just come on,</v>

72
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

73
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>

74
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

75
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.281
<v Speaker 1>Get the done,</v>

76
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>get it done,</v>

77
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.061
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

78
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not terrified of being that guy.</v>

79
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified and not getting shit done and you know,</v>

80
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>and it forces me to find it to be gross and other people,</v>

81
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

82
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

83
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the things that scares me about them taking wrestling out of</v>

84
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:23.094
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics.</v>

85
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

86
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst.</v>

87
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.841
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

88
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>All the sport in the Olympics,</v>

89
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's and the fact that it's not even in every high school.</v>

90
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some real lessons to be learned that a lot of people are never</v>

91
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>going to learn and those lessons are how to get through difficult shit,</v>

92
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>how to get through the physical difficult chicken and doing things physical,</v>

93
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people were avoiding.</v>

94
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>You get a more balanced mastery of your own mind and that's a fucking important</v>

95
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>aspect of being the human being and a lot of people are skipping that step.</v>

96
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are skipping that stuff.</v>

97
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

98
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It can.</v>

99
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It can fuck you in the long run,</v>

100
00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:58.681
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

101
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>It can give you the extra push toward saying something stupid.</v>

102
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>It can give you the extra bad energy to take a left turn and I'll look to get</v>

103
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>good at anything.</v>

104
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

105
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's take wrestling or Jujitsu as an example.</v>

106
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>If you're you,</v>

107
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get good,</v>

108
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you better work at what you're bad at.</v>

109
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>You better work at the things,</v>

110
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:15.481
<v Speaker 1>you're bad at it.</v>

111
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't go in there and tap people out with the stuff that you constantly know</v>

112
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>cause the guys that are working on the stuff they're not good at are going to</v>

113
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>surpass you.</v>

114
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you just learned that the hard way.</v>

115
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:23.780
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

116
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're not careful and I think everything is that way,</v>

117
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.801
<v Speaker 1>you know you better,</v>

118
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you better work at what you are the and you gain a lot of it.</v>

119
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that times I'll tell you,</v>

120
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>hey you better music better than musical instrument.</v>

122
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to do something.</v>

123
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>What I like about doing,</v>

124
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.813
<v Speaker 1>playing the drums,</v>

125
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to learn how to do four different things with which each limb it's really</v>

126
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do.</v>

127
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I gain a lot from just the practice and the stretch of trying to learn how to be</v>

128
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.850
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

129
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>have all four limbs doing something independent.</v>

130
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

131
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting to me.</v>

132
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It actually changes my whole mindset.</v>

133
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I actually approach things very differently for the rest of my day.</v>

134
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:56.831
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

135
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain how or define how,</v>

136
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>but it does make a difference.</v>

137
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I think when you take on new activities,</v>

138
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.741
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

139
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>when it starts concentrating on some new thing,</v>

140
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>whether it's playing the drums or a new game you're trying to master whatever</v>

141
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:09.694
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it is.</v>

142
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>When your mind gets really enthusiastic about things and starts trying to figure</v>

143
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>things out and working towards and achieving like little goals,</v>

144
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you get invigorated.</v>

145
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's this feeling of invigoration whenever your pursue anything that you find to</v>

147
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 1>be fun.</v>

148
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you find to be stimulating,</v>

149
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>but the real thing is like everybody's idea of what stimulating is different.</v>

150
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>It just is thanking God and the real problem is like that poor kid is fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>And his father's like Bali,</v>

182
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.383
<v Speaker 1>Bali,</v>

183
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.540
<v Speaker 1>like he can't believe it.</v>

184
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:18.221
<v Speaker 1>He's so angry.</v>

185
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

186
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Bali,</v>

187
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>my son's going to do follow my,</v>

190
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>But that's what he is.</v>

00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking ballet dancer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a great movie.</v>

193
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You got to find out what you grow,</v>

194
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>what you groove is.</v>

195
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>What's your groove?</v>

197
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Is it playing the drums?</v>

198
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the truth.</v>

199
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>What is it your truth?</v>

200
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>If you try to,</v>

201
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if you try to avoid it,</v>

202
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get yourself in some,</v>

203
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be on antidepressants.</v>

204
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to mask that,</v>

205
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:42.521
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

206
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:42.971
<v Speaker 1>that true.</v>

207
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Just do what you're supposed to.</v>

208
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing that there's no one that's ever come out with a really effective</v>

209
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>guidebook of how to live life in a successful direction like no one could ever</v>

210
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>tell you how to be successful.</v>

211
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>What is successful to you is not successful someone else,</v>

212
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.771
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

213
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

214
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>but to teach you how to manage the whole big package.</v>

216
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

217
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.041
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

218
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:12.041
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of managing the thoughts in your mind is just missing from</v>

219
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:14.070
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

220
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>This did I have to just tell you I'm laughing because when,</v>

221
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 1>when people are self conscious,</v>

222
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:19.471
<v Speaker 1>like in my class,</v>

223
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:21.160
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Richard Lawson is acting teacher.</v>

224
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who was like,</v>

225
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 1>whenever I like this guy,</v>

226
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy was like embarrassed that he'd done something.</v>

227
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

228
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:26.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

229
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just embarrassed by it and my teacher goes like this.</v>

230
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.130
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

231
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.963
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

232
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I fucked the pig.</v>

233
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.461
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

234
00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:32.761
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

235
00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:32.921
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

236
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

237
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

238
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I fucked the pig.</v>

239
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing about it right now.</v>

240
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that's embarrassing.</v>

241
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you everything about myself.</v>

242
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I've fucked a pig when I was a kid.</v>

243
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.113
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

244
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And everybody just stopped.</v>

245
00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

246
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

247
00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:44.791
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

248
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to admit that I can make,</v>

249
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I can admit fucking anything.</v>

250
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And it just liberates you when like somebody who's a leader in a group goes,</v>

251
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:51.631
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

252
00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:51.871
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

253
00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:52.111
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

254
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>in case you guys,</v>

255
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>can everybody stop acting like a fucking Puritan,</v>

256
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.610
<v Speaker 1>cause we're all pretty fucked up and,</v>

257
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.941
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

258
00:06:56.941 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the most fucked up.</v>

259
00:06:58.201 --> 00:06:58.531
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

260
00:06:58.531 --> 00:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

261
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.170
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if there was a point to that,</v>

262
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

263
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

264
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>which has kind of piggybacking on what you're trying to say,</v>

265
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:04.740
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially,</v>

266
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.791
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

268
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.980
<v Speaker 1>just whatever your fucking truth is,</v>

269
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 1>just be honest with yourself and maybe with a couple of your friends and then</v>

270
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>just fucking follow that.</v>

271
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
