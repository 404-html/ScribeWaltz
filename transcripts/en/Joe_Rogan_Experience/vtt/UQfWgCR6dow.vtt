00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's societal standards and culture is</v>

2
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of this.</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>The way people decide what's acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not acceptable.</v>

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>So to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for us growing up in America,</v>

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would be like to be living in</v>

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most radicalized parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world can understand the radical</v>

7
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I have no problem saying</v>

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that a guy who went and did nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>became radicalized.</v>

9
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Like to me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrote mathematical equation</v>

10
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard one because you know,</v>

12
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>people still say to this day and age</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>

14
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

15
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the counter insurgency strategy is based</v>

16
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>off winning the hearts of minds of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were going into the</v>

17
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>countries that we're going into.</v>

18
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think the only way that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it that makes sense to people</v>

19
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>with it might at least allow them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think outside of the education aspect.</v>

20
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of,</v>

21
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you alluded to the point a little bit,</v>

22
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you have daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you love your daughters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Like how much though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like articulate for me how much you</v>

25
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for anybody to ever</v>

26
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>express it in a way that someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have daughters would ever</v>

27
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>understand or sons or children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

28
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And so love is a good analogy because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand how hard it is to</v>

29
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>articulate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you understand that there's another</v>

30
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>side of that coin and that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community of people somewhere on earth</v>

31
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that hates you to the exact same degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you love your children and can't</v>

32
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>articulate and would do everything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking can to end our way of life.</v>

33
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Because we let women go outside and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skin exposed.</v>

34
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>You can say what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think what you want.</v>

35
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And what's the solution to solve that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not books.</v>

36
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>There's not as a single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

37
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I could put you in captivity for 14</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

38
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Joe and I could never convince you not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live your daughters.</v>

39
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

40
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>this is not our job to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying,</v>

41
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.073
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me what happened?</v>

42
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is though is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that there's,</v>

43
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>there's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

44
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go over there and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to fight.</v>

45
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Well fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point you have to stand up for</v>

46
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>what you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

47
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate you as much as you love your kids,</v>

48
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a small segment of that that you</v>

49
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>could probably turn with books in</v>
<v Speaker 1>captivity,</v>

50
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Which is what's happening to the guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get radicalized and get Mo.</v>

52
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>But for the other segment that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nothing more than to end your life</v>

53
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and everything you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the solution?</v>

54
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not fucking books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

55
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>What is the solution to try to turn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy around once they've reached that</v>

56
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radicalization he can't.</v>

57
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>So you either have to find something or</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in something to the point that</v>

58
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to fight for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because here's the deal.</v>

59
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>We're x people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's why people,</v>

60
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>and regardless of what your x is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Christian Catholic,</v>

61
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>whatever your next person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's somebody who's a white person,</v>

62
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>x and y people are going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in what you believe</v>

63
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to protect that at some point</v>

64
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to go beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational aspect of that.</v>

65
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time it's the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts.</v>

66
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

67
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn,</v>

68
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>you learn a lot about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like listening to you listen to your own</v>

69
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you to the good ones.</v>

70
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

71
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no desire to listen to myself.</v>

72
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>The only time is when I'm going through</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastering the system,</v>

73
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>my tutorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do sit there and I am interested in</v>

74
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>how I'm teaching and what I said and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have made the point clear in my</v>

75
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

76
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only time,</v>

77
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>but when it's a podcast and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about you did sit and I'm just</v>

78
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>talking about like just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear myself.</v>

79
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 2>It's good to hear though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the same reason like you realize</v>

80
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>why you were annoying to you like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

81
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I've found things that I didn't know I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did like little s little ticks,</v>

82
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>little weird things like people do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big one is saying like people like</v>

83
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 2>there's like Tom Segura I loved him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

84
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker out likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hurts me sometimes.</v>

85
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's like a way like if you got</v>

86
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like in his like a way like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

87
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.460

<v Speaker 2>what guys are telling a story.</v>

88
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

89
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>she came up to me and started mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogging me and I was like,</v>

90

91
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't say none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said I was like that.</v>

92
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I had that look on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't say shit.</v>

93
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't question did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually say that?</v>

94
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.861
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
