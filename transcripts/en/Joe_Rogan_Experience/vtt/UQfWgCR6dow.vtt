00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's societal standards and culture is a</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>big part of the way people decide what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>what's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to these people.</v>

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I think for us growing up in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to understand</v>

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>what it would be like to be living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most radicalized parts</v>

6
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>of the world can understand the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>which is why I have no problem saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a guy who went and did nothing but</v>

8
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>became radicalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to me that's,</v>

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a mathematical equation right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard one because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still say to this day and age</v>

12
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't kill,</v>

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to.</v>

15
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>The counter insurgency strategy is based</v>
<v Speaker 1>off winning the hearts and minds of the</v>

16
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>people that were going into countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going into.</v>

17
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think the only way that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it that makes sense to people</v>

18
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>where that might at least allow them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think outside of the education aspect.</v>

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of,</v>

20
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you alluded to the point a little bit,</v>

21
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you have daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you love your daughters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Like how much though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like articulate for me how much you</v>

24
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for anybody to ever</v>

25
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>express it in a way that someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have daughters would ever</v>

26
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>understand or sons or children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally and so love is a good analogy</v>

27
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>because if you can understand how hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to articulate that,</v>

28
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>then you understand that there's another</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of that coin and that there's a</v>

29
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:26.721
<v Speaker 1>community of people somewhere in earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hates you to the exact same degree</v>

30
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>that you love your children and can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate and would do everything they</v>

31
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking can to end our way of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we let women go outside and have</v>

32
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>their skin exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say what you want.</v>

33
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You can think what you want and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution to solve that.</v>

34
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single.</v>

35
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could put you in captivity for 14</v>

36
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe and I could never convince you not</v>

37
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>to love your daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not our job to change,</v>

39
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on little whatever.</v>

40
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is though is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that there's just like,</v>

41
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go over there and you</v>

42
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>don't have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well fuck that.</v>

43
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>At some point you have to stand up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you believe in.</v>

44
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to those people that</v>

45
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>hate you as much as you love your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

46
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a small segment of that that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could probably turn with books in</v>

47
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Which is what's happening to the guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get radicalized and get mo,</v>

49
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>but for the other segment that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nothing more than to end your life</v>

50
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>and everything you believe in.</v>

51
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>What's the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fucking books.</v>

52
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the solution to try to turn a</v>

53
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>guy around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they've reached that level of</v>

54
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>radicalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>

55
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So you either have to find something or</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in something to the point that</v>

56
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to fight for it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal,</v>

57
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>we're x people and then there's white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and regardless of what your x is,</v>

58
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>your Christian Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your next person,</v>

59
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>there's somebody as a white person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x and y people are going to fight.</v>

60
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in what you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

61
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>then to protect that at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to go beyond the</v>

62
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>educational aspect of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time the podcast art.</v>

63
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

64
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn,</v>

65
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you learn a lot about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm listening to you,</v>

66
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>listen to your own podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to the good one.</v>

67
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

68
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no desire to listen to myself.</v>

69
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>The only time is when I'm going through</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastering the system,</v>

70
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>my tutorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do sit there and I am interested in</v>

71
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>how I'm teaching and what I said and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have made the point clear in my</v>

72
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

73
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the only time but when it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and I'm not talking about you</v>

75
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 2>did sit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about like,</v>

76
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear myself.</v>

77
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 2>It's good to hear though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the same reason like you realize</v>

78
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>why you're annoying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>

79
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I've found things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I did like little little</v>

80
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 2>ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little weird things like people do like</v>

81
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 2>a big one is saying like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's like Tom said,</v>

82
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them to death but that mother</v>

83
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>fucker out likes me.</v>

84
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 2>He hurts me sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's like a way,</v>

85
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 2>like if you got like a guy like in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a way like oh did he say that?</v>

86
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Or everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you guys are telling a story,</v>

87
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

88
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>she came up to me and started mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogging me and I was like,</v>

89

<v Speaker 2>I paid for all that shit.</v>

90
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't say none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said I was like that.</v>

91
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I had that look on my right but I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>say shit.</v>

92
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you actually say that you're like,</v>

93
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not.</v>

94
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking</v>

95
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have made it seem like a bad</v>

96
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In reality,</v>

97
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you didn't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

98
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 2>fuck you for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that.</v>

99
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it.</v>

100
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

101

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

103
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

104
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Another one that I.</v>
