1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.763
You don't play music.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.873
Okay.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.470
The Joe Rogan experience.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.690
<v 0>Try my day.</v>

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.420
Joe Rogan podcast by night,

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.623
all day.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.790
All the way from how many miles above the arctic circle.

8
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.821
<v 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:23.540
they are saying it's 197 miles north of the Arctic circle.

10
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.051
I see.

11
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.450
It's a few more God.

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.320
<v 2>So somewhere around 200 miles.</v>

13
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:28.650
Yeah.

14
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.630
Jesus fucking Christ.

15
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.990
What,

16
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.720
what led you folks who are just tuning in right now?

17
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.140
Sue Akins from life below zero a which is one of my favorite shows.

18
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:39.480
I love that show.

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.600
It's the realest at all those shows.

20
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.280
It seems to be the realist.

21
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.930
There's so many of these shows that they'll do like the subsistence living

22
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.231
shows,

23
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.900
but you know that they're setting up fake scenarios.

24
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:52.201
You know,

25
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.850
that there's some producer fuckery and

26
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 1>oh yeah.</v>

27
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.921
There,

28
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.920
there are some things that some shows out there that are,

29
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.640
um,

30
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.440
I would say very heavily scripted.

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.010
Yeah.

32
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.270
You know,

33
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.530
you're,

34
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.950
you're told what you're going to be doing,

35
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.770
not,

36
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.700
but this show,

37
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.010
uh,

38
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.361
and it's a,

39
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.740
it's one of my things in my contract.

40
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.270
I don't do script at anything.

41
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.040
I never want to hear how,

42
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:10.221
oh,

43
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.930
wouldn't that look great if you fell through the river?

44
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:12.920
Cause I'll be like junk.

45
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.940
Luggers see how it feels.

46
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:14.774
I'm not doing it.

47
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.500
You know,

48
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.400
there's enough interesting stuff that happens naturally that you don't have to

49
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.870
script a lot of action.

50
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.501
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:22.370
I would imagine.

52
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.970
I mean,

53
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.970
where you're living is one of the most bizarre remote places on Earth for folks

54
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.110
who have never seen this show.

55
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.831
Uh,

56
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:35.831
it follows a series of people that live in some pretty incredibly remote

57
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:38.270
locations in Alaska.

58
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.070
But you are the most Ramon,

59
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.920
you're the gangster.

60
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.520
The gangster.

61
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.251
Yeah.

63
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.170
I'm the queen of the bad ass.

64
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.351
Are you,

65
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:45.370
when it comes to remote,

66
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.151
you know,

67
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:47.350
my closest city,

68
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.621
uh,

69
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:49.900
where you could find a Walmart is 500 miles south.

70
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.040
And uh,

71
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.710
when you take a plane from Fairbanks to camp,

72
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.880
once you hit the air,

73
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.630
that's it.

74
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.270
You don't see another building until you get to my camp.

75
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.890
What led you the spot?

76
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.720
Even when I,

77
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.261
you know,

78
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:02.891
I say in,

79
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.650
in preschool and kindergarten in the early to mid sixties,

80
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.350
when they ask you what do you want to be when you grow up,

81
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.831
you know,

82
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.450
for a girl at that time period,

83
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:10.781
you know,

84
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:11.920
it was pretty standard,

85
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:12.131
you know,

86
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:12.970
wife and mother.

87
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.220
For me it was a light housekeeper.

88
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.730
I've always craved extreme isolation.

89
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.130
This is just an extension of that.

90
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.210
Why,

91
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.350
what,

92
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.020
um,

93
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.920
what's the attraction?

94
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.551
I,

95
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:25.540
I'm really happy.

96
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:26.410
I like myself.

97
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.120
I crack myself up all the time.

98
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.810
Um,

99
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.820
I'm really comfortable in my own skin.

100
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.290
I like challenges.

101
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.251
If it's,

102
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.070
if there's no challenge in the way that you're living,

103
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.230
you're not really living,

104
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:39.520
you're just kind of beer.

105
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:40.354
Do you want a script?

106
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.660
<v 2>So it's just this attraction to isolation is almost like a natural part of your</v>

107
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:46.960
personality.

108
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.560
<v 1>It is.</v>

109
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.130
It is.

110
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.963
Um,

111
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.350
I,

112
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.970
I really bond with the animals around me.

113
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.571
Uh,

114
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:52.871
you know,

115
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:53.380
and I,

116
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.120
I don't feel that just because it's brown,

117
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:56.050
it has to go down.

118
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.850
I do hunt for the meat that I eat,

119
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.181
but,

120
00:02:58.181 --> 00:02:58.451
you know,

121
00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:00.580
I find where else are you going to go?

122
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.770
My main packable sales 22 in it,

123
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.750
they're not always out to eat me.

124
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.820
So I get to see some pretty amazing things.

125
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.450
Uh,

126
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.601
two,

127
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.770
three winters in a row,

128
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.560
you always have a couple of bears at wake up out of season.

129
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.090
They either didn't store enough fat,

130
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.410
they woke up for some reason,

131
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.940
but once they wake up,

132
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.990
they're straight up killers.

133
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.010
And the past couple of years I've been able to watch a pack of wolves stake down

134
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.844
at grizzly.

135
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.450
Whoa.

136
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.111
And you know,

137
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.190
like this last year,

138
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.660
they just have to get them running.

139
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.110
Cause within a mile or two he's used up all of his calories and there's no way

140
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.040
he's going to survive.

141
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.110
And so when they came running through camp,

142
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.360
crashing into my building as they go,

143
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.130
I'm sitting there on the inside,

144
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:36.371
you know,

145
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.420
with my gun going,

146
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.690
yeah,

147
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.590
come through the wall fucker,

148
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.040
I'll get you.

149
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.401
You know,

150
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.420
but not until they do.

151
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.190
And they went right past and boom,

152
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.230
they took them down on the end of the airstrip and ate them.

153
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.380
So those are things that I get to experience that

154
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.130
for an adrenaline junkie,

155
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.170
somebody that's always pushing the limits,

156
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:53.451
that's,

157
00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:54.460
that's pretty spooked them.

158
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.473
That's pretty good.

159
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.960
<v 3>What,</v>

160
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.370
what was that like?

161
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.170
God had to be insane watching a pack of wolves to take out a,

162
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.891
<v 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.191
and well,

164
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.250
it is because you know it comes at the time of the year when I have 24 hour

165
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:05.880
darkness,

166
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.880
so I only have a limited amount of space where I can see them and then it's

167
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:11.754
gone.

168
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.640
I don't know if they're going to come around and come back inside.

169
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.500
I don't know if they finished it.

170
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.710
I don't know if there's a couple of rogue goals waiting for me to come out.

171
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.671
So you're,

172
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:25.230
your own existence then becomes quite limited to inside until you know that it's

173
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.064
clear.

174
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.540
Yeah.

175
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.420
<v 3>What a fascinating way to live life.</v>

176
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.260
Yeah,

177
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.850
24 hour darkness too.

178
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:32.360
I did that.

179
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.193
I don't even think of it.

180
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.661
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:33.841
Well,

182
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:38.841
my son is going to set a for the last time this next week and in barrel and

183
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:39.991
prude obey,

184
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.510
they get a little bit more sunshine just because,

185
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.780
or in a few more sunsets just because of their location.

186
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.280
They're not around mountains or hills.

187
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.690
I've got a mountain to the north,

188
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:51.120
the south and a mountain range to the east,

189
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.630
so I lose it a couple of weeks before they do and then I won't have another

190
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:55.710
sunrise until March.

191
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.400
<v 3>Wow.</v>

192
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.500
So so did you,

193
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.990
you saw these wolves,

194
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:02.111
are,

195
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.120
you heard them chase down the bear?

196
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.710
Like how do you know what took place?

197
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.060
Did you put a spotlight on it?

198
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.380
<v 1>You get a little bit during this particular time frame that it happened.</v>

199
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.090
You get a little bit of ambient light.

200
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.470
You don't actually have the sun,

201
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.910
but your sky will lighten a little bit.

202
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.410
And even when the moon is out,

203
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:17.951
it lights up.

204
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:19.000
It's an all white landscape.

205
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:19.834
It lights it up.

206
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.490
And I routinely,

207
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.151
even in winter,

208
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:23.830
as long as it's not blowing a gale,

209
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.440
I go up on my rooftops and I'm always looking around.

210
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.520
You always want to give yourself as much advanced notice on anything coming in.

211
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.800
It could be a food source for me,

212
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.260
it could be a a predator,

213
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:35.981
it doesn't matter.

214
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.150
I want to know what's around me.

215
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.540
And that's where I saw something going on there and I saw a big red splotch or

216
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:44.110
what I assumed was red.

217
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.030
And so I know something was bleeding,

218
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.330
something was attacking something and then I could make out as it got closer,

219
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.500
that was a bear running and the wolf pack was in the river and down there's 22

220
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.450
wolves and they just tag them to keep them running.

221
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.980
Once he wears out,

222
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.973
they've got them.

223
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.540
Wow.

224
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.980
They're so clever.

225
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.760
Um,

226
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.760
they are their top predators and their top predators for a reason and they live

227
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.451
in that.

228
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.030
They genetically are predisposed to succeed.

229
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.950
So you know,

230
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:14.870
for me as a human being being there,

231
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.111
you know,

232
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.831
I've got guns,

233
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.850
I've got other things.

234
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.170
But you know,

235
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.430
left to your own devices.

236
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.350
I mean we are nowhere near top Predator

237
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.750
<v 3>and they are the only predators that are that size,</v>

238
00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.010
that act in a pack.

239
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.750
Yes.

240
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.931
Yeah.

241
00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:28.890
They think together,

242
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:30.160
they chase people in [inaudible]

243
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.930
<v 1>following chase animals into a phone or a hierarchy.</v>

244
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.800
You know,

245
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.960
you have the Alphas who controlled the whole thing.

246
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.741
Um,

247
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:38.180
they control who's gonna mate,

248
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.320
who's not going to mate.

249
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.130
And if you,

250
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.120
if you go against the rules,

251
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.050
you're kicked out of the pack.

252
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.980
So then you have rogue wolves and a,

253
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.670
so you got your solitary units.

254
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.391
<v 3>Wow.</v>

255
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:50.160
And you're living in these,

256
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.870
these houses,

257
00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:54.510
the you're living and they seem like they're made out of like cloth or

258
00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:55.010
something.

259
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.401
<v 1>They are,</v>

260
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.980
they're a quonset tents now for,

261
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.814
for clients.

262
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.430
In order for me to be there as a Caucasian,

263
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.500
I'm not allowed to own property on the north slope.

264
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.600
So for me to have a lifestyle there,

265
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.930
I have to lease land from the state and have a profitable business.

266
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.240
If the business stops being profitable,

267
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.650
they have the right to eject me.

268
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.640
So there's,

269
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.061
you know,

270
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:14.721
and people say,

271
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:14.841
oh,

272
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.630
it's reverse discrimination and you have to stop right there.

273
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:19.160
There is no forward or reverse.

274
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.361
It is a fact.

275
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.350
I knew that going in.

276
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.880
And um,

277
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.840
so it's a challenge.

278
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:24.830
It just becomes a challenge.

279
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:25.370
So I,

280
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.850
I,

281
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.650
the clients can stay in the trailers.

282
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.360
There's a bear proof,

283
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.440
soundproof trailers,

284
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.274
they can stand.

285
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.690
Now if I stay in that,

286
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.970
it's a very small amount of head space for me.

287
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.090
I don't like that the door is open to the outside world.

288
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.080
You,

289
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.470
you have to get your life down to all of the doors.

290
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:46.130
My final door going to the outside world opens inside because I Guarantee 15,

291
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.150
20 times a winter,

292
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.430
I'm going to open that door and it's a wall of snow.

293
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:51.620
I have to dig a tunnel so I can get out and open the,

294
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.130
you know,

295
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:52.490
have,

296
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.630
uh,

297
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.930
an an open space.

298
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.390
And if I had a door that opened to the outside world,

299
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.553
I wouldn't get out.

300
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.120
So I've trapped myself.

301
00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.991
But,

302
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.320
uh,

303
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.460
the tent that I live in,

304
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:01.851
um,

305
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:03.260
I'm not allowed a permanent structure.

306
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:04.094
So I have a tent.

307
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.830
And so not allowed a permanent structure?

308
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.251
No,

309
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.380
because I'm leasing the land and you have to,

310
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.360
everything has to be mobile in case they,

311
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:12.230
for whatever reason,

312
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.250
tell you your lease is up.

313
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:14.084
You need to leave.

314
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.680
So everything either is on tracks or it's a tent that you can take down or

315
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.660
something you're willing to throw a match on and burn.

316
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.640
You're not allowed to have a permanent structure.

317
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.220
<v 3>That's a strange set of rules,</v>

318
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:24.900
isn't it?

319
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.161
I mean,

320
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:26.920
it seems like no houses permanent.

321
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:28.510
They've knocked down houses all the time.

322
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:29.010
And the,

323
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.210
even the term permanent is kind of weird.

324
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.521
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.570
But Alaska still,

326
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.180
I mean if you want to break it down,

327
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.650
I mean we still have squatters rights.

328
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:37.310
We still have,

329
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.670
you know,

330
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.001
if you,

331
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:42.410
if you're allowed permanent structures then perhaps you're allowing a squatters

332
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.630
rights situation to,

333
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.483
to develop.

334
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.090
I don't really care about the background rules,

335
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:47.391
I just,

336
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:49.730
just tell me what the rules are and I'll meet the challenge.

337
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.470
Wow.

338
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.350
<v 3>And so you're in these tents,</v>

339
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.060
how easy would it be for an animal?

340
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
Get into the tent?

341
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.883
<v 1>One Swipe.</v>

342
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.871
It's just a,

343
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.171
you know,

344
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.310
figure you're a Coleman tent,

345
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:01.680
maybe a little bit thicker material and that's it.

346
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.820
So any,

347
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.001
well,

348
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.130
it's like the bear that I got this last year that,

349
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:05.490
um,

350
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.230
the background of that my dog was outside in her house and the bear came up,

351
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.460
tore her little house out,

352
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:11.761
hockey,

353
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:13.230
puck it around the pad,

354
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.130
tried to eat her,

355
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.200
chased after some kids that were camping.

356
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.610
So it became after the bear attack that I had a few years ago,

357
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.240
um,

358
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.010
there was a certain fear factor.

359
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.320
I did not aggressively go get bears.

360
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:25.861
I waited,

361
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:25.981
hey,

362
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:27.090
if you come through my wall,

363
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:27.871
I'll take care of you,

364
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:28.410
but I'm not.

365
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.801
And you know,

366
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.060
there was a fear factor.

367
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.631
Well,

368
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.560
now as an owner,

369
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.210
I can't afford to be passive.

370
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.540
This bear PR presented a danger to my dog,

371
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.060
but also more importantly to clients camping.

372
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.550
So I had to go proactive and uh,

373
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.530
it was 16 and a half hours of tracking,

374
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.160
um,

375
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.320
belly crawling over 800 yards.

376
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.910
And then I coughed and he turned on me.

377
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:51.781
Well,

378
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:51.921
the,

379
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:54.030
the long and short of that story was,

380
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:54.360
um,

381
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.590
I just got the hide back.

382
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.690
Now his claws are five and a half inches long.

383
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.850
So one swipe and it's done five and a half inches long.

384
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:03.030
Yeah.

385
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.140
And he's almost nine foot.

386
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.580
Wow.

387
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.181
So,

388
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.020
and as measurements,

389
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:07.321
he,

390
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:07.770
uh,

391
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.910
from what I understand,

392
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:12.780
he's number five in the world for inland grizzly and people wanted me to,

393
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.260
you know,

394
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.030
there was a push to do the Boone and Crockett thing and I'm like,

395
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.920
number five,

396
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.341
you know,

397
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:18.061
if he's the one or two,

398
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:18.660
I'll do it,

399
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.961
you know,

400
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.570
a number five still pretty damn impressive.

401
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.021
Yeah.

402
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:22.231
Yeah.

403
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:22.500
He,

404
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.771
he,

405
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:24.120
he wasn't impressive specimen.

406
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:25.740
He was over 34 years old.

407
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:26.851
So,

408
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:27.241
you know,

409
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:27.511
I mean,

410
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:27.721
this,

411
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:31.140
this was a bear that was probably getting closer to the end of a shelf life and

412
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:32.310
was going to attack anything.

413
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.200
When they get ready to den,

414
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.620
it's,

415
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.580
it's almost,

416
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:35.850
um,

417
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.920
a certain insanity that they reach where,

418
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:38.420
you know,

419
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.861
they,

420
00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:41.280
they're going into hibernation and all's they think is,

421
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:41.911
I've got to eat.

422
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:42.660
I've got to get fat.

423
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.321
I've got to eat,

424
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.190
I've got to get fat.

425
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.570
If you are,

426
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.620
you know,

427
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.251
I always say,

428
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.330
don't act like a pork chop.

429
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.790
If you're acting like a pork chop your in their sites.

430
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.090
So you were attacked by a bear.

431
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:54.890
Yep.

432
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.570
And was that in a camp that was at Kavach.

433
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.530
Um,

434
00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.221
and I,

435
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.170
and I don't talk a whole lot about it.

436
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:01.351
I mean,

437
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:02.250
people always ask about,

438
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.780
yeah,

439
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:05.761
you know,

440
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:07.530
I try to talk about it in the third person.

441
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.220
I get my water from the Catholic river and at a certain point the water's gonna

442
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.640
freeze over while I had one more shot at getting some water.

443
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.310
So I went down and when I have to do is get a pump,

444
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.030
both hands have to be used to get it in the river and start it up.

445
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.970
And I had a juvenile bear that had been,

446
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.060
every night he'd come and he'd go to my helicopter pad,

447
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.630
dig it up,

448
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.141
barriers,

449
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:28.501
food,

450
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:29.334
and run off.

451
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.950
I could see where he was going and where he was coming from.

452
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.510
And when a bear does that,

453
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:37.440
he's trying to claim your territory as a juvenile bear between three and seven

454
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:38.274
years old.

455
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:38.581
You know,

456
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:39.301
he's not hot enough.

457
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:40.290
The chicks don't want him.

458
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.190
He's not alpha enough.

459
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:42.390
He's not kicking any other bears.

460
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:43.020
But,

461
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.880
but I have this prime territory.

462
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.560
At no matter how careful I am,

463
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.820
it always smells like food.

464
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.010
It has cooled then as you don't have to dig,

465
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:51.060
it's a prime place.

466
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.830
And so it's an Alpha pushy.

467
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:57.760
The first step on the Alpha ladder is subjugate something and take over their

468
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:58.594
territory.

469
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.730
And so I'm the long and short.

470
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:01.570
I was getting my water.

471
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:06.571
I sat down my rifle and he was hiding in the cut bank and snatched me up and

472
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.761
you know,

473
00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:11.061
he,

474
00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:12.290
he rolls with you.

475
00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:13.310
He'll open his draws,

476
00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:14.240
put it on your throat,

477
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.000
you can still feel here in here where I ended up having a soul,

478
00:12:17.001 --> 00:12:17.870
my head together,

479
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.010
um,

480
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.371
the door,

481
00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.660
the hips out of the sockets,

482
00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:22.970
and then he ended up going back in the river.

483
00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:26.360
And older bear or a female would have just eaten me and,

484
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.021
and that's,

485
00:12:27.021 --> 00:12:27.480
you know,

486
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.960
an an eye except that in my lifestyle,

487
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:30.950
um,

488
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.970
I knew I was injured,

489
00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:34.130
did not remember I had a rifle by the river,

490
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.510
got myself back to camp.

491
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:38.270
I knew my hips weren't in good shape and he was going to come back and finish

492
00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:39.104
the job.

493
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.370
What he did was kicked me out of my property than I am lower than he is on the

494
00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:45.320
totem pole and he has my territory.

495
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.030
So I got my gun belt,

496
00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:48.330
ratcheted it on the hips,

497
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.340
tried.

498
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.320
I remember calling one person.

499
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.590
I was told I called more than one person for help.

500
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.011
Um,

501
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:55.641
the troopers,

502
00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.910
I got the answering machine because they're out doing other things.

503
00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.631
And,

504
00:12:59.631 --> 00:12:59.840
uh,

505
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.010
I called some other people.

506
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:01.281
I didn't,

507
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.400
I don't remember that I tried to get ahold of the oil companies to say I'd been

508
00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:06.620
attacked and they did not help.

509
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.640
Um,

510
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.391
but I went back,

511
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:09.224
got a rifle,

512
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.150
found where the bear was shot him.

513
00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:11.960
GPS didn't,

514
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.920
I don't know why I did that,

515
00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:14.120
but it was important at the time.

516
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.820
And then the hips gave out on the way back over.

517
00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:19.080
So I drug myself to the camp and,

518
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:19.151
uh,

519
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:20.840
I laid there 10 days until somebody found me.

520
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.160
Whoa.

521
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.660
So Day.

522
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.603
Yeah.

523
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.371
And it's a memory.

524
00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.204
I don't,

525
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.900
I mean at that,

526
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.370
that's going to be with me forever.

527
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.910
Um,

528
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.440
I had an ob flown out once.

529
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.273
I was found,

530
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.550
they flew me to Fairbank's,

531
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.130
then they flew me to the lower world for immediate surgery and my kids did get

532
00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:40.160
to see me in that shape and that was hard on them.

533
00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:40.994
And too,

534
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.230
now that definitely brought it into perspective that I may be the first in the

535
00:13:45.231 --> 00:13:46.064
family to go.

536
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.290
And so they had to deal with that.

537
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.120
You,

538
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.040
did you have any thoughts of abandoning that lifestyle when that happened?

539
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.113
I,

540
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.060
you know,

541
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.420
it,

542
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:57.641
it,

543
00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:58.131
it became,

544
00:13:58.131 --> 00:14:00.860
because I was working for the company that I later bought the camp from.

545
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.193
Um,

546
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.730
it was a workman's comp case.

547
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.030
Uh,

548
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.050
they put the hips in,

549
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.880
they had to do one twice and they took a couple of disks out and then the

550
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.970
insurance company said,

551
00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:11.121
well,

552
00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:12.290
we're not going to do any more work.

553
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:13.310
You've got to get a lawyer.

554
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.511
And I,

555
00:14:14.511 --> 00:14:14.751
you know,

556
00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:15.051
I'm like,

557
00:14:15.051 --> 00:14:15.500
why?

558
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.311
I'm not arguing.

559
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:18.860
The company's not arguing either as a fucking Barry's dead.

560
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.241
And they said,

561
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:21.320
that's just the way it goes.

562
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.090
And my personality was,

563
00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:23.361
well,

564
00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:24.200
how about if you go to hell,

565
00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:25.034
I'm going home.

566
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.941
So,

567
00:14:25.941 --> 00:14:26.330
uh,

568
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.141
I called the owner,

569
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:27.471
he said,

570
00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:27.621
yeah,

571
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:28.550
if you think you can do it.

572
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.151
And I said,

573
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:33.920
there's only one way I had to accept that there's 83 tag grizzlies within 10

574
00:14:33.921 --> 00:14:34.754
miles of camp.

575
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.440
At any point they can decide to charge camp or come in aggressively.

576
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.940
Um,

577
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.610
it's only a matter of time before I do get charged again.

578
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.140
So that's my test.

579
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:45.861
When it happens,

580
00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:48.290
how am I going to react if I hesitate at all?

581
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.000
I have no business being there.

582
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.460
I can't perform job it takes to be there.

583
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.980
But when it did happen,

584
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.731
I was able to,

585
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:56.630
I took care of the bear.

586
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.350
It was just automatic response so I knew I would be okay.

587
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.641
But you know,

588
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.150
there's,

589
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.710
how many injuries do you have?

590
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:03.891
A,

591
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:04.191
you know,

592
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:07.100
when your head stops being able to get in the game and take care of it.

593
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.510
And then that's when I have to leave.

594
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.530
<v 3>You said that they had to take some disks out and I've got several discs</v>

595
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.240
<v 1>that out.</v>

596
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.520
Um,

597
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.730
but of your back?

598
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.150
Yeah,

599
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.950
on the spine and a,

600
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.810
I still have more,

601
00:15:18.811 --> 00:15:19.740
there's more work to do.

602
00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:20.551
But as,

603
00:15:20.551 --> 00:15:21.240
um,

604
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.511
you know,

605
00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:22.460
not to diss the,

606
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:24.960
the Workman's compensation thing,

607
00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:25.860
but it's,

608
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.890
it's really not set up to help the people that set up to help the insurance

609
00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:29.640
companies.

610
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.520
So I've just gone without the medical attention and,

611
00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:32.820
uh,

612
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.010
I know I can't twist and bend very often.

613
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.830
I know what some of my limits are and I try to work around it.

614
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.391
<v 3>Well.</v>

615
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:42.410
So do you have bulging discs or when you say disks when out?

616
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.170
Yeah,

617
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.561
<v 1>bit out.</v>

618
00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:45.690
There's one that spit out a pretty hard,

619
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.880
I'm twisting into the right is not good.

620
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.841
I have to,

621
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:49.621
when I lift things,

622
00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:52.230
I have to be careful because when the bear got me,

623
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.240
Eh,

624
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.073
um,

625
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.000
he's twisting and your body's just not meant to do that.

626
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.300
It's an outside force applying pressure and twisting.

627
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.260
It's not a good thing.

628
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.430
So,

629
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.390
but as with anything,

630
00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:07.051
it's like for me,

631
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:10.740
I was later a couple of years later working on the overhead electrics and fell

632
00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:12.150
straight down from 22 feet.

633
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.410
Bro broke both ankles and the bones in my right leg and a,

634
00:16:16.411 --> 00:16:19.290
and that's where at the beginning of the episodes you see that I'm having

635
00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:20.820
surgery and coming back to camp.

636
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.260
Um,

637
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.840
I've since had a few more things that I've had to look at.

638
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.501
You know,

639
00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:27.720
you beat up your body so much and I'm not,

640
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.890
I'm not a spring chicken.

641
00:16:28.891 --> 00:16:30.420
I mean I'm not the crypt keeper,

642
00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:30.931
but you know,

643
00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:31.141
I'm,

644
00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:34.980
I'm going on 52 at some point my body's going to say,

645
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:35.600
bitch,

646
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.391
you want to do that?

647
00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:37.950
Do it on your own cause I'm checking out.

648
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.181
You know,

649
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:39.661
so you,

650
00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:40.410
you must,

651
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.730
if you're going to do this lifestyle,

652
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.350
you must always assess,

653
00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:43.951
reassess,

654
00:16:43.951 --> 00:16:46.110
and be extremely honest with who you are,

655
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.200
what your limitations are and how can you work within those.

656
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.380
<v 3>It's just such a strange life to be drawn to,</v>

657
00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:53.940
not just to be isolated like that,

658
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:56.400
but to be isolated in is really vulnerable way.

659
00:16:56.401 --> 00:16:57.750
We're in your intense,

660
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.960
it's so crazy.

661
00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:02.250
It's not for everybody.

662
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.210
It's fuck yes.

663
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:11.030
I would imagine it's for like one of the smallest percentages of people on the

664
00:17:11.581 --> 00:17:12.120
planet.

665
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.700
But you're very personable.

666
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.200
You're very friendly,

667
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.580
you're very smart.

668
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.470
So you,

669
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.890
you,

670
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.890
you're not like this fucking Ted Kaczynski Wacko living in the witness shining.

671
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.451
Yeah.

672
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:25.230
You know what I'm saying?

673
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.520
It's like you seem like a person who enjoys being around people.

674
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:29.941
<v 1>You know,</v>

675
00:17:29.941 --> 00:17:32.220
people assume that because I live alone,

676
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.170
I am antisocial or I'm running away from something and that's not the case.

677
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:37.591
You know,

678
00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:42.330
I run to a lifestyle that I enjoy and I really enjoy being social,

679
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.670
but I like to know when it's going to start in,

680
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:45.504
when it's going to end.

681
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.020
I don't want to live extremely social,

682
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.370
but um,

683
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.570
I love engaging in it.

684
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.410
And then you know,

685
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:53.131
like a hit and run,

686
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:53.721
I know when to,

687
00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:54.554
I know when to leave.

688
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.071
<v 2>Right?</v>

689
00:17:55.071 --> 00:17:56.330
So you'll come into town,

690
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.710
hang out with people,

691
00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:58.181
talk,

692
00:17:58.181 --> 00:17:58.501
and they go,

693
00:17:58.501 --> 00:17:58.881
okay,

694
00:17:58.881 --> 00:17:59.870
you guys take care.

695
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.130
I'm just going to be by myself.

696
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.030
10.

697
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:02.631
Well,

699
00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:03.500
and then you know,

700
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:04.190
you,

701
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.780
no matter where you live,

702
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.570
it's a good idea.

703
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.430
When you're in a social situation,

704
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.590
learn what's healthy for you and what's not.

705
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.020
There may be people that you are quote unquote friends with,

706
00:18:15.021 --> 00:18:15.471
but they're,

707
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:16.304
they're toxic,

708
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:16.761
right?

709
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:16.971
I mean,

710
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.460
cut the toxicity out of your lifestyle and enjoy it.

711
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.091
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

712
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:20.661
without a doubt.

713
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:21.494
That's great advice.

714
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.780
But aren't bears fucking toxic?

715
00:18:23.781 --> 00:18:25.550
His Shit to fairs are bears,

716
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.051
<v 1>you know,</v>

717
00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:27.130
they don't wake up and say,

718
00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:27.461
oh,

719
00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:29.620
that's who I think I'm gonna knock her around today.

720
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.160
Right,

721
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.490
right.

722
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:30.851
I mean,

723
00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:31.141
they,

724
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:34.840
they are animals and there's an instinct and there's a drive to survive.

725
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.200
And sometimes I get in their way and I'm in their sites.

726
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.030
I'm like this summer it,

727
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.370
the troopers even came by several times and said,

728
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.500
we need to know that you have an emergency plan.

729
00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:47.470
This is going to be one of the worst aggressive bear seasons ever.

730
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.760
How the numbers,

731
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.350
because the numbers are so high.

732
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.453
Um,

733
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.241
you know,

734
00:18:52.241 --> 00:18:55.420
as man decides it's going to like the Caribou herd size,

735
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.351
they count it and they go,

736
00:18:56.351 --> 00:18:56.651
oh,

737
00:18:56.651 --> 00:18:57.610
there's too many Caribou.

738
00:18:57.611 --> 00:18:59.530
Let's up the amount that people can harvest.

739
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.251
Well,

740
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:02.830
when they do that and one from two a year to five a year,

741
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.160
um,

742
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.720
in the villages it's 10 a day.

743
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:05.681
Um,

744
00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:06.221
so you're,

745
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:11.080
you're putting all these bones and gut piles out there while you're predators

746
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:12.070
are going to eat those.

747
00:19:12.071 --> 00:19:13.540
And then their numbers are healthier,

748
00:19:13.541 --> 00:19:15.010
they brew reproduce more.

749
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.660
And then all of a sudden,

750
00:19:16.661 --> 00:19:17.261
like this year,

751
00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:19.300
the Caribou migrate it out a full five,

752
00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:20.230
six weeks early.

753
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.470
And so their main food group left the north slope.

754
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.860
So then you have all these bears roaming around and nothing to eat.

755
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.290
But here I am walking around like a little pork chop,

756
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.370
you know.

757
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.180
Um,

758
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.320
but the bears this year I had eight that were circling camp just religiously

759
00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:36.154
every day.

760
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.270
But they never,

761
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.580
they never did anything.

762
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.590
They weren't dickheads.

763
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.131
You know,

764
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:43.390
they didn't come through the walls,

765
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.380
they didn't ran sack.

766
00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:44.621
You know,

767
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.810
I'm very careful with garbage and everything else.

768
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.150
Whatever I have to have in camp,

769
00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:50.170
it has to be flown in.

770
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:50.740
Well,

771
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.030
it's a protected ecosystem.

772
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.460
You can't just go bury your garbage or leave it in bags.

773
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.020
I,

774
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.480
um,

775
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.020
by law have to take all of the garbage and even human waste,

776
00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:00.490
separate liquids and Solids,

777
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.680
burn everything to its lowest lowest ash,

778
00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:03.940
bag it up and send it to town.

779
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.170
So you have to burn poop.

780
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.243
Yes.

781
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.150
That's hilarious.

782
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.171
Well,

783
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:11.140
only if you're not doing the job because I don't want him when I'm doing it.

784
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.453
I'm just saying,

785
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.780
do you have like a furnace?

786
00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:15.280
Like I have a big incinerator.

787
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:15.621
Oh,

788
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:15.910
okay.

789
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.211
Yeah.

790
00:20:16.211 --> 00:20:18.040
I mean it's not the greatest job on the planet,

791
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.850
but it's a job,

792
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.240
right?

793
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.421
Yeah.

794
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:19.751
No,

795
00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:21.850
I mean I don't go cook food.

796
00:20:21.851 --> 00:20:22.990
I'd afterwards I clean out.

797
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.610
Did you have a profitable business up there?

798
00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:24.921
Like what,

799
00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:25.840
what do you do up there?

800
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.800
Uh,

801
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.460
kavach used to be an old oil camp and uh,

802
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.031
now,

803
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:31.301
you know,

804
00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:32.650
my goal is to,

805
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:35.710
I want to be the first 100% green camp in the middle of the oil fields.

806
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.960
So I've turned it into sort of a twisted Ben breakfast.

807
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.080
Um,

808
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.230
it's not a hotel like you'd find here where you have,

809
00:20:41.231 --> 00:20:41.471
you know,

810
00:20:41.471 --> 00:20:43.690
so many story building and these really cool rooms.

811
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.690
They are soundproof bear proof,

812
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.880
like a trailer on,

813
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.840
on tracks that you can stand and it gives you,

814
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.490
now that that's a measure of safety.

815
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.240
Um,

816
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.590
but I rent those rooms out.

817
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.401
If you want food,

818
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.210
I'll cook it for you.

819
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.680
It's always chef's menu,

820
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.410
you know,

821
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.410
you don't get a menu and get to pick from and it's whatever.

822
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:03.490
I feel like cooking that day.

823
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.930
Um,

824
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.110
but that's how I make money now for me to be there.

825
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:08.680
There's,

826
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.090
it's not inexpensive that the dollars that it takes for me to be there,

827
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.960
even to heat.

828
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.160
There is no wood.

829
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.300
I can't do wood heat.

830
00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.320
Um,

831
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.760
so everything has to be oil.

832
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:20.380
So my interest in going,

833
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:20.591
you know,

834
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:24.220
I've got a certain amount of alternative energy now this winter I'm working on a

835
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:28.030
big project and hopefully by next year I'll be 100% green and not needing any

836
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:28.540
fuel.

837
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.750
So is it possible to be solar?

838
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:33.290
I mean when you say a hundred percent green,

839
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.850
um,

840
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.320
well I've already got some solar panels and wind turbine and,

841
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.580
but solar eight,

842
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:41.410
nine months of the year doesn't do me whole lot of good.

843
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.510
But so wind is the major one.

844
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:47.200
So I'm adding in new large scale wind turbines,

845
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.400
more solar.

846
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.070
I will always have to have a generator as a backup.

847
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:51.970
But like for example,

848
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.220
when I first got there working for the other company,

849
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.660
they used a 100 kw generator 24 hours a day every day.

850
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.150
And there's also a 150 kw.

851
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.620
Well that's going to be over a hundred gallons of fuel a day just for the

852
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:07.270
generator to provide electricity.

853
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.200
Wow.

854
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.771
And so,

855
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:09.011
you know,

856
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:10.630
the actual per day,

857
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.550
you're talking between one and 200 gallons a day.

858
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.980
I've got that down to six to 10 gallons a day.

859
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.370
So I've already made a huge stride in making it better.

860
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.240
And how have you done that?

861
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.871
Um,

862
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:20.860
I switched,

863
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.570
I changed all the electrics.

864
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:22.781
You know,

865
00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:26.020
there used to be a theory in the oil fields because some of those companies have

866
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:27.040
a lot of money to spend.

867
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.420
If they don't spend their whole budget,

868
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:29.980
they don't get a new great big budget.

869
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:30.911
So,

870
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:31.090
uh,

871
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.510
there's a,

872
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.900
you know,

873
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.651
theory that you,

874
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.880
you don't need to be more efficient.

875
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:35.290
You obviously just need a bigger gender,

876
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:36.190
more power cords.

877
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.391
So everything,

878
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:38.950
every time you plug in a power cord,

879
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:40.330
you have what's called line loss.

880
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:41.141
You know,

881
00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:41.441
and that's,

882
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:44.530
I guess one of the neatest things about the lifestyle I have is,

883
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.161
you know,

884
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:47.560
I wasn't born knowing how to do diesel mechanics.

885
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:48.221
And I tell people,

886
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:48.431
you know,

887
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:50.560
the only thing I used to know about it is how to bake bread.

888
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.431
In other words,

889
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:51.700
I hadn't,

890
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.780
I knew nothing but I'm learning and it's just like electricity.

891
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.010
I don't like electricity,

892
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.870
but I have to learn how to do it.

893
00:22:58.871 --> 00:22:59.710
So you know,

894
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.000
you learn line loss.

895
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:03.010
If you plug in and keep plugging in extension cords,

896
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:07.510
you may have a hundred kw when you start and you only get 80 kw at your final

897
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:10.180
ending point because you've lost so much of it along the way.

898
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.160
So I improve the electrics,

899
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:13.480
did more direct wiring,

900
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.280
fell and hurt myself in the process,

901
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:16.780
but got back up and did it again.

902
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.800
Um,

903
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.170
learned wind power.

904
00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:23.920
I have a big battery bank and I can store power and use it later.

905
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:28.330
That's a my entire Internet system that I put in a 12 years ago.

906
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.010
It runs off the battery bank.

907
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.020
When you say Internet system,

908
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:32.854
how's that work?

909
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:33.430
Uh,

910
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.750
back when I first got there,

911
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.200
um,

912
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.580
and I was working for the other company,

913
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:36.851
I said,

914
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:37.061
hey,

915
00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:37.900
we got to get Internet.

916
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:38.680
Uh,

917
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.820
the analog phones,

918
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:40.270
Anil,

919
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.750
there's two types of signal for cell phone usage or foams.

920
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.320
You have an analog signal signal in a digital analog travels much further than a

921
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:48.711
digital.

922
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:50.480
Digital only goes 27 miles.

923
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.850
While I'm 83 and a half miles from dead horse,

924
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:53.810
no matter what I do,

925
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:54.860
I can't get it,

926
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.790
throw the signal again.

927
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:59.330
It's still not going to reach me while the government took away the analog

928
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:01.400
signal and privatized it for themselves.

929
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.090
So I knew you're going to have no communications other than a satellite phone,

930
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:06.710
which is horrendously expensive.

931
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.521
So,

932
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:07.691
uh,

933
00:24:07.691 --> 00:24:08.331
I told the owner,

934
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:08.540
I said,

935
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.770
you need the Internet out here,

936
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.251
you know,

937
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:10.900
and he says,

938
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.181
yeah,

939
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:11.571
no,

940
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:12.141
at this point,

941
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:12.621
you know,

942
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:12.920
um,

943
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.960
technology where it was then the,

944
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:17.780
you have to get over the curvature of the earth to clip the satellites.

945
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.550
So he said,

946
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:19.971
if you want it,

947
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:20.804
you're going to pay for it.

948
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.160
Well,

949
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.501
all right,

950
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.241
there's a challenge.

951
00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:23.900
It cost 8,000 bucks to get the dish,

952
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:24.530
fly it up,

953
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.220
get the tech.

954
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.270
And I worked with the geologists to find the bedrock and I bounced a signal off

955
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:31.220
the bedrock and I haven't lost signal yet.

956
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.410
Wow.

957
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.230
So you bounce a satellite signal off the catch it,

958
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.020
this is an off the bedrock rather than people that point at where they think the

959
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:41.070
satellites are going to go.

960
00:24:41.071 --> 00:24:41.641
Like here,

961
00:24:41.641 --> 00:24:46.020
I pointed directly down so as the signals are hitting the bedrock I killed.

962
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.883
I get it.

963
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.340
Okay.

964
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.750
Wow.

965
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.670
So it was a risk.

966
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:52.230
I didn't know how to calculate that.

967
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.000
I brought the geologist in.

968
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.170
I had an idea.

969
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.550
I'm great with ideas,

970
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.700
but I don't know if their bone had ideas or plausible.

971
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.700
Is anyone else doing something similar or is this just completely yours?

972
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:03.810
They may,

973
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.490
they may know nobody was then.

974
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.900
But you just came up with it on your own?

975
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:07.590
Yeah.

976
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.330
Yeah.

977
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.990
I knew what I wanted to do.

978
00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:13.420
I know that basic mechanics of what needs to happen and,

979
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.590
and then I apply Su technology and come up with a suffix,

980
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.730
but I do check with people that are trained in that and they go,

981
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:22.511
yeah,

982
00:25:22.511 --> 00:25:23.920
that might work well.

983
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.371
Okay,

984
00:25:24.371 --> 00:25:26.980
it's worth eight grand for me to check it out.

985
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.190
And what kind of like download speeds do you get up there?

986
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.710
Can you like watch a youtube video?

987
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.000
I can haul.

988
00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:35.050
Although a,

989
00:25:35.051 --> 00:25:37.580
the way they saw the internet there is,

990
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.001
you know,

991
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:38.691
your bandwidth,

992
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:39.261
your bandwidth,

993
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:41.960
you get so many gigs or whatever of bandwidth.

994
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:44.900
When I use that up then it's really expensive,

995
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.520
prohibitively expensive.

996
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.860
But for me to go back to being juggled,

997
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:49.191
Jane,

998
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:50.030
I am a mother,

999
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.900
a grandmother,

1000
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.183
um,

1001
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.580
for me to do this.

1002
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.911
You know,

1003
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.530
I worked very closely with the kids.

1004
00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:57.831
Um,

1005
00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:59.180
we have a loving relationship,

1006
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.991
but you know,

1007
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:00.351
I like,

1008
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:01.460
and having children too,

1009
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:01.701
I mean,

1010
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:03.770
you're dropping these little seeds and they've got to grow.

1011
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.640
Well,

1012
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.770
my personality can throw a pretty big shadow.

1013
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.480
Not many plants grow in the shade.

1014
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.210
I needed to step back so that they could get the sunshine.

1015
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.190
But one of the turnarounds is,

1016
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:15.830
is I need to know that I can communicate with people.

1017
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.010
You can't run a business if nobody can tell you they want to show up.

1018
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.740
So you know,

1019
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.471
it to me,

1020
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:22.640
it was the wave of the future.

1021
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.350
I had to get it figured out and I've,

1022
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.460
if the only thing standing in my way as money while I go out and make it,

1023
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.750
that's such a strange contradiction.

1024
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.800
Isolation,

1025
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.610
but yet you want to come activity.

1026
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.560
Yeah.

1027
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:34.740
Yeah.

1028
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.490
I need to know for myself that the kids and grandkids are okay.

1029
00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:40.440
And we have a system of talking to each other.

1030
00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:41.280
Social media.

1031
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.600
I throw up 10 fingers,

1032
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.130
10 toes know I'm okay.

1033
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:44.881
Six fingers,

1034
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:45.511
four toes.

1035
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:46.410
They know there's a problem,

1036
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.700
you know,

1037
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.660
it's pretty basic.

1038
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.370
And then they also,

1039
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:52.800
we have a phrase and I won't say what it is,

1040
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.060
but there is a key phrase.

1041
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.080
And if the kids or grandkids ever say that to me,

1042
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.910
that means drop what you're doing,

1043
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.900
get here asap.

1044
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.990
And how long does it take you to get the civilization?

1045
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.320
Depends on the time of year to even come down here and do this.

1046
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.250
Um,

1047
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.680
I had a previous engagement in New York City.

1048
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.180
I've been trying on last,

1049
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:12.751
a week ago,

1050
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:13.584
Monday,

1051
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.521
I called and I said,

1052
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:15.360
you need to pull me now.

1053
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:16.560
We're going to get a bad storm.

1054
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.790
And you know,

1055
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:19.680
my original flight out was Saturday.

1056
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:20.070
No,

1057
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.240
what?

1058
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.430
Oh,

1059
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.360
we got days.

1060
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.351
And I was like,

1061
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:22.710
no,

1062
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.431
you really don't.

1063
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:24.510
We got a system coming in.

1064
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:25.890
I need those weather days.

1065
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.001
Well if you,

1066
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:28.380
if somebody in the real world,

1067
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:28.651
you know,

1068
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:31.710
they need to get to the airport a little earlier because maybe it's bad traffic,

1069
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.790
they're talking hours.

1070
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:33.983
Well this is day.

1071
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.870
Today is day 13 of this major blizzard up there.

1072
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.733
And uh,

1073
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.180
I just happened to have a window,

1074
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:42.460
a three hour window where a plane could make it in three hour window.

1075
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:42.950
Yeah.

1076
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.440
And,

1077
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.240
and we just hit it right and I got out.

1078
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.030
The turnaround for me is when I get home,

1079
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.100
I'm calculating that Saturday I'm going to have another window and I hope so

1080
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.160
because that's my way to get back in right now.

1081
00:27:56.161 --> 00:27:56.371
You know,

1082
00:27:56.371 --> 00:28:00.000
I've got a wolverine that's just been acting like a real creep around camp.

1083
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.860
I'm trying to get into things and so I don't know what he's doing while I'm not

1084
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:05.694
there.

1085
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.780
I can't afford to lose all my water and let everything frees up in my tent.

1086
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:11.010
So my heat is still going.

1087
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.020
If that animal gets into my building,

1088
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.660
he's going to knock over my heater and burn my camp down.

1089
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.030
I don't know till I get there what I'm dealing with.

1090
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.880
That might be happening right now could be,

1091
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.680
can you go to Google earth and look at your camp?

1092
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.220
Um,

1093
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.001
I suppose you could,

1094
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:25.680
but you're going to get to a delayed picture.

1095
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:26.670
I believe with Google Earth,

1096
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:29.400
but I do have two webcams and I did check this morning.

1097
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.000
Um,

1098
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.451
it's not,

1099
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:34.560
I can see the dining hall and to the east there actually for the pilots so they

1100
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:37.230
can see the mountains and see where the sky is.

1101
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.280
Um,

1102
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.020
and then I try to update it as I can,

1103
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.251
but uh,

1104
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:42.031
I was able to see,

1105
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:42.271
okay,

1106
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:44.010
I still have a dining hall tits,

1107
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.720
so GC this wolverine.

1108
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:46.470
Ah,

1109
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.891
you can't,

1110
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.420
it's not a live feed on my webcam.

1111
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:48.621
No.

1112
00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:49.360
Do you ever see,

1113
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:49.860
oh,

1114
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.240
I see him almost daily,

1115
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.980
almost dead now.

1116
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.401
You know,

1117
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:54.510
like with me and the animals,

1118
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:55.380
if I need the for,

1119
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.230
I'll go ahead and get them.

1120
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:56.810
Um,

1121
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.560
right now for needing the fur,

1122
00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.850
it's only like,

1123
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.470
I think it was five below zero.

1124
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:04.370
I think five or 10 below zero is the coldest I've gotten so far this year.

1125
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.520
Not Counting Windchill,

1126
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.830
so it's not really cold enough for me.

1127
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:08.250
Um,

1128
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.900
if you're going for a fur bearer,

1129
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.640
then get them on the first prime,

1130
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.050
you know?

1131
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:13.590
Um,

1132
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.710
and as far as not prime and he's just being a wolverine,

1133
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:18.360
he hasn't attacked me as a person.

1134
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.560
He's tried to mango one of the buildings and I do what I can to dissuade him.

1135
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.030
What'd he do?

1136
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:24.863
Um,

1137
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.280
wolverines if they've ever been injured or you've ever angered them or they've

1138
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:30.480
ever gotten trumped on a hunt,

1139
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:33.750
they'll remember that like a gps coordinate and they come back and they keep

1140
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:34.584
trying to attack it.

1141
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.490
Um,

1142
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.060
like them,

1143
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.050
I guess it's a challenge.

1144
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.910
So for whatever reason,

1145
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:42.910
this wolverine has picked one trailer as his nemesis and he goes and he ripped

1146
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:45.220
the angle iron off and twist it into a little not,

1147
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.210
so what I've done is I've tied a little piece of angle iron down there and he

1148
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:51.580
takes that and keeps re tearing it up,

1149
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.600
you know?

1150
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.050
Um,

1151
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.100
so as or later,

1152
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:54.851
yeah,

1153
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:55.870
that's for whatever reason,

1154
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:58.420
that trailer pissed him off one year and I don't know why,

1155
00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.370
but,

1156
00:29:59.370 --> 00:29:59.590
uh,

1157
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.430
and it may,

1158
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.350
I can't afford to lose,

1159
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.520
you know,

1160
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.220
for me to try and replace it is an ungodly amount of money.

1161
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.950
If he doesn't get with the program and leave,

1162
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.240
then you know,

1163
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:10.810
we're going to,

1164
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.520
we're going to be like this and I have to deal with it.

1165
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.360
But right now he can't help being a wolverine.

1166
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.760
I can't help not wanting him to ruin my stuff.

1167
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:19.594
So it's,

1168
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.591
<v 3>do you,</v>

1169
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:22.350
you enjoy having them around in a,

1170
00:30:22.351 --> 00:30:25.420
some sort of a strange way because it gives you something to think about.

1171
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:25.661
I mean,

1172
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:28.660
do you have like a connection with these animals

1173
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.230
drama?

1174
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.621
<v 1>Well,</v>

1175
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:31.951
you know,

1176
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:32.670
it's not,

1177
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.380
you don't connect with a wolverine.

1178
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.243
I mean,

1179
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.001
you could,

1180
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.040
I suppose seen senior show where there's some guy pat and them,

1181
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.090
well that's not my gig.

1182
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.350
Um,

1183
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.330
but I don't think,

1184
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:42.661
you know,

1185
00:30:42.661 --> 00:30:43.800
it'd be like somebody,

1186
00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:46.260
if there was a race of people that you know,

1187
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.130
bigger than we are,

1188
00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:49.530
and they come in and I'm drinking my coffee and he tags my ass.

1189
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:49.831
I mean,

1190
00:30:49.831 --> 00:30:50.790
that would be a bum day.

1191
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.180
I don't see any reason to shoot on animals simply because it exists.

1192
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.490
So what I can do is,

1193
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.670
is hopefully I'll just keep dissuading him and he'll go,

1194
00:30:59.671 --> 00:30:59.921
wow,

1195
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:00.930
she's crabby and she,

1196
00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:03.660
and he leaves or it'll come down to,

1197
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:03.961
yeah,

1198
00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:06.330
I've got to take him out because he's now costing me revenue.

1199
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.690
<v 3>So he might start tearing up a different,</v>

1200
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.080
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1201
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.670
he may or he's going to go in and,

1202
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.170
you know,

1203
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.851
tax a walls.

1204
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:13.061
I mean,

1205
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:14.860
I can only let it go so long,

1206
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.050
but I'm willing to bet that if I keep,

1207
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.471
you know,

1208
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:21.100
he keeps trying to come in and I keep just waiting him sooner or later he's just

1209
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:21.461
going to say,

1210
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:21.851
wow,

1211
00:31:21.851 --> 00:31:23.170
whatever and leave.

1212
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.100
But,

1213
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.430
um,

1214
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.330
I do,

1215
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.470
I do enjoy the animals in their natural habitat.

1216
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.491
I enjoy,

1217
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:30.731
you know,

1218
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:31.630
I've been able to see,

1219
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:32.110
uh,

1220
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.590
one of the moodiest grizzlies up there.

1221
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.483
Um,

1222
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.070
she's tagged and her name is Marty.

1223
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:39.760
Well,

1224
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.750
a couple of years ago,

1225
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.890
and she is,

1226
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:42.101
what,

1227
00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:44.050
38 years old or something like that now.

1228
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.950
Or she was then,

1229
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.430
um,

1230
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.710
but she ended up popping out a couple of babies.

1231
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.480
Now she's the worst mother in the planet,

1232
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:49.781
you know,

1233
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:51.490
she'll let them get two miles away from her.

1234
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.590
And,

1235
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.950
and which for a hiker,

1236
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:56.050
it's real easy to get in the middle of a mama and cubs.

1237
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:57.400
So I try to warn people,

1238
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.160
but I was sitting up there on the roof,

1239
00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.801
a of my,

1240
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:01.970
I call it the perch and I'm watching and hears,

1241
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.350
I'm Marty crawling up the hillside and there's still a snowfield.

1242
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.371
And she goes,

1243
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:07.150
well,

1244
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.980
and slides down here come the two cubs.

1245
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.610
And they just all day long played and they were so loving.

1246
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:13.831
So it's,

1247
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:14.650
it's really,

1248
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:14.861
you know,

1249
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:15.641
it's a dichotomy.

1250
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:17.110
I see the aggressive side,

1251
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:21.280
but I also can appreciate the maternal natural side.

1252
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:21.771
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:32:21.771 --> 00:32:23.170
You knew you were dealing with it,

1254
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.720
the same species that almost killed you.

1255
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.740
You,

1256
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.340
you're watching them play

1257
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:28.961
<v 1>well,</v>

1258
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:29.261
you know,

1259
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:29.441
and,

1260
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:31.510
and even to do the lifestyle at all.

1261
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.820
And I don't care what part of the world,

1262
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:35.130
if you're going to go this remote and,

1263
00:32:35.131 --> 00:32:37.420
and in immerse yourself in their territory,

1264
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.130
you have to be comfortable,

1265
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.153
your own death.

1266
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.380
Not the same as having a death wish.

1267
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.960
But I'm like with my kids and grandkids,

1268
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:48.680
we do one big meal a year and whether it's over the Skype or whatever,

1269
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.341
um,

1270
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:50.174
I tell them,

1271
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.920
tell me three things you can't stand about me.

1272
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:53.390
What did I do that really pissed you off?

1273
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.250
But tell me three good things.

1274
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.440
And I do the same for them.

1275
00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:58.274
And it's,

1276
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.271
you know,

1277
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:00.620
we're just a very honest relationship.

1278
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.490
I have,

1279
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.780
I have accepted that I may die due to either conditions are animals out here and

1280
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.680
I'm okay with that.

1281
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:07.341
That's,

1282
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:07.641
you know,

1283
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:09.140
roll the dice I'm willing to accept,

1284
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.020
but we each year tell each other,

1285
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.130
I love you for this.

1286
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.600
I think you're a Douche bag for that,

1287
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.190
but you know what?

1288
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.810
I am going to miss you when you go.

1289
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.730
And you know,

1290
00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:24.731
over my life I have this big chest and I've been filling it all the cool crazy

1291
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:26.570
things they've ever heard about me.

1292
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.010
And some things are pretty,

1293
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:29.330
I mean there's some things in my life,

1294
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.940
even as a very young person that were really fantastic.

1295
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.390
And so I take the photographs or the proof or whatever and I stuffed it in this

1296
00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:35.751
box.

1297
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:38.750
So when I go they're going to be able to open that for the first time and see,

1298
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.771
oh my God,

1299
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:40.610
that really happened.

1300
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.181
Oh Shit.

1301
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:42.014
Look at that.

1302
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.180
But it'll be a pretty cool chronicle

1303
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.123
<v 3>your light.</v>

1304
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:51.170
Do you find it really rewarding to be out in this incredibly wild environment?

1305
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:52.310
Like when you come to a city,

1306
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:54.590
like you go from that to New York City.

1307
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.540
Is New York City just like a cool little vacation for you and then do you,

1308
00:33:59.541 --> 00:33:59.821
do you,

1309
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:04.821
do you appreciate the wild or do you appreciate New York because of the wild or

1310
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:06.884
both?

1311
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.023
<v 1>Does that make sense?</v>

1312
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.451
You know,

1313
00:34:09.451 --> 00:34:10.320
my lifestyle,

1314
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.870
the challenges I face and overcoming that.

1315
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.163
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1316
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.150
<v 1>There is such pride in yourself that oh my gosh,</v>

1317
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:19.984
I did that.

1318
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.920
How cool is that?

1319
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.853
Um,

1320
00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.220
in being so I was really little.

1321
00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:24.470
I mean,

1322
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:26.530
I terrified of the dark,

1323
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:29.620
but now I live in a place that's dark for nine months out of the year,

1324
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.400
you know?

1325
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:30.731
I mean,

1326
00:34:30.731 --> 00:34:32.050
there are always challenges.

1327
00:34:32.051 --> 00:34:33.970
Know yourself better yourself,

1328
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.013
you know?

1329
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:35.500
Um,

1330
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.850
when I go to a city,

1331
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.583
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1332
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.401
<v 1>a bear.</v>

1333
00:34:40.401 --> 00:34:42.020
I know exactly what he wants from me,

1334
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:43.490
you know,

1335
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.100
pretty much he's either going to eat you or do you want something here?

1336
00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:47.000
I was just passing through,

1337
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:48.380
but it's a pretty honest relationship.

1338
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.071
He wants to eat me.

1339
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:49.904
I don't want them to,

1340
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.330
you go to a big city and I'm used to seeing my horizon.

1341
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.800
I'm always checking things.

1342
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:55.521
There's no trees,

1343
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:56.271
there's no buildings.

1344
00:34:56.271 --> 00:34:56.811
There's nothing.

1345
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:57.980
Tomorrow my horizon,

1346
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.610
I go to New York and you can't go eight feet and you've got a 60 story building.

1347
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:03.320
How the hell do you check your horizon?

1348
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.060
How do you know what's coming at you?

1349
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.470
You see people,

1350
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.360
but you cannot be guaranteed.

1351
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:09.800
When I see a bear and he's charging,

1352
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.060
I know he wants to attack me.

1353
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.460
You see a person walking down the street,

1354
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:17.210
you don't know whether he's going to pull a gun out of his pocket,

1355
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:18.200
shake your hand,

1356
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:19.160
pinch your ass,

1357
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.210
or wave goodbye.

1358
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.200
You don't know.

1359
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.090
So that's a Predator that,

1360
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:23.924
uh,

1361
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.670
I'm pretty impressed people want to be around.

1362
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.831
And I,

1363
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:28.521
when I got here,

1364
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:30.110
I look at all these lights and all these people,

1365
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:30.560
I'm like,

1366
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.161
oh my God.

1367
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:32.390
And they're here on purpose.

1368
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.330
<v 3>Wow.</v>

1369
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1370
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:38.310
<v 3>I always appreciate La when I leave</v>

1371
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.480
<v 2>and go into the wilderness.</v>

1372
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.830
Whenever I go into the Wilderness,

1373
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:43.710
I love being there like a couple times a year,

1374
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:44.250
three,

1375
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.220
three times a year I go hunting and when I come back,

1376
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:52.221
I always really appreciate the city flush toilets are just like cool.

1377
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.401
Oh yeah.

1378
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:58.401
But just being warm and dry and sitting on a couch and watching TV.

1379
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.353
Yeah.

1380
00:35:59.380 --> 00:35:59.561
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:35:59.561 --> 00:35:59.850
There,

1382
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:00.683
there is.

1383
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.870
It is not saying that I've never lived in a social setting or a city.

1384
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:05.830
I certainly have,

1385
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.431
you know,

1386
00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:07.270
the kid's father,

1387
00:36:07.271 --> 00:36:08.260
biological father,

1388
00:36:08.261 --> 00:36:08.501
you know,

1389
00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:11.620
he tried to make it in Alaska and it wasn't the way I live in.

1390
00:36:11.621 --> 00:36:12.381
It wasn't his gig.

1391
00:36:12.381 --> 00:36:13.181
So you're married.

1392
00:36:13.181 --> 00:36:14.770
I went down there and tried to make it in the city.

1393
00:36:14.771 --> 00:36:15.101
That boy,

1394
00:36:15.101 --> 00:36:16.570
that one my Gig for very long.

1395
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:16.830
We,

1396
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.050
you know,

1397
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.590
we were married 17 years and then one day we're laying in bed and he's cracking

1398
00:36:20.591 --> 00:36:20.741
up.

1399
00:36:20.741 --> 00:36:21.101
And I said,

1400
00:36:21.101 --> 00:36:21.281
what?

1401
00:36:21.281 --> 00:36:22.114
And he says,

1402
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:22.750
it's real.

1403
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.140
You know,

1404
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.801
it's real simple.

1405
00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:24.491
You're more grizzly.

1406
00:36:24.491 --> 00:36:24.761
Adams.

1407
00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:25.571
I'm more John Wayne.

1408
00:36:25.571 --> 00:36:26.404
The shit ain't gonna work.

1409
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.970
And so we stayed in the best of friends until he passed away.

1410
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.230
But um,

1411
00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.660
we developed and that's part of me,

1412
00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:35.380
you know,

1413
00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.600
don't sit there and cry and be sad because it ended,

1414
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.420
um,

1415
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.260
where we were still best of friends and realized him,

1416
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.161
you're John Wayne,

1417
00:36:42.161 --> 00:36:42.960
go get your horse gallop.

1418
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.181
Boy,

1419
00:36:43.181 --> 00:36:44.710
I'm going to go over here and get a bear.

1420
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:45.791
And A,

1421
00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:48.990
we made it or will you always live in like this?

1422
00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:49.501
Like what did,

1423
00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:50.334
what did,

1424
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.241
how would you meet?

1425
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:52.920
It might just be born in Chicago.

1426
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:54.501
And,

1427
00:36:54.501 --> 00:36:54.590
uh,

1428
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.900
at a very early age,

1429
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.590
um,

1430
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.230
my mom was leaving my dad and,

1431
00:36:59.231 --> 00:36:59.310
uh,

1432
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.160
back then divorced,

1433
00:37:00.161 --> 00:37:01.450
it wasn't very popular,

1434
00:37:01.451 --> 00:37:02.350
but she left him,

1435
00:37:02.351 --> 00:37:03.460
brought us up to Alaska,

1436
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.170
and then she left to go do her own thing.

1437
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.640
So,

1438
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.473
um,

1439
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.480
very quickly I had to get used to living in a tent hunting.

1440
00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.221
And,

1441
00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:15.400
uh,

1442
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.750
I finished school very early.

1443
00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:18.650
I graduated high school just before I turned 13.

1444
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.320
Dean,

1445
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.400
why'd you have to get used to living in a tent and hunting?

1446
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.370
I don't get into that part of my life very much so.

1447
00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.060
Um,

1448
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:25.893
because you know,

1449
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.160
I love my mother to death.

1450
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:29.320
I've never walked a mile in anybody's shoes,

1451
00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:30.310
let alone three feet.

1452
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.640
So what made her decide to go from Chicago to Alaska and then leave us and to

1453
00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:39.160
our own devices and go to something else?

1454
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.023
I don't know.

1455
00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.560
How old were you when this was going on?

1456
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.473
Yo.

1457
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.900
And um,

1458
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.120
but she's still alive.

1459
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:47.790
I've never held anything against during an all.

1460
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:48.461
And that's the thing.

1461
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:50.260
I mean when people,

1462
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.590
they hold grudges on other people or they let it affect their lives.

1463
00:37:53.591 --> 00:37:53.980
You know,

1464
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.940
how many people are in therapy?

1465
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:55.411
We signed one,

1466
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:55.981
oh it was turning.

1467
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:58.000
This happened while fuck is 40 years ago.

1468
00:37:58.001 --> 00:37:58.834
Get over it.

1469
00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.741
You know,

1470
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:01.480
I mean you have to move forward.

1471
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:03.730
If you have one foot in the past and one in the future,

1472
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.470
the only place you're not living is today.

1473
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.670
Some people wallow.

1474
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.220
They enjoy being upset.

1475
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.260
They'd be in a drama Queens Fon,

1476
00:38:11.261 --> 00:38:13.090
I suppose you know for some people.

1477
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:13.924
But you know,

1478
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.400
it's not my style.

1479
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.900
Obviously not

1480
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.670
<v 2>drama queens really wouldn't be back in Alaska after getting almost killed by a</v>

1481
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:24.504
bear.

1482
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:25.641
<v 1>Well you know,</v>

1483
00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:26.970
are you going to then be real?

1484
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.350
Is your life then going to be run by your fear?

1485
00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:30.920
And when,

1486
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.753
where does it stop?

1487
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.040
Fair is a desperate creature that grabs as much turf as it can get.

1488
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.100
So once you start letting it run your life,

1489
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.550
you better have a good [inaudible] bear sneakers cause you're going to be

1490
00:38:41.551 --> 00:38:42.570
running the rest of your life.

1491
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.860
That's an excellent description.

1492
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.641
There really is.

1493
00:38:44.641 --> 00:38:45.211
That's very,

1494
00:38:45.211 --> 00:38:46.044
very accurate.

1495
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.430
He looking for the nicotine again?

1496
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.151
Yeah,

1497
00:38:48.151 --> 00:38:48.984
I saw it.

1498
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.890
Do you anticipate living there for the rest of your life or would you be

1499
00:38:55.891 --> 00:39:00.891
interested in a similarly sort of isolated but different environment?

1500
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:02.730
Um,

1501
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:03.620
or do you have a personal,

1502
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.640
like I don't plan that far ahead.

1503
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.670
I currently am enjoying the hell out of the challenges and thriving with what

1504
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:13.234
I'm doing,

1505
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.000
but I have kind of a raven personality.

1506
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.720
There is going to be another shiny thing on the horizon and I'll be like

1507
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.393
checking it out.

1508
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.360
Um,

1509
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.500
a lot of people don't know,

1510
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:23.711
you know,

1511
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:25.510
I've traveled a lot in my life.

1512
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:30.040
I mean there are so many awesome things to see on the planet and I don't want to

1513
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.510
die be sitting there in the grave,

1514
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:33.130
my little soul lifting up and go,

1515
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:33.641
fuck,

1516
00:39:33.641 --> 00:39:34.660
I wish I would've done that.

1517
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.210
I want to be lifting it up saying God,

1518
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:38.530
it nailed it,

1519
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.873
you know?

1520
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:40.480
Um,

1521
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.640
so there will be other things that catch my eye.

1522
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.650
My Body is getting older.

1523
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:45.730
I've beat the hell out of it.

1524
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:49.480
I'm probably not going to stop doing that when I can no longer function at

1525
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:50.314
Kavach.

1526
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.480
And make it safe for people,

1527
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:54.160
then I don't have any business being there.

1528
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.953
Um,

1529
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.610
there's so much to see and do.

1530
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.140
And is that how you've always run it?

1531
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.240
You've rose running as sort of a bed and breakfast?

1532
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.720
Um,

1533
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.111
yeah.

1534
00:40:03.111 --> 00:40:03.431
The,

1535
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:05.330
the company that has that owned it before.

1536
00:40:05.331 --> 00:40:06.111
I know a,

1537
00:40:06.111 --> 00:40:06.411
you know,

1538
00:40:06.411 --> 00:40:07.370
the person that used to own it,

1539
00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:07.980
the company,

1540
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.270
um,

1541
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.220
they were friends of mine and they came looking for me.

1542
00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:13.520
I used to have a 400 mile trap line along the Jim River and had a bunch of sled

1543
00:40:13.521 --> 00:40:15.680
dogs and that's how I live for a long time.

1544
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.800
You go 400 miles up sending your trips or her miles down,

1545
00:40:18.801 --> 00:40:20.060
checking them all by herself.

1546
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:20.650
Yeah.

1547
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:21.483
And then I thought,

1548
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:21.890
you know,

1549
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:22.970
I did marry again,

1550
00:40:22.971 --> 00:40:25.630
that did not work out as well as I would've liked.

1551
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.553
Uh,

1552
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.340
but January another trapper.

1553
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:28.890
Ah,

1554
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:29.271
yeah,

1555
00:40:29.271 --> 00:40:32.390
he's somebody I knew when I was little and I ended up in Alaska.

1556
00:40:32.391 --> 00:40:35.630
He was gonna come up there and we used to joke around because he used to say,

1557
00:40:35.631 --> 00:40:36.800
I'm going to marry you.

1558
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.221
And I'm like,

1559
00:40:37.221 --> 00:40:37.431
yeah,

1560
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:38.330
I'm never getting married.

1561
00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:38.631
Sorry.

1562
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:39.464
Sucker,

1563
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.000
but on his way up,

1564
00:40:41.001 --> 00:40:42.440
he got to avalanches.

1565
00:40:42.441 --> 00:40:44.320
He turned around and married somebody else and I'm thinking,

1566
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:44.421
well,

1567
00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:45.680
a real man would have made it,

1568
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:48.523
but it ended up,

1569
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.910
it was not a good thing.

1570
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:50.330
Um,

1571
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.950
he went a little bushy up there in Kavach and yeah,

1572
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.950
where are you?

1573
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.150
You lose your perspective,

1574
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.431
you know?

1575
00:40:57.431 --> 00:40:58.264
Um,

1576
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.100
when you're all alone,

1577
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.360
there's no social,

1578
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.780
there's nobody saying,

1579
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.001
Ooh,

1580
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:06.850
you can't wear like in the winter I wear my long Johns and jammy pants as long

1581
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:08.230
Johns all winter long.

1582
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.760
I try to gain 20 to 30 pounds minimum to go into winter because when I get stuck

1583
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.070
at 50 below in a blizzard,

1584
00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:15.761
working hard,

1585
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:17.410
I'm going to lose pounds every day.

1586
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:19.210
I don't want to come out being unhealthy.

1587
00:41:19.211 --> 00:41:20.710
So I go in being a little junky.

1588
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:21.531
Wow,

1589
00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:22.341
that's interesting.

1590
00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:23.420
So it's a strategy.

1591
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.720
What do you eat to ensure that whatever.

1592
00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:29.370
I want to see a lot of cake and pie and you know,

1593
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.290
my body,

1594
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.610
if you listen to your body,

1595
00:41:31.611 --> 00:41:32.840
it's going to tell you what it wants.

1596
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.570
Even a pregnant woman when she's craving pickles and ice cream,

1597
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:37.340
she probably needs salt,

1598
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.301
potassium,

1599
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:39.134
and calcium.

1600
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.140
So you break down your craving into what,

1601
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.591
what,

1602
00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:42.320
what's in there.

1603
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:42.531
Oh,

1604
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:42.831
okay.

1605
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:44.240
And you can eat something else,

1606
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:45.890
but it's going to give your body what it needs.

1607
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.530
Your body can only remember where you last got it from.

1608
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.200
So what's going to throw all these wacky things together and say,

1609
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.960
eat chocolate bananas with raisins and uh,

1610
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.813
you know,

1611
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.730
some steak.

1612
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.230
So break it down.

1613
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:58.250
You need iron,

1614
00:41:58.251 --> 00:41:59.031
you need calcium,

1615
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:00.110
you need potassium,

1616
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.310
you know you need Niacin.

1617
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:02.150
So I'll go grab it.

1618
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.460
<v 2>Do you ever have any vegetarians try to stay up there with you?</v>

1619
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.100
<v 1>I do.</v>

1620
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.750
I cater to and you know,

1621
00:42:06.751 --> 00:42:07.650
I do Vegan,

1622
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.791
vegetarian.

1623
00:42:08.791 --> 00:42:09.470
Really?

1624
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.830
Yup.

1625
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.760
Gluten free diabetic,

1626
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.820
any nutrient diet other than there's some people,

1627
00:42:14.821 --> 00:42:18.090
there was only one group and I don't know what they call themselves,

1628
00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:18.924
but the,

1629
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.700
they all will only eat something.

1630
00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:21.990
An apple that fell to the ground.

1631
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.120
It has to commit aside or something.

1632
00:42:24.121 --> 00:42:24.571
And I'm like,

1633
00:42:24.571 --> 00:42:24.810
yeah,

1634
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:25.140
no,

1635
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.460
I can't do that one.

1636
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.000
<v 2>Oh My god,</v>

1637
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:30.140
people are so crazy.

1638
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:30.870
Um,

1639
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.530
it must be very difficult to get vegetables

1640
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.290
<v 1>there.</v>

1641
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.830
It is.

1642
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.560
I try to do a garden every year,

1643
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.450
but for me at my location,

1644
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.403
um,

1645
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.990
when I used to do the,

1646
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.501
Oh my God,

1647
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:43.550
I'm having a hard time putting her down.

1648
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.983
Um,

1649
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:46.130
this going,

1650
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.060
it's a type of plastic,

1651
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:48.380
but it has a very oily smell.

1652
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:49.970
Bears are attracted to oil.

1653
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.110
And so every time I'd make a visqueen greenhouse,

1654
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.250
it would start going good and then the bear comes up Mirrar and terrorists it

1655
00:42:56.251 --> 00:42:57.050
apart.

1656
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.681
So,

1657
00:42:57.681 --> 00:42:58.490
um,

1658
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.010
and my area is much,

1659
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:01.461
much,

1660
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.590
much more volatile with the weather.

1661
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.840
I will get snow and ice,

1662
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:06.140
uh,

1663
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.370
at least once a month.

1664
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.390
Um,

1665
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.320
this year I got my first big blizzard the end of the third week in August and it

1666
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:13.154
never went away.

1667
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.080
Don't care who migrated out.

1668
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:15.591
And that was it.

1669
00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:15.711
I,

1670
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:18.080
I froze up third week of August.

1671
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:18.470
Yeah,

1672
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.180
I have four or five feet of snow now.

1673
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:21.621
And you know,

1674
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:22.850
I've already dipped into the five,

1675
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:24.170
10 below zero range,

1676
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.490
probably 20 below zero.

1677
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:26.510
With wind chill factor,

1678
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.250
what's the lowest it ever gets up there?

1679
00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.280
My thermometer only goes to 100 below San.

1680
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:32.114
I peg it every year,

1681
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:33.741
you know,

1682
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:34.940
and that's the real temperature.

1683
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:37.100
You add some wind on top of it and it gets psycho.

1684
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.720
Oh my God.

1685
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.970
And then you'd start compiling that.

1686
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:45.860
You're in a tent with a thin piece of fabric.

1687
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:47.120
How do you keep that warm?

1688
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.390
Yeah.

1689
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:48.650
How do you keep that warrant?

1690
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.200
The,

1691
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.560
sometimes you're just going to have to put on the gear.

1692
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.270
There's been times where you know the wind is your biggest enemy.

1693
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:00.050
So as the winter goes on and you're building snow up the sides of the building,

1694
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:01.310
I know I try to let it get six,

1695
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:03.530
eight feet deep because that's a form of insulation.

1696
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.200
But where the wind hits your fabric,

1697
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:08.150
it's going to wick away the heat as quick as you can make it.

1698
00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:13.151
So I have bought battery operated fans to convect the air and then sometimes

1699
00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:15.590
you're just going to wear your winter gear for a week or two until the temps

1700
00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:16.270
come up.

1701
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.150
<v 2>Hundred below zero.</v>

1702
00:44:18.151 --> 00:44:19.170
That's incredible.

1703
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.520
I do this thing called cryotherapy where I step into this chamber.

1704
00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:26.100
It's 237 degrees below zero.

1705
00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.320
You do it naked is where your underwear,

1706
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.030
you stand in it for three minutes,

1707
00:44:30.031 --> 00:44:30.690
you get out,

1708
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:31.680
you back up,

1709
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:34.530
and then you go back in for another three minutes and it's a,

1710
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:34.950
it,

1711
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.950
it's improving your circulation and massive for anti inflammation for any

1712
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.490
injuries you might have.

1713
00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:44.610
It's incredible for like the healing properties and for soreness,

1714
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:46.050
like if you're sore from working out,

1715
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:48.930
just like straightens all that shit out right away.

1716
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.770
Yeah.

1717
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.030
But I keep,

1718
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:54.010
but that's just three minutes not sleeping.

1719
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:54.881
<v 1>You know,</v>

1720
00:44:54.881 --> 00:44:55.870
the equipment that I have,

1721
00:44:55.871 --> 00:44:57.450
I have a mile and a half long runway.

1722
00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.140
If somebody wants to land in the winter,

1723
00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.060
I've got to get out and work that runway.

1724
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:01.421
Yeah.

1725
00:45:01.421 --> 00:45:02.254
How do you do that?

1726
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.400
I have a bobcat.

1727
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.263
I don't,

1728
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.990
I'm not the proud owner of a piece of equipment that's all enclosed and heated.

1729
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.530
Um,

1730
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.350
whatever it is outside is what I'm experiencing.

1731
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.550
So like for me to even get out on my two to three hour window,

1732
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.870
I had to go out there,

1733
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.853
clear it,

1734
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.020
and then sit there for an hour and a half until boom,

1735
00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:24.370
the plane landed and a so Irmi my dog and I jumped in the plane and left.

1736
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.803
Wow.

1737
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.080
<v 2>A hundred below zero in a bobcat.</v>

1738
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.330
What the fuck is that?

1739
00:45:29.331 --> 00:45:30.164
Like

1740
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.460
<v 1>it's not good.</v>

1741
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.780
Your face is exposed or you where you're mowing.

1742
00:45:35.781 --> 00:45:36.141
Yeah,

1743
00:45:36.141 --> 00:45:37.820
you're covering as much as you can.

1744
00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.150
Um,

1745
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.890
I'm not the biggest fan of polypro.

1746
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.990
It's in the end,

1747
00:45:40.991 --> 00:45:43.100
a plastic product and uh,

1748
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.511
it will,

1749
00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:47.750
it's at a certain temperature instead of keeping you warm,

1750
00:45:47.751 --> 00:45:50.630
it's going to turn hard and then it's going to conduct the cold.

1751
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.400
So I'm not a big fan of polypro.

1752
00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:57.401
I like natural materials for it depends on what the temperatures are.

1753
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.860
Um,

1754
00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.330
I do have two for outfits,

1755
00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.081
one with the,

1756
00:46:00.081 --> 00:46:01.280
for facing in one with the,

1757
00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:05.420
for facing out at those temperatures are gonna wear both and you get out there

1758
00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:06.920
and you just get your work.

1759
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.140
<v 2>No,</v>

1760
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.190
the first facing in,

1761
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:08.401
in the,

1762
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:08.971
for facing.

1763
00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:11.010
And so you have like several layers of for yeah,

1764
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:11.451
yeah.

1765
00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:13.680
I make these yourself out of bear or,

1766
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.450
<v 1>um,</v>

1767
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.000
usually Caribou.

1768
00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:17.043
Um,

1769
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.310
and so,

1770
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:18.670
uh,

1771
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.060
and if you go back to the very first episode when the oil and everything got

1772
00:46:22.061 --> 00:46:22.710
stolen,

1773
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:23.110
um,

1774
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.700
a lot of my things got taken to,

1775
00:46:24.701 --> 00:46:27.190
so I am in the process of making new outfits.

1776
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.540
Who stole your oil?

1777
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.730
I'm not going to get into that,

1778
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.301
but you know,

1779
00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:34.840
a person that I did find out who did it and um,

1780
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.340
for me,

1781
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:37.510
the legal battle,

1782
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:38.403
you know,

1783
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:39.191
so sure.

1784
00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:40.240
I go out and I sit down when I say,

1785
00:46:40.241 --> 00:46:40.391
Hey,

1786
00:46:40.391 --> 00:46:41.890
you took this amount of money and fuel.

1787
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.251
Well,

1788
00:46:42.251 --> 00:46:46.630
they have more money than I do as a company and they're going to be able to stay

1789
00:46:46.631 --> 00:46:47.980
on the battle longer than I can.

1790
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.070
So I'm going to spend four times as much to get back a little bit of money.

1791
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.020
Well,

1792
00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.560
the north slope is a place that even if we don't live anywhere close to each

1793
00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:56.831
other,

1794
00:46:56.831 --> 00:46:58.480
word spreads like wildfire.

1795
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.850
That company has having a hard time even getting business now because they stole

1796
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.693
from you.

1797
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.390
Good.

1798
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.750
When you,

1799
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:05.830
when you lose,

1800
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.731
you know,

1801
00:47:06.731 --> 00:47:09.700
respect is something that is absolutely earned up there,

1802
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.380
but it's lost so easily

1803
00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.330
<v 2>do that.</v>

1804
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.450
And why would they steal oil from you like that?

1805
00:47:14.451 --> 00:47:17.150
Just because it was there and they could get away with it.

1806
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.331
<v 1>They thought they could.</v>

1807
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:18.661
Yeah.

1808
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:19.494
And they did,

1809
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.221
but you know,

1810
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:20.791
and they had,

1811
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:21.120
um,

1812
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.340
it,

1813
00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.550
it people use,

1814
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.340
now the camp is mostly ecotourism and ology.

1815
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.090
That's a majority of the money that comes through birdwatchers northern lights

1816
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:31.661
of yours.

1817
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:33.400
Scientists trying to get their groove on.

1818
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:34.563
But um,

1819
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.370
August and part of September,

1820
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.540
that's when the hunter show up.

1821
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.530
And when I had to leave to have my surgeries shut down the camp,

1822
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.210
this company thought,

1823
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:43.361
hey,

1824
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.160
this is a great way I can bring people in.

1825
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.760
I don't have to pay for anything and they're going to be warm and they're going

1826
00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:48.820
to use the equipment.

1827
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.713
And uh,

1828
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.080
but I did find a bill of lading that they left behind.

1829
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.670
They threw away their garbage.

1830
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.870
They did not burn their garbage.

1831
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.780
<v 3>So I went through the garbage.</v>

1832
00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.480
<v 1>So,</v>

1833
00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.500
but in the end,

1834
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.730
what is it worth?

1835
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.080
How long were they up there for?

1836
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.030
I would say they ran people through for a solid month.

1837
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.260
Wow.

1838
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.010
Yeah.

1839
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:11.240
But you know,

1840
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:11.990
the,

1841
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.340
the point is for me,

1842
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.710
what a bunch of fucking shit heads a choice.

1843
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:19.850
Do I choose to live and the negativity of that and drag myself through several

1844
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.940
years of court over it or do I just go right beyond it?

1845
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:23.570
Right.

1846
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:23.900
You know,

1847
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.670
they have to live with being a dickhead.

1848
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.810
I've moved past it.

1849
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.120
So you say August and September,

1850
00:48:29.121 --> 00:48:33.080
you have hunters up there and your camp [inaudible] and is it because of the

1851
00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:34.130
Caribou migration?

1852
00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:34.580
Yeah,

1853
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.010
three of the major herds migrate right through camp.

1854
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.430
Uh,

1855
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.200
the Catholic river valley is,

1856
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.210
if you go into the different,

1857
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:42.044
um,

1858
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.370
geologic papers,

1859
00:48:43.371 --> 00:48:44.480
professional papers,

1860
00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:48.980
even in the late 18 hundreds through the mid 19 hundreds,

1861
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.843
um,

1862
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.910
the Cavett river valley is very unique among the watersheds there.

1863
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.570
My variety of plant life is far different than it is another ones.

1864
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:57.350
Well,

1865
00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:57.960
the,

1866
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.350
the type of liken that to Carroll etes and moss,

1867
00:49:00.351 --> 00:49:04.910
if they eat to gain the most fat for their journey out is right in that valley

1868
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.040
places white stuff.

1869
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.491
I've seen.

1870
00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:07.810
Yeah.

1871
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.080
I mean this multicolored,

1872
00:49:09.081 --> 00:49:09.620
but yeah,

1873
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.060
they eat Lichen and moss.

1874
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.750
Right.

1875
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.580
And that's where they gain their fat.

1876
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.730
Well I have a high concentration of it in that valley,

1877
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:21.731
so they want to migrate through no guarantees implied because like this year

1878
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.840
they just lifted their collective cow heads and moved out and a really unusual

1879
00:49:26.841 --> 00:49:27.674
that they did.

1880
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.150
Now looking back at it winter hit with an iron fist and hasn't left yet.

1881
00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.430
So it was a smooth move.

1882
00:49:34.431 --> 00:49:36.470
Somehow they knew what was coming and they left.

1883
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.280
But yeah,

1884
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.110
go figure that one.

1885
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:39.741
But I do,

1886
00:49:39.741 --> 00:49:43.250
I pay attention to my plants sometime in August I start peeling the bark off the

1887
00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:44.570
willow if it's,

1888
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:44.770
you know,

1889
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.800
if it's easy to peel,

1890
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.040
the plants still thinks there's going to be plenty of good,

1891
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:48.380
uh,

1892
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.000
good weather once it starts really get tough and it's sucking up to the skin

1893
00:49:53.001 --> 00:49:55.970
while all the SAP is being reserved in that plant's getting ready for winter.

1894
00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.980
It may be 80 degrees outside,

1895
00:49:57.981 --> 00:50:00.260
but the plant is telling me to get the hell ready.

1896
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.460
So,

1897
00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:01.761
you know,

1898
00:50:01.761 --> 00:50:03.080
meteorologically speaking,

1899
00:50:03.081 --> 00:50:05.900
I can get on the Internet and look at the weather systems and say,

1900
00:50:05.901 --> 00:50:06.111
oh,

1901
00:50:06.111 --> 00:50:07.220
I think this was gonna happen.

1902
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.700
But I go outside and look at my plans and my animals and I know what's going to

1903
00:50:10.701 --> 00:50:11.534
happen.

1904
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.610
<v 3>That's amazing.</v>

1905
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.210
So you could tell by just pulling the bark off of,

1906
00:50:16.211 --> 00:50:17.260
off of a plant.

1907
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.750
That's right.

1908
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:22.750
<v 1>That tells me that those plants are getting ready for whether that I may not be</v>

1909
00:50:23.841 --> 00:50:24.680
thinking is coming,

1910
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:25.500
but they do.

1911
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.520
<v 3>That's amazing.</v>

1912
00:50:26.521 --> 00:50:27.800
How the fuck they know.

1913
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.933
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

1914
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.710
Wiley and dollar question.

1915
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.401
They know.

1916
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:32.270
And the Caribou,

1917
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:33.104
no,

1918
00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.750
<v 1>everything knows all of the sudden like there was one year and all the bears</v>

1919
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.660
rather than like they,

1920
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:42.450
they'll dig their dens into the side of the bank and when the water starts to

1921
00:50:42.451 --> 00:50:42.781
rise,

1922
00:50:42.781 --> 00:50:46.410
it comes in and wakes him up in a bear's favorite food is cub.

1923
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.850
So the Boers wake up,

1924
00:50:47.851 --> 00:50:51.330
the male bears usually first and they run around finding other dens and eat the

1925
00:50:51.331 --> 00:50:51.870
cubs.

1926
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:52.240
Yeah.

1927
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.073
Um,

1928
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.150
but then one year,

1929
00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.270
all of a sudden the bears came up and about 3000 foot level,

1930
00:50:57.271 --> 00:51:00.360
2000 foot level started digging dens and I'm like,

1931
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.100
I called a fish and game and I'm like,

1932
00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:02.431
wow,

1933
00:51:02.431 --> 00:51:03.510
what the hell is up with that?

1934
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:04.111
You know,

1935
00:51:04.111 --> 00:51:05.490
and nobody's ever there but me.

1936
00:51:05.491 --> 00:51:06.001
So I'm like,

1937
00:51:06.001 --> 00:51:06.181
dude,

1938
00:51:06.181 --> 00:51:06.340
I,

1939
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.100
I see this going on and what's happening?

1940
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.061
And they said,

1941
00:51:09.061 --> 00:51:09.511
I don't know,

1942
00:51:09.511 --> 00:51:11.250
but all the bears and the ones that are collared,

1943
00:51:11.251 --> 00:51:12.150
they're all moving up.

1944
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:13.200
And I was like,

1945
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.830
Oh shit.

1946
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:17.010
So I tried to get everything set up in camp because that usually means an

1947
00:51:17.011 --> 00:51:18.900
excessively high amount of snow,

1948
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:22.260
which means an excessive amount of water and flooding in the spring.

1949
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.590
So I tried to get everything ready by watching what they're doing.

1950
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.280
I can set camp up differently to be protected from a flood in the spring.

1951
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.980
<v 2>That is amazing.</v>

1952
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.340
That is so amazing that they know that an excessive amount of snow is coming.

1953
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.970
<v 1>How they figure it,</v>

1954
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:38.804
who knows?

1955
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.590
But they,

1956
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.620
they will adjust and readjust their actions,

1957
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:43.820
you know,

1958
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.470
based on something that they feel.

1959
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.740
Why can adjust what I do based on what I see.

1960
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.660
<v 2>That's so bizarre.</v>

1961
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.400
I want to go up there now.

1962
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.270
We'll get up there.

1963
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.081
I want to go up there.

1964
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:57.110
I want to come up there and hunt Caribou up there in August,

1965
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:57.860
September.

1966
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.693
That's the time.

1967
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.810
<v 1>What I tell people,</v>

1968
00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:02.640
I mean I cannot guide without a license,

1969
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.250
but um,

1970
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:05.340
I can,

1971
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.810
I can look at trends sometime between August in the middle of September.

1972
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.340
That's when they're going to be there.

1973
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:15.540
Now it opens up in July or hunting season goes from July through July.

1974
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.861
But you know,

1975
00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:19.650
for so many months out of the year they're down south having a vacation in

1976
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:19.950
[inaudible].

1977
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:20.100
<v 2>Right.</v>

1978
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.240
So you have a 12 month hunting.

1979
00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:22.590
See it's just open all year round.

1980
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:23.790
<v 1>Pretty much the,</v>

1981
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:23.981
uh,

1982
00:52:23.981 --> 00:52:28.981
the animals depending on the species are our hunting season starts in July of

1983
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.600
any year and then goes through the winter.

1984
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.040
And depending on the species,

1985
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:36.760
you have to give shutdown the season so that the animals can give birth and

1986
00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:37.660
raise new babies.

1987
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:39.370
They have to have a safety zone,

1988
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.680
but in July it opens up again.

1989
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.120
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1990
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.370
So when you shoot these bears,

1991
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.360
like when a bear comes in,

1992
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:47.660
do you,

1993
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.680
are you eating these things?

1994
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:50.900
Yeah.

1995
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.780
Spring bear is always,

1996
00:52:51.781 --> 00:52:52.100
yeah.

1997
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.933
<v 1>Then fall bear,</v>

1998
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.780
um,

1999
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.210
the Gamey taste if you will,

2000
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.100
is more concentrated in the fat.

2001
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.450
A brown bear from down south is eating a lot of fish diet and you are what you

2002
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:03.140
eat.

2003
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.000
So it's a very fishy tasting product.

2004
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:05.960
I don't care for that.

2005
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.120
Um,

2006
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.000
bought up by me.

2007
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:11.000
I like to tell people that the bears eat berries and slow tourists,

2008
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:11.893
so I'm cool,

2009
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.710
you know?

2010
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.101
But yeah,

2011
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:14.120
the bear that I got,

2012
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.890
um,

2013
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:16.790
what you don't see in that episode is,

2014
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:17.061
you know,

2015
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:17.381
I,

2016
00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:18.111
I shoot the bear,

2017
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:18.950
I make sure he's gone.

2018
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:19.230
It was a,

2019
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:20.330
it was an emotional thing,

2020
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.550
but I start skinning him and I start getting the meat.

2021
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:24.350
I got about 300 pounds of meat off of a mall.

2022
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.350
Here's another bear,

2023
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:28.890
another grizzly start circling in and getting real tight.

2024
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:30.330
So we had the four wheelers,

2025
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:32.150
I brought him up and the boom,

2026
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.090
the fog came down.

2027
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:34.110
It went totally dark.

2028
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.940
And so now you can't see.

2029
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:40.640
So the safety dude for the films was there with his weapon and a,

2030
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.950
we put the headlights all out and you'd see this bear come in and sideswiped the

2031
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:44.784
four wheelers.

2032
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.250
Well after 300 pounds of meat and getting,

2033
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.113
you know,

2034
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.590
harvesting the for,

2035
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.480
I just had to say,

2036
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.900
it's time for me to back off the bear can munch on this,

2037
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:55.820
which will buy me the time.

2038
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:56.530
<v 2>Get away.</v>

2039
00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:57.460
It's where the bears are.

2040
00:53:57.461 --> 00:53:59.830
Such cannibals opportunists.

2041
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:00.390
Yeah.

2042
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.520
<v 1>Oh,</v>

2043
00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.580
I'm sure they don't look and say,

2044
00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:02.031
Oh wow,

2045
00:54:02.031 --> 00:54:02.840
that was Marty.

2046
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.351
You know,

2047
00:54:03.351 --> 00:54:08.180
it's just an opportunity to fill their beaks and it's survival at its basic.

2048
00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.370
The cub thing though was really creepy.

2049
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:11.570
It is.

2050
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:12.051
It is.

2051
00:54:12.051 --> 00:54:12.590
Um,

2052
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:13.730
I don't know.

2053
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.860
I don't know what started that with bears,

2054
00:54:15.861 --> 00:54:16.191
but,

2055
00:54:16.191 --> 00:54:16.430
uh,

2056
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.731
I mean,

2057
00:54:16.731 --> 00:54:20.900
it's a sure bet in an area where the Caribou may not have migrated out early

2058
00:54:20.901 --> 00:54:22.370
enough and when the bears wake up,

2059
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.450
they're fairly sluggish.

2060
00:54:23.451 --> 00:54:24.710
They walk around like drunkards.

2061
00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:27.890
Their muscles are atrophied and there's not a lot of food,

2062
00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.240
but it's a sure bet that the mothers with cubs tend to wake up later.

2063
00:54:32.241 --> 00:54:33.200
So they just go in,

2064
00:54:33.201 --> 00:54:33.680
dig it out.

2065
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.820
And it's an opportunity for food still

2066
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.411
<v 2>so,</v>

2067
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:42.411
so crazy that an animal would almost instinctively and naturally cannibalize

2068
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:44.470
<v 1>it is,</v>

2069
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.811
you know,

2070
00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:46.700
I mean from a human's perspective it's,

2071
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:46.940
it's,

2072
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:47.930
it's a little creepy,

2073
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.300
but from an animal perspective,

2074
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.650
if you want to survive,

2075
00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:53.150
you're going to find what foods are available.

2076
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:53.920
<v 2>Mm.</v>

2077
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.180
But it seems like they're one of the rare animals that cannibalizes on a regular

2078
00:54:58.181 --> 00:54:59.014
basis.

2079
00:54:59.020 --> 00:54:59.561
Like that is,

2080
00:54:59.561 --> 00:55:00.640
that's a stakeholder.

2081
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.700
If you've ever had a kid that had a dribble as a pet.

2082
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.301
Oh,

2083
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.080
that's true.

2084
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.411
Yeah,

2085
00:55:05.411 --> 00:55:05.771
that's true.

2086
00:55:05.771 --> 00:55:08.530
I actually had hamsters and then they ate two babies.

2087
00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.480
We had a watch it and we're like,

2088
00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:11.150
what the fuck?

2089
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.983
But they,

2090
00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.490
they had a disease though called wet tail that something to some disease at

2091
00:55:15.491 --> 00:55:17.530
hamsters get when the babies get a disease,

2092
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:18.550
the mother will eat the baby.

2093
00:55:18.551 --> 00:55:19.331
But you know,

2094
00:55:19.331 --> 00:55:23.530
our cute little hamster that we love was just challen on its baby's head.

2095
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.370
And I,

2096
00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.140
it was like an open coconut and I was like,

2097
00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:28.210
what the fuck is wrong with fluffy?

2098
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:33.100
Jesus Christ was bloody mass inside the hamster cage.

2099
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.020
But I think that was more,

2100
00:55:35.021 --> 00:55:35.854
like I said,

2101
00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:36.531
because the,

2102
00:55:36.531 --> 00:55:36.710
the,

2103
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.543
they were sick.

2104
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.040
It wasn't like she was really hungry.

2105
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:40.480
She had played a hamster food.

2106
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:40.960
Yeah.

2107
00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.793
I don't know.

2108
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.491
I don't know either.

2109
00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:43.324
I'm just guessing.

2110
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:44.240
But it's just,

2111
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.240
it's one of the weird things about bears like bears particularly that they will,

2112
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.640
they will survive at any cost.

2113
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:53.260
And they actually,

2114
00:55:53.261 --> 00:55:53.801
as you said,

2115
00:55:53.801 --> 00:55:57.810
they actually go out looking for the cubs as one of the things that sound

2116
00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:58.461
<v 1>got early.</v>

2117
00:55:58.461 --> 00:56:00.560
And Marty actually the bear that I mentioned earlier,

2118
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:05.200
she is old enough that she acts a lot like a bore a bar as a male bear and a

2119
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:07.970
silo as a female and a old as she is.

2120
00:56:07.971 --> 00:56:08.804
She has,

2121
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:11.630
she digs her downs where she's going to get hit with the water to wake her up

2122
00:56:11.631 --> 00:56:13.340
first and she'll do the same thing.

2123
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:14.101
<v 2>Wow.</v>

2124
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:15.480
She'll go out looking for cubs.

2125
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.900
Yup.

2126
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.010
Whoa.

2127
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:18.780
Jesus.

2128
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.400
When I was in Alberta,

2129
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:20.911
the,

2130
00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:21.061
uh,

2131
00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:22.350
the camp that I was at,

2132
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.920
the guy who was there,

2133
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:24.100
this

2134
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.933
<v 3>Guy John,</v>

2135
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.953
his son,

2136
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.600
saw a bear,

2137
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:29.830
killed the cub,

2138
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:30.640
kill this,

2139
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.960
attack this female,

2140
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.010
kill the cub,

2141
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.113
and then,

2142
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.540
uh,

2143
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:39.070
ate half of it left and the female came back and ate the rest of her cub.

2144
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.610
Yeah.

2145
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:40.121
And he was like,

2146
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:40.361
wow,

2147
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:41.111
that's a first.

2148
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:43.000
I've never seen one eat their own cub,

2149
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.760
but I guess wanted,

2150
00:56:44.761 --> 00:56:45.340
it's dead.

2151
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.600
It just becomes me.

2152
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.200
Ooh.

2153
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.033
Yeah.

2154
00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.830
We watched these bears go at it too.

2155
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:55.090
It was crazy watching these like ultimate fighting championship of bears.

2156
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.570
They just started going to battle because the mail kept trying to come into camp

2157
00:56:58.571 --> 00:56:59.590
and the female was send her,

2158
00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:03.100
bear her cubs up the tree and try to chase off the mail.

2159
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:06.730
And he would deal with it for a little bit and they would come back in and then

2160
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:07.170
they would start,

2161
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:10.290
started fighting and they were standing on two legs and going at it.

2162
00:57:10.291 --> 00:57:10.380
Yeah.

2163
00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.690
<v 1>It's amazing to see.</v>

2164
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.120
Even the wolves or the Wolverines,

2165
00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:15.621
no.

2166
00:57:15.621 --> 00:57:15.900
You know,

2167
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.690
I'm going to have seen a wolverine now and when I say Wolverine,

2168
00:57:18.691 --> 00:57:18.861
yeah,

2169
00:57:18.861 --> 00:57:19.540
they're a,

2170
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.520
they're like a badger.

2171
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.170
Mine are about three and a half,

2172
00:57:22.171 --> 00:57:23.160
four foot at the shoulders,

2173
00:57:23.161 --> 00:57:24.150
120 pounds.

2174
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.090
But I've seen them take on grizzlies and come out on top.

2175
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:31.260
That's a big [inaudible] right as some of the wolverines up by me and even the

2176
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.103
wolves,

2177
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.480
they're considered to have the,

2178
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:37.740
they call it a throwback to the Mackenzie river breed and they're averaging

2179
00:57:37.741 --> 00:57:38.461
about 200,

2180
00:57:38.461 --> 00:57:39.510
250 pounds.

2181
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:40.201
The wolves.

2182
00:57:40.201 --> 00:57:40.530
Yeah.

2183
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.760
I used to have state record for the state of Alaska on a trapped wolf.

2184
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:44.130
Uh,

2185
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:44.791
it was nine foot,

2186
00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:45.361
six inches,

2187
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:45.991
nose to tail.

2188
00:57:45.991 --> 00:57:46.980
And I had it in Calvic,

2189
00:57:46.981 --> 00:57:47.530
you know,

2190
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.930
a dining home foot,

2191
00:57:48.931 --> 00:57:49.980
six inches.

2192
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.870
Wolves I'm dealing with are not these little tiny Shitzu things,

2193
00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:55.501
you know,

2194
00:57:55.501 --> 00:57:57.420
they are shit sue.

2195
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.501
<v 3>Wow,</v>

2196
00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:02.670
that's crazy.

2197
00:58:02.671 --> 00:58:07.200
And you get in like a pack of 20 plus that are that are actually taking out a

2198
00:58:07.201 --> 00:58:07.560
bear.

2199
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:07.790
Yeah.

2200
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:09.500
<v 1>Usually a wolf.</v>

2201
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:14.530
Will they adjust their pack size according to how much food there is an

2202
00:58:15.381 --> 00:58:15.951
opportunity.

2203
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:16.730
There is,

2204
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:19.730
well there is enough by me that they've actually,

2205
00:58:19.731 --> 00:58:20.870
they never split the pack.

2206
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:21.671
They are still an,

2207
00:58:21.671 --> 00:58:25.490
I used to say 21 and then the people that do the air censuses,

2208
00:58:25.491 --> 00:58:25.731
you know,

2209
00:58:25.731 --> 00:58:26.660
he called in and he says,

2210
00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:27.140
hey sue,

2211
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.973
it's sandy here.

2212
00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:28.731
You know you always,

2213
00:58:28.731 --> 00:58:30.440
you always say 21 wolves and I'm like,

2214
00:58:30.441 --> 00:58:30.801
yeah,

2215
00:58:30.801 --> 00:58:33.380
so what is it 18 it looks like 21 to me and he says no,

2216
00:58:33.381 --> 00:58:35.510
22 plus pups and I'm like,

2217
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.380
Ooh nieces.

2218
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:36.651
Yeah,

2219
00:58:36.651 --> 00:58:38.780
they've actually dug a permanent den now,

2220
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.190
which is unusual.

2221
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.780
They follow their food source.

2222
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:47.020
So to dig a permanent den shows me that my ecosystem is changing enough that the

2223
00:58:48.651 --> 00:58:49.670
wolf's feel they need,

2224
00:58:49.671 --> 00:58:51.530
they can stake a territory and stay there.

2225
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:52.220
Wow.

2226
00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.780
It's not just everything migrates out,

2227
00:58:53.781 --> 00:58:54.321
you follow it,

2228
00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:54.990
it comes back in,

2229
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.823
you follow it.

2230
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.810
They feel that there is now a good enough food source that they can stay year

2231
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:00.340
round and one yeah

2232
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:00.880
<v 3>place.</v>

2233
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.300
Besides the time where they chase the bear and the bear brushed up against the

2234
00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:05.290
tents and you know,

2235
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:06.163
they took 'em out.

2236
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:07.960
How close do they get to you?

2237
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.843
<v 1>Pretty close.</v>

2238
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.773
Um,

2239
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.400
back when I first started at Calvic,

2240
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:12.880
you know,

2241
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.330
uh,

2242
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:14.290
it was set up differently,

2243
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:15.071
different buildings,

2244
00:59:15.071 --> 00:59:15.904
everything,

2245
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:19.030
but the desk was in the dining hall.

2246
00:59:19.031 --> 00:59:20.530
I used to live in a corner of the dining hall.

2247
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:25.160
And so you have a window out here on the wooden end cap and I'm doing the stuff

2248
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.210
for work.

2249
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.630
And he had just had a feeling something was behind you and I turn around and I'm

2250
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:31.580
nose to nose with the big black wolf has had,

2251
00:59:31.581 --> 00:59:32.780
was stuffed right through the window.

2252
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.860
So I go to reach the gun and he just slipped down and ran.

2253
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.190
So he kind of had a feeling that you were going to shoot him?

2254
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:41.470
Um,

2255
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:42.080
or new?

2256
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.400
He just needed to get the hell out.

2257
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:44.234
Yeah.

2258
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.960
Yeah.

2259
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.321
I was,

2260
00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:45.530
uh,

2261
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.870
I was doing a shady moves so he needed to get out,

2262
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:51.440
but I don't know how long he was back there and he certainly could have chewed

2263
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:51.891
me up,

2264
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:54.410
but he was as curious about me as I was about him.

2265
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.930
And it seems like if they're making a Dan and having cut,

2266
00:59:57.931 --> 00:59:59.990
they probably have a steady supply of food.

2267
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.920
Yeah,

2268
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.701
feral now,

2269
01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:02.031
you know,

2270
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.470
am I on that food group?

2271
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.333
Probably.

2272
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.630
Do they normally go?

2273
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.021
Oh yeah,

2274
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:07.970
let's find a city and start attacking people.

2275
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:08.450
No,

2276
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.470
but I'm not a city.

2277
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:10.304
I'm an individual.

2278
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.540
So,

2279
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:11.780
um,

2280
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.890
but like when my granddaughter,

2281
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:15.290
when she first came up there to visit and she was six,

2282
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:19.070
five or six and every time she got more than 10 foot away here out of the river

2283
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:19.281
bank,

2284
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:20.660
the big gray wolf would starts Lincoln.

2285
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.470
So I had to tie a rope from her to me and she couldn't get more than 10 foot

2286
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:26.360
away and which frustrated her.

2287
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:30.500
So I took her for a walk down to the Old Fox den where the little babies were

2288
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.550
and all of the little bodies are there and bones are there and,

2289
01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:35.150
and the wolf had gotten in and eaten them.

2290
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.020
And uh,

2291
01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.150
she was all bummed out and I turned around to walk.

2292
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:40.760
Now we had not even two minutes there.

2293
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.970
And here's a wolf track about this big and I have a picture of her hand next to

2294
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:45.230
it and it was right in her footprint.

2295
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:46.160
And I said,

2296
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.521
okay.

2297
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:46.971
And she says,

2298
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.230
he is stalking me.

2299
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.191
And then I said,

2300
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:50.000
yeah,

2301
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.990
so what does that tell you?

2302
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:51.201
I said,

2303
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:52.100
where is he right now?

2304
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:54.530
And then her eyes got big and all she sees his brush and I said,

2305
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:54.651
yeah,

2306
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:55.760
we need to get the hell out of here.

2307
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.910
You are a Scooby snack and you're carrying a gun the entire time.

2308
01:00:59.060 --> 01:00:59.570
Oh yeah.

2309
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:00.050
Yeah.

2310
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.130
You don't go anywhere without a gun?

2311
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.550
Nope.

2312
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:02.750
And when the kids get up there,

2313
01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:03.111
you know,

2314
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:03.301
I,

2315
01:01:03.301 --> 01:01:04.970
I teach them with little weapons first.

2316
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:05.241
You know,

2317
01:01:05.241 --> 01:01:10.070
they get a four 10 shotgun and a 22 single action and they learn gun safety.

2318
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.900
And then like my grandson this year,

2319
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:15.320
he came up and for the first time he got to take down a couple of Caribou and

2320
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:16.154
feed his family.

2321
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.611
You know,

2322
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:18.980
I helped him prepare the meat and he took it back down south.

2323
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.140
So my granddaughter though,

2324
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.441
you know,

2325
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:22.640
that's the difference in,

2326
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:23.000
um,

2327
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.470
I have to celebrate who she is,

2328
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:26.240
not who I am when I'm with her.

2329
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.280
And after her first year there,

2330
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:28.581
you know,

2331
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:30.020
I ask her is I was bringing her home,

2332
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.030
um,

2333
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.460
and I said,

2334
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:31.641
Oh,

2335
01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:32.600
you're gonna come up and visit,

2336
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.990
you know,

2337
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.441
Nathan,

2338
01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:34.101
my grandson,

2339
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:35.660
he's all boo ya about coming back.

2340
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.561
And I said,

2341
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:38.270
so do you want to come back up and see grandma?

2342
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:38.931
And she said,

2343
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:39.651
well grandma,

2344
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:39.951
you know,

2345
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:40.581
I love you,

2346
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:41.414
right?

2347
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.200
And I'm like,

2348
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.861
yeah.

2349
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:43.431
And she says,

2350
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:46.700
but I'm going to go visit uncle Jesse and amp Megan cause they do Manny Petty's

2351
01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:47.780
and they like to shop

2352
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.660
for her.

2353
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.200
She's,

2354
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.430
she's a girly girl.

2355
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:53.301
Anything sparkly,

2356
01:01:53.301 --> 01:01:55.310
shiny and pink is on her hit list.

2357
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.121
So,

2358
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:56.301
uh,

2359
01:01:56.301 --> 01:01:56.811
I told her,

2360
01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:57.051
I said,

2361
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:57.231
well,

2362
01:01:57.231 --> 01:01:57.501
okay,

2363
01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:58.880
you can't bomb out at your,

2364
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.350
your brother when he gets to come up.

2365
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.070
But uh,

2366
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:02.180
when I do take a break,

2367
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:02.631
I'll,

2368
01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:03.351
I'll hook you up,

2369
01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:05.490
we'll go to Laughlin and uh,

2370
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:10.400
we'll go get big ass sunglasses during virgin my ties and go shopping for

2371
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:11.570
dresses and get many Petty's.

2372
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.210
So I have to celebrate who she is,

2373
01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:16.720
not necessarily who I am or who I think she should.

2374
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:18.260
Good for yourself.

2375
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.070
Now you live in a place that doesn't

2376
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.060
<v 3>have any trees.</v>

2377
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:22.300
Why?

2378
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:22.891
Why is that?

2379
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:23.724
Just because

2380
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.750
<v 1>above the tree line,</v>

2381
01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.301
<v 3>is it the,</v>

2382
01:02:25.301 --> 01:02:27.350
is that because it's just gets too cold?

2383
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:28.230
The weather is too harsh.

2384
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:28.661
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:29.980
I don't have soil.

2386
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.000
There is no soil.

2387
01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:33.580
You have ice permanently frozen ground.

2388
01:02:33.581 --> 01:02:35.080
You have rocks on top of that.

2389
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:36.390
Maybe a little silt.

2390
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.680
But that's a round rock cell does around rock.

2391
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:39.910
It's not soil.

2392
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.880
And so it's very difficult for things to grow.

2393
01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.340
And with the growing season in the cold temperatures,

2394
01:02:45.341 --> 01:02:46.630
things grow very slowly.

2395
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.010
So it's just a,

2396
01:02:48.011 --> 01:02:49.900
it's not a climate that trees can grow in.

2397
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.680
<v 3>So this is an incredibly inhospitable environment to a lot of animals.</v>

2398
01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.600
So why do animals live up there?

2399
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:59.320
Like what?

2400
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.970
What keeps them coming back?

2401
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:03.450
<v 1>No matter where you are on the planet,</v>

2402
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.970
whether it be a form of bacteria,

2403
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.350
look at an asteroid,

2404
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.910
you've got bacteria and viruses,

2405
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:09.744
a grill.

2406
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:10.763
Why?

2407
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.461
Who knows?

2408
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:12.420
Life finds a way.

2409
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:14.293
<v 3>Wow.</v>

2410
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.080
And life finds a way 200 miles above the arctic circle.

2411
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:20.181
I just,

2412
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:20.660
I mean it's,

2413
01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.800
I have a hard time.

2414
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.900
I just don't understand what compels you to choose that isolation when you can

2415
01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:31.901
choose an isolation more like in an area where you maybe have more trees and you

2416
01:03:32.991 --> 01:03:33.171
know,

2417
01:03:33.171 --> 01:03:33.580
you can,

2418
01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.290
<v 1>that may be one of my next steps.</v>

2419
01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.460
I mean when I want a softer,

2420
01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:37.480
easier way of life,

2421
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:38.080
I'll go downwards.

2422
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:38.810
There's trees

2423
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.180
<v 3>softer and easier is to live in the forest.</v>

2424
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.490
So hilarious.

2425
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:46.310
And now how the hell did they find you for this TV show?

2426
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.550
<v 1>I'm the creator of this show also created on another show called Flying Wild</v>

2427
01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:52.640
Alaska.

2428
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.473
And uh,

2429
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.970
I use those pilots to fly for me.

2430
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:58.460
And so I appeared on a couple of those episodes.

2431
01:03:58.461 --> 01:04:02.660
Sarah Pale and also did a show and she came out there to hunt and I'm,

2432
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.411
no,

2433
01:04:03.411 --> 01:04:05.030
I already had a family out there at the time.

2434
01:04:05.031 --> 01:04:06.440
It was very early in the hunting season,

2435
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:07.610
not a lot of animals around.

2436
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:11.030
So I flung her in a little plane further out because I had an eight and a 10

2437
01:04:11.031 --> 01:04:13.100
year old girl that we're hunting for the first time out there.

2438
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:15.170
And so,

2439
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.640
but they had seen me do these other shows.

2440
01:04:17.641 --> 01:04:20.030
So when he created the life below zero concept,

2441
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.201
he called and he says,

2442
01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:22.070
I've got this idea,

2443
01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:22.910
do you want to do it?

2444
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:24.230
And they came out and I said,

2445
01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:25.064
well,

2446
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.870
I never do anything scripted,

2447
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.710
period.

2448
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:30.170
I don't want to hear how you think would look cool and go do it yourself.

2449
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:30.531
I mean,

2450
01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:32.150
there's enough natural stuff that happens.

2451
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:33.500
That's what we stick to.

2452
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:36.230
And that's what the show does is it's,

2453
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:37.064
um,

2454
01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.930
I mean if we swear and go psycho,

2455
01:04:38.931 --> 01:04:40.370
I mean that shows it on TV.

2456
01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.580
If we pooch it and don't stock enough of something,

2457
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.660
well it's going to show that,

2458
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:45.530
um,

2459
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:47.090
or if you get hurt or whatever.

2460
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.373
Um,

2461
01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.011
so anyways,

2462
01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:50.810
they did the sizzle reel and I asked me and I said,

2463
01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:51.171
all right,

2464
01:04:51.171 --> 01:04:53.420
and as long as you don't ever ask me to do something stupid,

2465
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:54.010
you know.

2466
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:59.010
<v 3>Did you have any reservations about exposing yourself like this,</v>

2467
01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:03.670
about putting yourself on television and about showing this lifestyle?

2468
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.080
<v 1>I don't have any reservations about showing what I do.</v>

2469
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:07.501
Um,

2470
01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:09.060
there are some things,

2471
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:10.081
you know,

2472
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:13.500
privacy is privacy and I do expect a certain amount of it and I'm certainly,

2473
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:13.681
I,

2474
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:15.900
I treasure my alone time so I can,

2475
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.010
I can sometimes get an attitude about sharing that.

2476
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.360
Um,

2477
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.470
there is a trade off,

2478
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:20.741
you know,

2479
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:23.230
for me doing the show and the,

2480
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.970
and the premise that it does it on.

2481
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.280
One of the cool things for me is,

2482
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:27.821
you know,

2483
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.380
sooner or later my number's going to be up,

2484
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:29.661
you know,

2485
01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:30.570
all I've looked all over,

2486
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.230
there's no expiration date I can find.

2487
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:33.550
I just simply know what's coming.

2488
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.511
Now.

2489
01:05:34.511 --> 01:05:36.970
I may not ever get to meet my great grandchildren,

2490
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:38.650
but if they want to know who I was,

2491
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.910
pop in a DVD,

2492
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:41.230
they see who I really was,

2493
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:42.280
not who they thought I was.

2494
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.340
So that's a pretty cool tradeoff for me.

2495
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.680
Occasionally there,

2496
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:50.060
there is some unique territory that comes with

2497
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.920
being in a social setting.

2498
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.370
There are go to some of these sites and you know,

2499
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:58.660
I've had people send me emails,

2500
01:05:58.661 --> 01:05:59.770
why don't you just die?

2501
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.510
I hope a bear does each you,

2502
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.050
um,

2503
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:02.360
you know,

2504
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:02.561
it's like,

2505
01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:03.131
oh thanks.

2506
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:03.430
You know,

2507
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.110
whenever people have access,

2508
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.090
just any kind of access to people,

2509
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:10.270
there's going to be a certain amount of shit are going to do for me.

2510
01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:13.060
There's far more people that are positive,

2511
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:14.050
curious,

2512
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.530
and it's cool to touch this kind of a lifestyle.

2513
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:17.801
You know,

2514
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:21.790
some people romanticize the grizzly Adams thing and this is a way for them to

2515
01:06:21.791 --> 01:06:26.230
experience it without having to actually outrun a bear.

2516
01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:27.253
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2517
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:27.741
yeah.

2518
01:06:27.741 --> 01:06:29.060
That's how I feel about that show.

2519
01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.230
I don't have a desire to live a subsistence lifestyle,

2520
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:33.721
but I,

2521
01:06:33.721 --> 01:06:37.990
I really enjoy watching all these guys do it and you do it and we,

2522
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:38.661
you're the very,

2523
01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.660
you're very different than anybody else on the show because everybody else in

2524
01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:42.260
the show,

2525
01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.250
they live in a place where there's like woods and they have a house and like

2526
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:46.640
you,

2527
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.151
like I said,

2528
01:06:47.151 --> 01:06:48.830
you're the gangster of the gangsters.

2529
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.510
Like they're all pretty gangster.

2530
01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:51.261
They're all like,

2531
01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:51.531
you know,

2532
01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:52.364
there's the wine,

2533
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.990
<v 1>there's a unique set of challenges for each and every group.</v>

2534
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:56.211
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:06:56.211 --> 01:07:01.211
It's just such a weird way to live life and I think there's a trend that's going

2536
01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:02.961
on right now.

2537
01:07:02.961 --> 01:07:07.550
We're a lot of people feel a bit disenchanted with urban life.

2538
01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.630
And if you've seen the Werner Herzog documentary happy people,

2539
01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.290
no,

2540
01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:16.370
it's called happy people life on the taiga a year and the tiger,

2541
01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.260
the Tiger River in Siberia.

2542
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.130
And it's about these guys who are just hunters and trappers and they live,

2543
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:22.670
uh,

2544
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:26.840
this subsistence lifestyle in Siberia and they're incredibly happy.

2545
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:27.090
Yeah.

2546
01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:30.440
They're always joking around and smiling and laughing and,

2547
01:07:30.441 --> 01:07:30.600
okay.

2548
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.210
<v 1>And that's one thing maybe on the series you don't get to see.</v>

2549
01:07:33.211 --> 01:07:33.480
Um,

2550
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.340
I'm a really big goofball and I left La and I dance a lot and I just do by

2551
01:07:38.341 --> 01:07:39.180
herself though.

2552
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.870
Yeah.

2553
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:40.703
Yeah.

2554
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:42.160
There's a,

2555
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.570
there's a lot of footage because every time they do a timelapse I,

2556
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:45.991
oh,

2557
01:07:45.991 --> 01:07:46.680
what are you doing?

2558
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.031
Oh man,

2559
01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:47.940
it's been done for a little while.

2560
01:07:47.941 --> 01:07:50.580
We're just letting it run out while I go out there and I do these songs and

2561
01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:51.414
dances and,

2562
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.613
um,

2563
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.670
there's one really good video that they did and uh,

2564
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.541
but you know,

2565
01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.670
I swear too much so I can't go on the air.

2566
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.030
But,

2567
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:00.840
um,

2568
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.250
you don't do an Internet version.

2569
01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:02.980
Yeah,

2570
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.640
yeah.

2571
01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.410
<v 2>Put a uncensored clips,</v>

2572
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.430
give it a little warning.

2573
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:06.611
So,

2574
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:07.031
you know,

2575
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:07.781
when you're clicking on it,

2576
01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:07.920
I'm,

2577
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.731
<v 1>I'm pretty goofy.</v>

2578
01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:09.281
It's like me,

2579
01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:09.541
you know,

2580
01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:10.440
for the hunting sequence,

2581
01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:11.221
because you know,

2582
01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:11.820
for me,

2583
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.391
any of us,

2584
01:08:12.391 --> 01:08:14.730
when we go out hunting and there's a camera right behind you,

2585
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.441
you know,

2586
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:19.640
the very first episodes were learning experiences for us all.

2587
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:19.911
You know,

2588
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:22.610
I'm out there trying to get the Ptarmigan and they're all flying away,

2589
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:23.540
flying away and I'm,

2590
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:23.781
you know,

2591
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:24.561
bitches,

2592
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:24.861
you know,

2593
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:25.970
what the hell are they doing?

2594
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.331
Well,

2595
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:26.841
I turned around,

2596
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:29.330
here's the six foot something guy in a bright blue outfit going,

2597
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:29.570
dude,

2598
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:31.940
there are no six foot blueberries in the winter out here.

2599
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.230
Can you write it and get it down?

2600
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.010
You know,

2601
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.310
but,

2602
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.570
and so we've all learned,

2603
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:36.320
um,

2604
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.760
but sell for the hunting sequence,

2605
01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:38.810
me and my hilarity,

2606
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:39.051
you know,

2607
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.030
I went and got Cornish game hens and,

2608
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:41.540
uh,

2609
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.140
you know,

2610
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.400
what kind of a trail do they leave?

2611
01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:43.581
You know,

2612
01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:44.570
big sludge in the thing.

2613
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:45.710
So I have this whole thing,

2614
01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:47.060
where are they found on the shelf?

2615
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.120
So I did this whole hilarious sequence of a,

2616
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:50.361
you know,

2617
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:52.790
hunting the Cornish hens and uh,

2618
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.421
but you know,

2619
01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:53.990
I mean,

2620
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:56.240
all of us have a unique set of challenges.

2621
01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.590
Part of the challenge is still being in love with your lifestyle.

2622
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:01.424
At the end of the day,

2623
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.810
<v 2>there's just,</v>

2624
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:07.400
I think the cure to this sort of aimless life that a lot of people find

2625
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:09.200
themselves in when they're stuck in a cubicle,

2626
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:10.310
they're working for a company,

2627
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:11.150
the end of the day,

2628
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.960
they just go to sleep to get up again.

2629
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:14.030
They have to do it all over again.

2630
01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.630
It doesn't feel like they're connected to what they're doing or they,

2631
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:20.660
it doesn't feel like they have a passion for what they're doing.

2632
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:24.260
And then they see people that are live in the subsistence lifestyle and it has

2633
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:25.670
this romantic quality to it.

2634
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:26.080
The sort of,

2635
01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.690
yeah.

2636
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:26.901
<v 1>Well,</v>

2637
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:27.211
you know,

2638
01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:28.470
the society today,

2639
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:30.660
both people are going to have to go out and work.

2640
01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:33.750
They're going to have to work a lot of hours and not raising their own children

2641
01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.310
and they're eking out enough money just to pay the electric and the water.

2642
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.110
And do it all over again.

2643
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.320
Are you living life or are you just getting through it?

2644
01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:45.450
And is that the fault of the government?

2645
01:09:45.451 --> 01:09:45.901
Is that the,

2646
01:09:45.901 --> 01:09:46.171
you know,

2647
01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:46.411
I mean,

2648
01:09:46.411 --> 01:09:48.300
are you overgoverned I mean,

2649
01:09:48.301 --> 01:09:49.290
where is the break?

2650
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:53.460
Where's the profit margin on the company's gonna fall down short enough so that

2651
01:09:53.461 --> 01:09:57.480
the money a family makes you get your two weeks vacation and you go play in the

2652
01:09:57.481 --> 01:09:58.314
woods with your kids.

2653
01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.281
Right now,

2654
01:09:59.281 --> 01:10:00.270
people can't do that.

2655
01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.060
So I think these shows go look,

2656
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.391
you know,

2657
01:10:03.391 --> 01:10:08.040
there's people we're governed by the same law or just a little lawless about it.

2658
01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:08.891
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:13.891
I think the over competitive nature of a lot of people is led us to all agree to

2660
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:20.110
this really ridiculous life where you were working 50 plus hours a week and you

2661
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:22.030
don't really have a life outside of work.

2662
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:22.381
<v 1>Well,</v>

2663
01:10:22.381 --> 01:10:27.381
I can't imagine having to set my alarm clock and punch a clock for somebody else

2664
01:10:27.901 --> 01:10:28.734
anymore.

2665
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.131
You know,

2666
01:10:29.131 --> 01:10:29.890
I don't even,

2667
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:31.050
while I know I own a watch,

2668
01:10:31.051 --> 01:10:31.920
I don't know where I put it.

2669
01:10:31.921 --> 01:10:33.360
I lost it a few years ago.

2670
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.560
Um,

2671
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.090
but for me in the winter,

2672
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.451
you know,

2673
01:10:36.451 --> 01:10:39.930
I know when I get my first sunset again in late August,

2674
01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:41.130
I know I'm about a month before.

2675
01:10:41.131 --> 01:10:41.964
I don't see people.

2676
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.220
And then I don't even worry about the clock.

2677
01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:45.870
I wake up when I'm not tired.

2678
01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:47.040
I go to sleep when I'm tired.

2679
01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:47.731
If I'm hungry,

2680
01:10:47.731 --> 01:10:48.520
I eat.

2681
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:48.720
Um,

2682
01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.870
if I don't accept expend a lot of calories than I'm not hungry,

2683
01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:52.704
I don't take it in.

2684
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.100
<v 2>What do you do to attain yourself all throughout the,</v>

2685
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:56.300
the dead of the winter.

2686
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.020
<v 1>Um,</v>

2687
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.730
snow is the gift that keeps giving.

2688
01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:00.380
You can always dig and move snow.

2689
01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:00.800
Uh,

2690
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.180
try to keep the paths open.

2691
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.480
You know,

2692
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.610
the outhouse was a quarter mile away from where I'm at.

2693
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.680
When you've got to go,

2694
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:08.000
you need to,

2695
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:08.570
you know,

2696
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:09.050
wait a minute,

2697
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.530
Lord forbid you get the trots cause you got a long way to go when you punk could

2698
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:13.320
be in a blizzard.

2699
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.070
<v 3>Wait a minute,</v>

2700
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.070
your outhouse is a quarter of a mile away for over a mile away from my door.

2701
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:20.280
That's insane.

2702
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.700
Yeah.

2703
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.920
So every time you go you have to go a quarter mile.

2704
01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:24.123
<v 1>Yup.</v>

2705
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.240
That's,

2706
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:25.660
I mean,

2707
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.080
I,

2708
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:26.980
when nobody's there,

2709
01:11:26.981 --> 01:11:28.030
I mean I can just go outside,

2710
01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:29.500
drop my doors and take care of business.

2711
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:29.761
Right.

2712
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:31.360
You can get a five gallon bucket and do it there.

2713
01:11:31.361 --> 01:11:32.230
Cause he was watching.

2714
01:11:32.231 --> 01:11:35.350
I can walk around naked all day long and the windows open.

2715
01:11:35.351 --> 01:11:35.951
You know what I mean?

2716
01:11:35.951 --> 01:11:37.030
If that's what I wanna do.

2717
01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:37.930
Um,

2718
01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:39.730
but I'm setting the tone of my life,

2719
01:11:39.731 --> 01:11:40.630
not somebody else.

2720
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.670
<v 3>Why is the outhouse so far?</v>

2721
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.510
<v 1>Well they can,</v>

2722
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.910
I'm not allowed it to protect it ecosystem.

2723
01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:51.510
I can't dig a hole in the ground or have you going it because human waste is

2724
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:52.980
considered potentially hazardous.

2725
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.060
People take chemicals,

2726
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:54.721
I take drugs,

2727
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:55.554
they do whatever.

2728
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.990
So it has to be in a bin that has collected,

2729
01:11:57.991 --> 01:12:00.870
which I then have to separate the solids and the liquids and burn it to its

2730
01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:01.704
lowest dash.

2731
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.000
It can have an odor that some people don't like.

2732
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.720
Therefore you don't want it right next to the dining hall.

2733
01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.910
<v 3>But a quarter mile is really far.</v>

2734
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.990
<v 1>Not when the next cities 500 miles away.</v>

2735
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:16.720
It's all relative.

2736
01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.051
<v 3>Right.</v>

2737
01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:19.870
But when it's a hundred below zero,

2738
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.370
then I can always grab a bucket and do it in your pocket.

2739
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.670
Yeah,

2740
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.540
I mean you just adjust your own lifestyle.

2741
01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.460
And did you don't mind the summer walking a hundred you know whenever it is,

2742
01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:31.510
how many hundred yards,

2743
01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:33.700
how many hundred yards is a quarter mile mile?

2744
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.981
<v 1>Well,</v>

2745
01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:36.020
a quarter of a mile is 5,000 and chump change.

2746
01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:36.531
So you got what?

2747
01:12:36.531 --> 01:12:40.760
1200 to 1500 that you're going to go with a solid 500 yards.

2748
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:41.701
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2749
01:12:41.701 --> 01:12:42.534
you're wrong.

2750
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.470
I don't mind that.

2751
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:44.303
Why would I?

2752
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.260
I got a leg can and on,

2753
01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.580
you know something jumps out at me.

2754
01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:48.870
I'm going to jump out a leg.

2755
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:49.460
Cannon.

2756
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:49.830
Yeah.

2757
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:50.251
What do you do?

2758
01:12:50.251 --> 01:12:51.270
Like a 44 magnum.

2759
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:52.950
So I've got a couple of 44 MAG,

2760
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:53.560
so I'm have shorter

2761
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:53.871
<v 1>a barrel,</v>

2762
01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:56.560
some have longer barrels and I just got a four 54 pistol.

2763
01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.400
So with a chest harness there's something I'm going to be doing here in the near

2764
01:13:00.401 --> 01:13:03.340
future where I felt I needed something a little bigger,

2765
01:13:03.341 --> 01:13:06.370
a little closer to the chest because I'm going to need hands free.

2766
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:07.320
Okay.

2767
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:07.410
<v 3>Well,</v>

2768
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:08.210
what are you doing?

2769
01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:09.010
I can't tell you.

2770
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.090
Is that part of the show?

2771
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:10.720
Yes.

2772
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:10.991
Okay.

2773
01:13:10.991 --> 01:13:12.100
Well I'll tune in and I'll watch.

2774
01:13:12.101 --> 01:13:12.934
I'll learn from that.

2775
01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:14.973
Do you,

2776
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.080
do you anticipate like,

2777
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:21.130
do you have a plan of like how long you want to stay in this place or you just

2778
01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:23.230
merely like by your feelings?

2779
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.210
<v 1>For me personally,</v>

2780
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:26.631
no,

2781
01:13:26.631 --> 01:13:27.410
I don't plan.

2782
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.651
Uh,

2783
01:13:27.651 --> 01:13:28.041
you know,

2784
01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:28.760
when I,

2785
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.260
like I say Raven personality,

2786
01:13:30.261 --> 01:13:34.490
there may be something awesome that I find out about her I see or I want to do.

2787
01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:36.650
Or maybe I want to go gold panning for a while.

2788
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.360
I don't limit myself.

2789
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.690
My,

2790
01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:39.770
my vision is my own,

2791
01:13:39.771 --> 01:13:40.820
not anybody else's,

2792
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:45.350
but because I am only there through the grace of having a lease with the state

2793
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:47.630
and a profitable business,

2794
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.290
if that turns around or the state or anybody else says,

2795
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.861
look,

2796
01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.740
there's been a land swap and it's no longer owned by the state.

2797
01:13:54.741 --> 01:13:55.820
These people don't want you there.

2798
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:58.880
It may be out of my control when I leave.

2799
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.530
So,

2800
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:01.400
and that's something that,

2801
01:14:01.401 --> 01:14:01.641
you know,

2802
01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:02.810
I have to reconcile.

2803
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.790
I'm also not a spring chicken.

2804
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:06.320
Not that I'm the crypt keeper,

2805
01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:09.950
but my age and my body is starting to wear down,

2806
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.370
so need to read the signs.

2807
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:12.670
Right.

2808
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.503
You know,

2809
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.220
I mean life happens.

2810
01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:16.210
What if I,

2811
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:21.320
what if I can't see well anymore then hunting my own meat probably didn't going

2812
01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:22.390
to be real successful.

2813
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.081
Uh,

2814
01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:25.150
what if I break another couple of bones in my body?

2815
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:26.800
I just had some more foot surgery.

2816
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:29.980
I've got to have the feet work down again from when I broke them.

2817
01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.353
Um,

2818
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.880
I had a difficult time walking this summer,

2819
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.270
so I had one procedure done and I'm going to have a couple of more.

2820
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.860
What if that doesn't come back?

2821
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.910
<v 3>Are the bones just did the heel and</v>

2822
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.050
<v 1>I have a lot of scar tissue.</v>

2823
01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.880
The tendons reacted poorly.

2824
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.193
Um,

2825
01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.700
the a level of pain.

2826
01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:47.941
I mean,

2827
01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.350
I did it for a while,

2828
01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.640
but I was barely,

2829
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:51.660
you know,

2830
01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:52.231
walking.

2831
01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:52.681
So,

2832
01:14:52.681 --> 01:14:53.281
so they did,

2833
01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:54.630
I went down just to see the doctor.

2834
01:14:54.631 --> 01:14:56.250
He ended up doing surgery on both feet.

2835
01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:56.851
Um,

2836
01:14:56.851 --> 01:14:58.020
so that was kind of a trip,

2837
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.041
but a,

2838
01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:02.280
he wants to do some more procedures to try and help the situation.

2839
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.360
If it doesn't get better,

2840
01:15:03.361 --> 01:15:04.590
I have to change what I'm doing.

2841
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.170
<v 3>And then you also have the downtime after surgery.</v>

2842
01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:08.004
We can't do anything.

2843
01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:08.660
<v 1>No,</v>

2844
01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.740
I didn't take downtime.

2845
01:15:09.741 --> 01:15:10.550
I couldn't afford it,

2846
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:11.510
so I just dealt with it.

2847
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.170
Wow.

2848
01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:12.680
Um,

2849
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.280
this time I'm going to try to give myself two or three days of downtime,

2850
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.700
but life keeps happening whether I like it to or not,

2851
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.860
I can't let all of the chores go.

2852
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:22.550
Um,

2853
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:23.360
I have to,

2854
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.560
whether I like it or hate it,

2855
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:26.570
I have to keep fueling my heat tank.

2856
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.270
If I don't have fuel or oil in the heat tank,

2857
01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.133
I don't have heat.

2858
01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.010
Um,

2859
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:34.070
the longest I've gone without heat up there as two months and I just copied up

2860
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:37.250
in all my winter gear and waited for a funeral every two months.

2861
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.710
And I told him of the year was this,

2862
01:15:39.711 --> 01:15:41.930
that was in January,

2863
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.931
February.

2864
01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:46.820
The coldest time for us and it was not pleasant and I didn't enjoy it.

2865
01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.020
Um,

2866
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.050
and I don't necessarily ever want to do it again if I have to.

2867
01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:51.884
I have to,

2868
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:52.310
but,

2869
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.000
um,

2870
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.221
I,

2871
01:15:53.221 --> 01:15:54.054
I don't want to,

2872
01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:56.990
but you don't know what's going to be thrown at you.

2873
01:15:56.991 --> 01:15:57.291
What if,

2874
01:15:57.291 --> 01:15:57.710
uh,

2875
01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.570
what if a blizzard sends something,

2876
01:15:59.600 --> 01:15:59.841
you know,

2877
01:15:59.841 --> 01:16:02.600
somebody dropped a pop can on the Tundra and I don't know about it.

2878
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.910
In a 8,000 mile an hour breeze,

2879
01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:07.160
that's going to become a missile that might take out my tent.

2880
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.110
So I have to have several places,

2881
01:16:09.111 --> 01:16:12.470
another tent that I can go to and live in that gets taken out a trailer that I

2882
01:16:12.471 --> 01:16:13.880
can live in the cameras down,

2883
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.020
<v 3>get to those tents.</v>

2884
01:16:15.021 --> 01:16:17.250
So you have to be able to make our tasks,

2885
01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:21.470
but to get through the eight foot deep snow,

2886
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.810
<v 1>you tie ropes,</v>

2887
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.190
you can tie it to the roof line,

2888
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:25.450
you can tie it to the bottom

2889
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.820
<v 3>and you wear snowshoes and just walk on the top of it.</v>

2890
01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:28.620
<v 1>Uh,</v>

2891
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.550
you know when,

2892
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:30.990
when an emergency happens,

2893
01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:32.220
you don't get to pick what you're wearing.

2894
01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:35.820
But I don't get through eight foot deepest snow though.

2895
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:37.680
It depends on the type of snow.

2896
01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:38.341
If it's hard pack,

2897
01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:39.270
you walk on top of it,

2898
01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:39.630
it fits.

2899
01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:40.463
Softy swim.

2900
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:42.223
<v 3>Wow.</v>

2901
01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.630
So swim through the snow.

2902
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.500
How much has changed since you've been doing this television show?

2903
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:49.200
I mean it,

2904
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.090
has the attention of the show changed your lifestyle in any way?

2905
01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.220
Has it changed how you interact with the people that are coming into your camp?

2906
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.303
<v 1>Um,</v>

2907
01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:00.211
no.

2908
01:17:00.211 --> 01:17:02.010
I mean I am who I am.

2909
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.933
Uh,

2910
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.240
you know,

2911
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.140
I smoke cigars,

2912
01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:05.240
we'll single malt and,

2913
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.750
and a swear a lot.

2914
01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:07.950
Um,

2915
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.060
it doesn't change who I,

2916
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.510
the basic needs of the camp are set.

2917
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:12.680
Now,

2918
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.610
some people,

2919
01:17:13.611 --> 01:17:16.730
I don't have a lot of people that come in just because of the show.

2920
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:19.250
Kavach is extremely remote.

2921
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:24.610
The dollar value it takes to get to me precludes some people from being able to

2922
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:25.664
do it.

2923
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.460
Um,

2924
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.670
it has to be some crazy dude out there that's in love with you.

2925
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:30.120
They're watching the show there.

2926
01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:31.881
Is that what you're getting?

2927
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:32.690
That's Miguel.

2928
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:33.020
Yeah,

2929
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:33.920
there was a,

2930
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.010
there was one that showed up this year and I actually,

2931
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:39.320
for a couple of years I've been trying to set up,

2932
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.711
you know,

2933
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:40.281
and it was,

2934
01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:40.491
you know,

2935
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:41.690
bringing the family out to hunt,

2936
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.553
whatever.

2937
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.431
And then it was like,

2938
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:43.641
oh,

2939
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:44.210
they can't make it.

2940
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:45.021
Can I still come out?

2941
01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:45.420
Well yeah,

2942
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.490
it's going to cost this much,

2943
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:47.324
you know,

2944
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.470
assign their room to him.

2945
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.320
I'm busy working and come in and this person had moved into,

2946
01:17:51.321 --> 01:17:53.000
I call my personal building the twinkie.

2947
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:53.451
It's long,

2948
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:54.680
yellow and filled with goodness.

2949
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:55.370
Right?

2950
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.340
So I come in and here's this dude laying in my bed and uh,

2951
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:59.300
has decided that,

2952
01:17:59.301 --> 01:17:59.661
you know,

2953
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:00.710
we're in love and,

2954
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:05.000
and he had his old thing going on in his head and he got very upset when I told

2955
01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:07.220
them to get the hell out and he laid hands on me,

2956
01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:08.900
but as hands here and was holding the knife,

2957
01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:11.480
so I had the gun on my hip and put it in his dress and said,

2958
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:12.680
you just brought a knife to a gunfight.

2959
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:13.603
You lose.

2960
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.010
So I had military people,

2961
01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:18.500
some of the seals were there and they held the guy,

2962
01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:19.940
I called the plain and kicked him out.

2963
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.033
Just kick them out.

2964
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.120
Yeah.

2965
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.200
<v 2>Why don't you feed them to a bear?</v>

2966
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.320
Seems like that would be the best way to get rid of him.

2967
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:28.061
I wouldn't want that.

2968
01:18:28.061 --> 01:18:28.910
I've got coming back.

2969
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:29.700
<v 1>No,</v>

2970
01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:29.911
no.

2971
01:18:29.911 --> 01:18:30.181
Well,

2972
01:18:30.181 --> 01:18:31.014
all of the money,

2973
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.830
all of the Bush companies have a known all list and they know this person or

2974
01:18:34.831 --> 01:18:35.664
that person or this,

2975
01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.740
nobody flies in unless they ask me.

2976
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:38.480
Right.

2977
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.061
And then,

2978
01:18:39.061 --> 01:18:40.170
and the troopers know that.

2979
01:18:40.171 --> 01:18:41.430
Should I feel threatened?

2980
01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:41.850
I,

2981
01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:42.480
I,

2982
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.040
I'm not going to shoot for the knee caps.

2983
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:44.963
I'm going to take them out.

2984
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.890
Does anybody keep tabs in this fella?

2985
01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:49.390
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

2986
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:50.740
That's a bad human being.

2987
01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:51.960
And she just fed them to the Paris.

2988
01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:52.470
<v 1>Uh,</v>

2989
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.801
you know,

2990
01:18:52.801 --> 01:18:53.640
that's not my,

2991
01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.110
my Gig is just getting them out.

2992
01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:56.280
Yeah.

2993
01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:56.720
You know,

2994
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.210
um,

2995
01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:58.080
it was a,

2996
01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:01.590
it's like anything you neutralize the threat kick 'em out,

2997
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.120
chances are,

2998
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.013
um,

2999
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.221
I mean,

3000
01:19:05.221 --> 01:19:08.100
they got to live with themselves and they're probably not gonna want to

3001
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:09.690
embarrass themselves again.

3002
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:14.430
<v 2>So people have an amazing ability to distort reality in their head to the point</v>

3003
01:19:14.431 --> 01:19:16.850
where it's not living with themselves the rest of the world.

3004
01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:17.010
Yeah.

3005
01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:19.440
<v 1>I get interested in email sometimes and,</v>

3006
01:19:19.441 --> 01:19:20.274
uh,

3007
01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:22.800
men in prison seem to find me awfully sexy.

3008
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.760
Um,

3009
01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:26.491
and none of them,

3010
01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:27.241
they're all innocent.

3011
01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:28.600
I'll tell you that much that they're like,

3012
01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:29.580
if I just get out,

3013
01:19:29.581 --> 01:19:30.414
I could live with her.

3014
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.980
There's one,

3015
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:36.390
he's done 27 years of four consecutive life sentences for killing his wives.

3016
01:19:36.391 --> 01:19:37.224
He didn't do it.

3017
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:38.423
How many wives?

3018
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:40.103
Four wives.

3019
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:41.400
He told all four of them that well,

3020
01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:42.234
he didn't do it.

3021
01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:43.913
He's been frame,

3022
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:47.410
but clearly he and I belonged together and uh,

3023
01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:48.630
whenever,

3024
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.961
you know,

3025
01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:49.780
it's a Oh

3026
01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:52.440
<v 2>Mariam and I think you'd be good in all conjugal visits.</v>

3027
01:19:52.441 --> 01:19:53.490
Probably not going to happen.

3028
01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:54.030
Yeah,

3029
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.270
no,

3030
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:55.260
don't marriage to say,

3031
01:19:55.261 --> 01:19:56.094
listen,

3032
01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.720
you seem to be killing wives.

3033
01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.320
Yeah.

3034
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.340
Key this relationship.

3035
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:01.330
Let's just keep the topic.

3036
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:03.410
Do you,

3037
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.691
you know,

3038
01:20:03.691 --> 01:20:06.180
you could do your own show like really easily,

3039
01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:06.600
like,

3040
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.240
you know mean I enjoy the,

3041
01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:09.780
the show life below zero.

3042
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:12.360
But you're such a powerful personality.

3043
01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:12.991
It's all,

3044
01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:13.231
I mean,

3045
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:15.390
I guarantee you there's a lot of people that are just like,

3046
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:16.500
fuck all the rest of these people.

3047
01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:18.270
I want to find out what Sue's up to all day.

3048
01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:19.650
Can you just such a,

3049
01:20:19.651 --> 01:20:21.410
you were very rare human.

3050
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.710
<v 1>Got It.</v>

3051
01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:25.310
That's probably a good thing for some people that you're rare.

3052
01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:26.110
Yeah,

3053
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.231
<v 2>well,</v>

3054
01:20:26.231 --> 01:20:26.710
I dunno,

3055
01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:27.543
why not?

3056
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:30.600
We can be all right with a bunch of you are running around me.

3057
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.710
It probably wouldn't happen.

3058
01:20:32.711 --> 01:20:34.060
But you know,

3059
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.830
if you thought about doing your own version or an a another show that just kind

3060
01:20:38.831 --> 01:20:40.390
of entirely focuses on you,

3061
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.311
<v 1>you know,</v>

3062
01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:43.200
that's not something I would think about.

3063
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:43.920
Um,

3064
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.590
that would be something that a network might present.

3065
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:47.610
They must be like,

3066
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:51.290
<v 2>can get you and realizing that this is this incredible personality that's</v>

3067
01:20:51.291 --> 01:20:51.950
attached to it.

3068
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.630
I know you probably don't like to think about yourself that way.

3069
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:54.151
<v 1>No,</v>

3070
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.450
I like,

3071
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:54.631
you know,

3072
01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:56.400
people say there are some people,

3073
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:56.611
it's like,

3074
01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:57.031
oh my gosh,

3075
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:57.864
you're a star.

3076
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:58.141
And I go,

3077
01:20:58.141 --> 01:20:58.471
no,

3078
01:20:58.471 --> 01:20:59.310
I'm just a fat chick.

3079
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:00.091
You know,

3080
01:21:00.091 --> 01:21:00.801
living on the tone.

3081
01:21:00.801 --> 01:21:01.061
Right.

3082
01:21:01.061 --> 01:21:01.471
You know,

3083
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:02.304
I mean,

3084
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.700
don't put yourself on a pedestal unless you like falling from high places.

3085
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.020
Sooner or later.

3086
01:21:07.021 --> 01:21:09.000
A honey booboo is around the corner and you're done.

3087
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:11.290
So if you put yourself on a pedestal,

3088
01:21:11.291 --> 01:21:12.160
that's a pretty big job,

3089
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:13.130
you know?

3090
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.730
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3091
01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:13.971
no,

3092
01:21:13.971 --> 01:21:14.131
I,

3093
01:21:14.131 --> 01:21:14.990
I agree.

3094
01:21:14.991 --> 01:21:15.800
But I just think,

3095
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.191
you know,

3096
01:21:16.191 --> 01:21:19.310
you obviously enjoy some aspects of being on the show.

3097
01:21:19.311 --> 01:21:20.750
Otherwise he would have told them to fuck off.

3098
01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.430
<v 1>I do occasionally,</v>

3099
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.791
you know,

3100
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.410
we all go through our diva moments.

3101
01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:25.483
Um,

3102
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.670
<v 2>do kick them out sometimes</v>

3103
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.620
<v 1>we have butted heads a few times and,</v>

3104
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:32.190
um,

3105
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.060
I have,

3106
01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:35.710
I call it putting them in timeout and I just locked myself in the,

3107
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:36.920
in the twinkie and I don't,

3108
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.070
you know,

3109
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.630
um,

3110
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:39.690
but they've,

3111
01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.650
they've been very,

3112
01:21:40.651 --> 01:21:41.820
very respectful.

3113
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:42.900
Occasionally.

3114
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:43.853
It's

3115
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:44.630
<v 0>okay,</v>

3116
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.900
<v 1>too much social time for me and I have to,</v>

3117
01:21:47.901 --> 01:21:50.570
I have to get my alone time just to get it back in perspective.

3118
01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:51.850
And how much

3119
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.140
<v 2>time did they spend filming?</v>

3120
01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:56.050
Do they only come in the summer or the only there for a couple months out of the

3121
01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:56.340
year?

3122
01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.173
<v 1>No,</v>

3123
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:58.800
throughout the year.

3124
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.920
Because if you notice there are winner episodes and then there were a summer

3125
01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:02.754
episodes.

3126
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.470
So throughout the year,

3127
01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:04.800
um,

3128
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.790
they're very respectful.

3129
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:06.421
They call and they say,

3130
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:06.601
Hey,

3131
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:07.710
what are you up to for?

3132
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.030
I don't know until like,

3133
01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:09.211
you know,

3134
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:11.070
from now until the 25th of November,

3135
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:11.701
well,

3136
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:12.301
I'm going to do this,

3137
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:14.070
this and this and this is going to happen and fuck,

3138
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:14.910
I didn't get that done.

3139
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:15.451
Well,

3140
01:22:15.451 --> 01:22:15.661
Hey,

3141
01:22:15.661 --> 01:22:17.910
do you think we can come and cover this and this and this?

3142
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:18.211
And I'll go,

3143
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:18.481
no,

3144
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:20.500
I want to do this by myself cause I might bonehead it.

3145
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:21.810
Don't need that Andre on the air.

3146
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:23.130
But um,

3147
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:23.641
you know,

3148
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:23.821
I go,

3149
01:22:23.821 --> 01:22:24.091
yeah,

3150
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:24.810
we can do this.

3151
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:25.381
That'd be cool.

3152
01:22:25.381 --> 01:22:25.561
Yeah,

3153
01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:26.394
you can tag along.

3154
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.261
And so they're,

3155
01:22:27.261 --> 01:22:28.650
they're respectful of asking me,

3156
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:29.401
what am I doing?

3157
01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:31.310
Do I mind having company and,

3158
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:32.610
and let's get it together.

3159
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:34.980
So there's no real set shooting schedule.

3160
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:37.140
It's essentially just like decide,

3161
01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.440
let's say Kate and Andy may be doing something,

3162
01:22:40.441 --> 01:22:41.070
you know,

3163
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:44.310
everybody else's location is vastly different

3164
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:47.530
temperatures and,

3165
01:22:47.531 --> 01:22:47.901
and you know,

3166
01:22:47.901 --> 01:22:48.381
than I am.

3167
01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:48.501
I,

3168
01:22:48.501 --> 01:22:48.861
I'm,

3169
01:22:48.861 --> 01:22:49.940
I'm way up there.

3170
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.360
Right.

3171
01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.830
So my winter is much,

3172
01:22:51.831 --> 01:22:52.700
much longer.

3173
01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:52.930
Um,

3174
01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:53.960
my freeze up is much,

3175
01:22:53.961 --> 01:22:55.280
much different.

3176
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:56.091
Um,

3177
01:22:56.091 --> 01:22:57.620
they may break up before I do.

3178
01:22:57.621 --> 01:22:57.891
So,

3179
01:22:57.891 --> 01:22:58.161
I mean,

3180
01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:01.560
we all have to be given the respect of our individual areas and,

3181
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:02.450
and the show does that.

3182
01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.590
<v 2>That's amazing.</v>

3183
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.711
Well,

3184
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:04.041
listen,

3185
01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:05.000
you gotta get Outta here,

3186
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.460
know you get some other stuff to do with,

3187
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:07.930
thank you so much for doing this.

3188
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.890
I really appreciate it.

3189
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:11.830
I really enjoy you on the show and I just think you're awesome.

3190
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:12.760
Thank you so much.

3191
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.490
Love talking to you.

3192
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.840
Okay.

3193
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.920
Thanks so much for the Caribbean.

3194
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.820
I would love to,

3195
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:16.481
I would love to,

3196
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:17.860

3197

3198
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:19.660

3199
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:21.910
It's sue Akins on Twitter,

3201
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.460
life below zero t.

3202
01:23:25.461 --> 01:23:26.294
V.

3203
