00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I taught fourth grade and now those kids are grown up and that's really cool</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>because some of them told me it was the best year of their lives.</v>

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>They come to see me do stand up.</v>

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:12.991
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

8
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>

9
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Will you teach and what grade?</v>

10
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

11
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>At everything,</v>

12
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but oh,</v>

13
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>fourth grade is different than science.</v>

14
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

15
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:19.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

17
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>it's different than what you did because you went to some people who had an</v>

18
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>interest and a love for something and wanted to explore it what you were doing.</v>

19
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>But mine is different.</v>

20
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>They had to be there.</v>

21
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So my thing was self doubt,</v>

22
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.724
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

23
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I figured I can't teach them.</v>

24
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>These subjects are going to come and go in their lives,</v>

25
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but teaching them self esteem and some of the most rewarding things where like</v>

26
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>had this one kid who was real shy,</v>

28
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.483
<v Speaker 1>so shy,</v>

29
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>he was real tall and he was embarrassed by it and he would stay in the,</v>

30
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>in the cloak room,</v>

31
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>they'd call it a,</v>

32
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we're all the coats and you just stay in there.</v>

34
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.811
<v Speaker 1>It won't come out.</v>

35
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>they can't stay,</v>

41
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't let a kid just sit and,</v>

42
00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of me just like work in his self esteem and all,</v>

44
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>he was in the middle of the class,</v>

45
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>just what everybody else waving his hand and his mother came up to me and she</v>

46
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>was like really touched by it and told me that I changed his life and,</v>

47
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:14.920

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

58
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>because you were smarter than me.</v>

59
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.721
<v Speaker 1>I said she'd go to me.</v>

60
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.021
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.261
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

62
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know I wasn't smart enough to know that I wasn't.</v>

66
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.910

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

68
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>So you were an easy teacher.</v>

69
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what I told them at the beginning of the year.</v>

70
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:44.581
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

71
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

72
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.070

<v Speaker 1>That must have been.</v>

76
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.141
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

77
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the gym.</v>

78
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was playing basketball.</v>

79
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:54.781
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

80
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the gym more than you do.</v>

81
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to have a party.</v>

82
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Every Friday afternoon we'd have.</v>

83
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>We'd have kids that would do break dancing and stuff and really?</v>

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.404
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

87
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever try to pitch that as a sitcom a no,</v>

88
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but somebody else had an idea for a couple of times would be hilarious.</v>

89
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Sitcom.</v>

90
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a natural.</v>

91
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92

<v Speaker 1>You as a,</v>

93
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>as a funny teacher because you really did it.</v>

94
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's legit and if you really stop and think about it,</v>

95
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>that would be like for a kid that's like one of the greatest rolls of the dice</v>

96
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>and kicked and get for their fourth grade teacher.</v>

109
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.600

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>That'll keep you from being a dirty bird.</v>

115
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

116
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.400

00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 1>Let her talk call you.</v>

121
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Darwish.</v>

122
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Trying to establish boundaries.</v>

123
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.961
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said,</v>

124
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>why do you feel young?</v>

125
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I go because I can come on.</v>

126
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that becoming more aware or reaching a higher state of</v>

127
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 2>consciousness because of your experiences will actually help you because it'll</v>

128
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>abandoned a lot of the distractions that you present yourself almost</v>

129
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 2>unknowingly.</v>

130
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Well it helps me.</v>

132
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 2>It helps me in training and particularly when I'm running now because I used to</v>

133
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:31.261
<v Speaker 2>listen to like Pantera and patient disorder when I was running and I had worked</v>

134
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>myself into like a rage so I wouldn't run into exhaustion.</v>

135
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of how they're trained and not trained all the way through my</v>

136
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.720
<v Speaker 2>career like that and the last couple of fights,</v>

137
00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:39.311
<v Speaker 2>so sweet stuff.</v>

138
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I listened to a lot more like,</v>

139
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>like more like blind binaural beat type of stuff when I'm running so I could get</v>

140
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>into more like a meditative stage,</v>

141
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of yoga as well and trying to find the same thing where you just,</v>

143
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

144
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

145
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

146
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you're within yourself and you're not focusing on anything else.</v>

147
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>So your body's almost like on autopilot.</v>

148
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.581
<v Speaker 2>That the music that you listened to when you train can have a profound effect on</v>

150
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 2>how you approach your training.</v>

151
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.603
<v Speaker 2>It ready can,</v>

152
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.491
<v Speaker 2>it's so important.</v>

153
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I've always been so vocal about all this stuff I listen to.</v>

154
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd,</v>

155
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I'd like training camp playlist,</v>

156
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>so I tweet everyday trump songs I was listening to and that kind of thing is</v>

157
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

158
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

159
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.430
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

160
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing as well,</v>

161
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like earlier on in my career,</v>

162
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I would use music to anchor feelings.</v>

163
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

164
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>

165
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>when I fought Ludwig I used the song called Ian by Woodkid,</v>

166
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>which was the first time I'd switched from Angola belongs to me for like,</v>

167
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of fives.</v>

169
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

170
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>so like for the 12 weeks of that fight I was training with Frank Mir,</v>

171
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>we were going to read it.</v>

172
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It's up to Mount Charleston and now into red rock and like doing hill running</v>

173
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.551
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

174
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And we had some real tough sessions.</v>

175
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

176
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 2>we're ready to put ourselves through for that training camp.</v>

178
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I got back in my truck,</v>

179
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.481
<v Speaker 2>after the session,</v>

180
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.111
<v Speaker 2>after the session,</v>

181
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>if I felt like it was a good session that was productive and I felt positive,</v>

182
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I would put that song on and say I would constantly connect those feelings to</v>

183
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>that song.</v>

184
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So then when,</v>

185
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>when I'm walking out and that song comes on,</v>

186
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 2>immediately I get that feeling again and it's just like,</v>

187
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:02.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 2>just like when you listen to a sermon,</v>

189
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>you think of a person like,</v>

190
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.441
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

191
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I heard that someone was with that person and you made that connection</v>

192
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

193
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 2>but you can also train yourself to do it.</v>

194
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you like allison to Cypress Hill now and it will take me back to</v>

195
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>fighting in cage warriors like back in 2006.</v>

196
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

197
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.510
<v Speaker 2>And I have songs all the way through like that now I don't listen to because it</v>

198
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>was like my first two fights.</v>

199
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I came back to Pantera,</v>

200
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>drag the waters.</v>

201
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 2>By the time I got to the cage I was so wound up and so angry that I was just run</v>

202
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>out of gas immediately.</v>

203
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.793
<v Speaker 2>Know what I mean?</v>

204
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And now whenever I listened to those songs,</v>

205
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I get that feeling of light exhaustion.</v>

206
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:41.134
<v Speaker 2>Like ugh.</v>

207
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Speaker 2>And I look at what's out there.</v>

208
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Some answers make no sense to me and they seem to lead down really unhealthy</v>

209
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

210
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

211
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.543
<v Speaker 2>But no thanks.</v>

212
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Are there answers?</v>

213
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Make more sense,</v>

214
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.450
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they don't and I come up with my own,</v>

215
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but is it really is boiled down to the Bruce Lee,</v>

216
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>research your own experience,</v>

218
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>a reject what is useless,</v>

219
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>absorb what is useful and what specific or year on,</v>

220
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:03.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

221
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>his methodology for how to approach knowledge.</v>

222
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 2>he applied it to martial arts by reading is a brilliant way of approach.</v>

224
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Just any kind of knowledge,</v>

225
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 2>whether it is really.</v>

226
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.073
<v Speaker 2>It's about life.</v>

227
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:17.820
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for people to accept that.</v>

229
00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

230
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's much easier to follow the pattern that you families followed.</v>

231
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Lutheran because grandma's Lutheran,</v>

232
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:24.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.190
<v Speaker 2>GRANDPA always said that no matter what,</v>

234
00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:27.240
<v Speaker 2>we'll be Lutherans.</v>

235
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

236
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I remember talking to this girl and uh,</v>

237
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.060
<v Speaker 2>she said that she was going to get a tattoo of a cross and I said,</v>

238
00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:33.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

239
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

240
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

241
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.801

243
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.270

244
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.481
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:36.961
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

246
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

247
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I was born Catholic and I figured,</v>

248
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.913
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>

249
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing that will be for the rest of my life.</v>

250
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

251

252
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.140
<v Speaker 2>and I remember saying and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know her very well,</v>

255
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:48.180
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

261
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:52.771
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

262

288
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>place because like in the Bible it very specifically says,</v>
