1
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>The job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real good experience.</v>

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Well all day we don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's panicky wet.</v>

3
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 2>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm suddenly faced with adversity and my</v>

4
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 2>botox is running out so my head is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually able to squint.</v>

5
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Just order an uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the rain hits you,</v>

6
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:39.971
<v Speaker 1>you'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you just watched somebody else </v>

7
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:39.971
<v Speaker 1>freak out and you think about it like he</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts thinking that.</v>

8
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>How much has this guy been screened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:46.751
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was I supposed to be getting picked up </v>

10
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>by a lyft driver and the uber driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>intercepted the signal or did.</v>

11
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Did Uber know about all that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're uber employees were calling </v>

12
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like one guy was doing it like </v>

13
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>one guy was like pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were calling like Uber Rides or </v>

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Uber was calling lyft rides and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just canceling the Gig really </v>

15
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their bitch is fucking up their business</v>

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>prank calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fake fake orders for cars and shit.</v>

17
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really.</v>

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole company does not want to use a</v>

19
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>company when you hear shit like</v>

20
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's what it takes this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody took the Glen Gary,</v>

21
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Glen Ross</v>

22
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>first scene to heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing that at every level of Uber.</v>

23
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want coffee,</v>

24
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>you got to be a fucking closer coffee's </v>
<v Speaker 1>for closers.</v>

25
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish,</v>

26
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like Uber was doing so </v>

27
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.831
<v Speaker 1>well like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wished there would be a company </v>

28
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>like that that would turn out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>super cool.</v>

29
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wished that about every company</v>

30
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be nice if they're super </v>

32
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>cool?</v>

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like secretly all of Walmart's money was</v>

34
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 3>going to some kind of charity instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

35
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Walmart is always going to be a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that in a good way or a</v>

36
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 1>bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means just like whenever you have a </v>

37
00:01:58.721 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 1>big giant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem on both sides.</v>

38
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one problem is people go,</v>

39
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Walmart comes into town and it kills all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small businesses and are we really?</v>

41
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.811
<v Speaker 1>That grows that like saving a dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and five cents there is worth us </v>

42
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:16.121
<v Speaker 1>going to some giant box where some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are in it that we don't know or </v>

43
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>are we going to go to our local place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we have like a relationship with </v>

44
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>the people that own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this small connection,</v>

45
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>like you're directly connected to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

46
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I think the issue at least where I fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>up as a consumer is you drive by and </v>

47
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.931
<v Speaker 3>let's say you need a new tire for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>car and you know you don't really care </v>

48
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 3>about your car that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Corolla or whatever that has</v>

49
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 3>the cheapest tires in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like ideologically I don't really </v>

50
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.041
<v Speaker 3>care who my tire replacement person is </v>
<v Speaker 3>or their wellbeing or their quality of </v>

51
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want the cheapest tire.</v>

52
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 3>See I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

53
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And then like it spills over into other </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas of your life where you're like,</v>

54
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:55.781
<v Speaker 3>well I want healthy groceries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if Walmart can give me the </v>

55
00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 3>cheapest fucking lettuce?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then maybe I just don't care.</v>

56
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I send a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think eventually just buy everything </v>

57
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

58
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Well it can definitely go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're a smart consumer,</v>

60
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you're worried about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just worried about numbers,</v>

61
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's companies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't have a relationship with.</v>

62
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel bad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

63
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:18.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a relationship with whole </v>

64
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:18.921
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them.</v>

65
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:18.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go there.</v>

66
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>The folks are all nice that worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

67
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.860
<v Speaker 1>but I know they're just working there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the guys where you get the Kale</v>

68
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Salad from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Cool.</v>

69
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:29.091
<v Speaker 1>Say Hi to say hi to the butcher Chit </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chat with the people at the cash </v>

70
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:29.091
<v Speaker 1>register.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

71
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's friendly.</v>

72
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>But I know that their employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

73
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't feel connected to giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them my money,</v>

74
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but like this restaurant that I go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and the folks that own it,</v>

75
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>they've owned it for like 30 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just the nicest,</v>

76
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>friendliest people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just really cool to talk to.</v>

77
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:50.871
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guys from Greece and he's </v>

78
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>always telling me about like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the way people behave</v>

79
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>there and behave here and just I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these cool conversations with him.</v>

80
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He's a very bright well read guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an interesting guy.</v>

81
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So I love going there and giving them my</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

82
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 1>But if I go to like applebee's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know anybody.</v>

83
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 16 year old hostess,</v>

84
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to be there next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be somebody else.</v>

85
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll be friendly to them for </v>

86
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

87
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it's nice if you get the same waitress </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

88
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you doing was no culture there </v>

89
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

90
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we,</v>

91
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>we miss in like losing those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>small businesses,</v>

92
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first small business owner,</v>

93
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking grind.</v>

94
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to,</v>

95
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to really be selling something </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody wants.</v>

96
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking starbucks down the </v>

97
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>street here and next to the starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a shoe dealer,</v>

98
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 1>like a not a shoe dealer shoe repairman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

99
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many fucking people are getting</v>

100
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>their shoes repaired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 1>is there some like death of a salesman </v>
<v Speaker 1>type still out there need to get their </v>

102
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>shoes polished before an interview?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

103
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:55.451
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you have enough people in an </v>

104
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:55.451
<v Speaker 1>area that is going to be enough.</v>

105
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>People wear heels or falling off and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean maybe I'm naive,</v>

106
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but every time I go by that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking nobody in it.</v>

107
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell's kitchen?</v>

108
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Their shoes fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would dress up like Jay gatsby one day</v>

109
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and just go in there and pull up in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>big yellow convertible that he had.</v>

110
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Then Leonardo Dicaprio had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super torn on that movie.</v>

111
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I was torn on it in two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

112
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it was like so surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was so crazy.</v>

113
00:05:20.151 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the way it was filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so obvious like you were watching</v>

114
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.020
<v Speaker 1>a dream or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

115
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It was the special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they were at the party and the</v>

116
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.420
<v Speaker 1>glitter was flying and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing.</v>

117
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he was driving over the top.</v>

118
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It was almost hard to accept it as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a real story,</v>

119
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>like watching a story about real humans.</v>

120
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I think that goes back to the book </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

121
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember liking it a lot in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and college and thinking like </v>

122
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.120
<v Speaker 3>this is what life was like back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day in New York.</v>

123
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 3>And then you get older and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not life at all.</v>

124
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 3>That's just some frivolous bullshit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody thought up.</v>

125
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.480
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 3>romance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a romance narrative</v>

127
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>within the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has no application of modern life at </v>

128
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking fantasy.</v>

129
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>What's a sad ending with phantom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.620
<v Speaker 1>there is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure much more than there is now to </v>

131
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>someone who has a completely fabricated </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

132
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>There's something we all think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing about that.</v>

133
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Like someone who could just fabricate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life and like how long can they </v>

134
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>pull it off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a great plot engine,</v>

135
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>which he's good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dicaprio is like the master of being the</v>

136
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a movie he was in?</v>

137
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Where use the con artists kind of Wolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Wall Street or the wolf of Wall </v>

138
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm thinking of um,</v>

139
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.400
<v Speaker 1>catch me if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

140
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

141
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And then really remember that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

142
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't get as much credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's beautiful and he's a,</v>

143
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

144
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>He's beautiful and he's kind of a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always the case for us.</v>

145
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well him especially I'm in,</v>

146
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of the greatest actors </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

147
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's such a beautiful man and he's </v>

148
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously so privileged.</v>

149
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.620
<v Speaker 1>People look at him like this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

150
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

152
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>if that guy was ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be saluted.</v>

153
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:10.361
<v Speaker 1>He would be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget what Steve Buschemi gets kind of </v>

<v Speaker 1>he's too pretty.</v>

159
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Even if he gets a couple of scars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They chip away the surface of your teeth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put this new surface.</v>

233
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 1>All of your permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

234
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a veneer.</v>

235
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a like this would if you took </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really thin slice of this wood and put</v>

236
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.730
<v Speaker 1>it over some plastic bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretended it was oak.</v>

237
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this perfect white ceramic </v>

238
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.681
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like a ceramic or some may </v>

239
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:47.681
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be something like</v>

240
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.970
<v Speaker 1>some plastic veneer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

241
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.810
<v Speaker 1>but what like what is it made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

242
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like billiard ball type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenolic hookup.</v>

243
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>How you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it done.</v>

244
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy did this guys are too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what's going on.</v>

245
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he just decided to get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth or something like that.</v>

246
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.010
<v Speaker 1>But I'm looking at him talking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's wearing like a little bit of a</v>

247
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been honest.</v>

248
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.560
<v Speaker 1>This weird kick lately where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by people altering their </v>

249
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.970
<v Speaker 1>image like radically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got onto with Renee Zellweger,</v>

250
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.430
<v Speaker 1>like I saw that renee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renee Zellweger thing.</v>

251
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 1>That is like the textbook case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

252
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then is and Jennifer Gray?</v>

253
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not chatter for Greg.</v>

254
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Is that her from dirty dancing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was her name?</v>

255
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Gray.</v>

256
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.950
<v Speaker 1>She was really pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had a big nose.</v>

257
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Then she got her nose fixed.</v>

258
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it works.</v>

259
00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Is it Jennifer Gray?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

260
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 1>she was really pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

261
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:47.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a Jewish looking knows that </v>

262
00:11:47.411 --> 00:11:48.890
<v Speaker 1>European hump thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just character,</v>

263
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

264
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

265
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Plus it disappears if you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead at anything.</v>

266
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she was cute and then she became,</v>

267
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.050
<v Speaker 1>she likes it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

269
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>she's a different person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

270
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got on this kick lately where I </v>

271
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:07.890
<v Speaker 1>started looking at all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>different procedures that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done and uh,</v>

273
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I watched a nose job yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me a nose job on twitter </v>

274
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 1>this woman getting her nose fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it.</v>

276
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.990
<v Speaker 1>You can see it on my twitter page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a long video of the entire </v>

277
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sped up a bit,</v>

278
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>but holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it brutal?</v>

279
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Like the nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

280
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:36.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my nose cleaned out like I had my </v>

281
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.391
<v Speaker 1>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deviated septum repair to has smashed </v>

282
00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:42.061
<v Speaker 1>Septum and it was blocking off most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my ability to breathe out of my </v>

283
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>nostrils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

284
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:48.991
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was way more involved because they </v>

285
00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:51.181
<v Speaker 1>had to actually chip away her bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They peeled her nose back like a banana </v>

286
00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and then chipped away the bone to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nose smaller and then put it all </v>

287
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.611
<v Speaker 1>together again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing the lengths people go </v>

288
00:12:59.611 --> 00:12:59.611
<v Speaker 1>to to do something that nobody cares </v>
<v Speaker 1>about any way?</v>

289
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do care though.</v>

290
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

291
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>

292
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't look better once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix their fucked up nose because.</v>

293
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renee Zellweger,</v>

294
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:14.191
<v Speaker 1>nobody would have cared if she had just </v>
<v Speaker 1>aged and looked somewhat like she used </v>

295
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:17.581
<v Speaker 1>to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that you don't have the right to </v>

296
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>change your appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just that that sudden shock.</v>

297
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>That kind of surprised people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

299
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a young man and you make your </v>

300
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>living off of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

301
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You make your living off of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary,</v>

302
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>your ability to notice things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting,</v>

303
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm much older than you.</v>

304
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:42.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm 47 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my brain doesn't work any </v>

305
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>differently than when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body is slowly but surely starting to</v>

306
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>work less good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I get injured more easily.</v>

307
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I still work out pretty hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I get injured like I fucked my </v>

308
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 1>elbow up a couple months ago in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch just won't get better.</v>

309
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those kinds of things.</v>

310
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not a professional athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was,</v>

311
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I would be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was,</v>

312
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd be freaking out if I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional talker,</v>

313
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Speaker 1>if my brain started to slowly slow down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my brain started not able to form </v>

314
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 1>sentences or not being able to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>and objective behavior problems or you </v>

315
00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:22.781
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion of what the topic is I'm </v>

316
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:22.781
<v Speaker 1>discussing.</v>

317
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 1>If those types of things started </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on a regular basis and someone</v>

318
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 1>came along and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

319
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.680
<v Speaker 1>we can give you this drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

320
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna make you 70 percent better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you're getting old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to shoot your forehead up </v>

323
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>with botulism and it's going to freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing so you can't,</v>

324
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't look frown and then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

325
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It will make you look a little better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

326
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

327
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with your fucking.</v>

328
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>But to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like my forehead's lynee anymore.</v>

329
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acting career has been extended </v>

330
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe people are just going to get </v>

331
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:55.780
<v Speaker 1>weirded out by you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

332
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that Dutchess who's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some an godly amount of money,</v>

333
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>but she's had like insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic surgery and she's just taken ill</v>

334
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>just pull.</v>

335
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.500
<v Speaker 1>If you buy better view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up Dutchess plastic surgery </v>

336
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>disaster you see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this poor lady,</v>

337
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:17.290
<v Speaker 1>when she was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was very pretty and obviously that </v>

338
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>meant a lot to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a big part of who she was,</v>

339
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:23.350
<v Speaker 1>not just a part of who she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like most of her world probably for </v>

340
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of beautiful women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>

341
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you're born with the greatest lottery </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket ever.</v>

342
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Like everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just tripping over themselves</v>

343
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>to get to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be nice to you,</v>

344
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>to get close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you things,</v>

345
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's really just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of your face and your body.</v>

346
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible and you have to be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of shit to fuck that up.</v>

347
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Like to like to get it so that men don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk to you.</v>

348
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're perfectly designed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be like really annoying,</v>

349
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be like really mean are </v>

350
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>really selfish or were guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how hot she is out of here,</v>

351
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

352
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>there's almost always going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitor.</v>

353
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a good picture of her by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not kidding.</v>

354
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a before and after of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really quite brutal.</v>

355
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she used to look like.</v>

356
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>But that's like as she was getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

357
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.960
<v Speaker 1>that was before she really hit it hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go ahead and find it.</v>

358
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where was,</v>

359
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I was on a part of the money but she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy.</v>

360
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about good looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how like how valuable that is.</v>

361
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if you're a woman and your </v>

362
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.170
<v Speaker 1>entire self worth is derived off your </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks,</v>

363
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 1>which is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds sad.</v>

364
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

365
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>what do we put it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexist fucking things that say men.</v>

366
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Women don't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

367
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 1>let's be realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men think like that.</v>

368
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 1>There's some men that think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There she is.</v>

369
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.730
<v Speaker 1>There's some men that think like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some good.</v>

370
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that are fucking </v>

371
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.061
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do have that Willy Wonka golden </v>

372
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:04.421
<v Speaker 1>ticket and a lot of times it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>being born that way just to roll the </v>

373
00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:07.901
<v Speaker 1>dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you got that lottery ticket and </v>

374
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:07.901
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it slip away for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

375
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

376
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 1>very tough pill to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gotta read some Alan Watts slipping</v>

377
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:16.250
<v Speaker 1>away for everybody and we're all kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a continuous thing.</v>

378
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they see these young girls is </v>

379
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 1>20 year old girl laughing and giggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cube bitch,</v>

380
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>just angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

381
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's more envy between </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and there is between men because </v>

382
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.510
<v Speaker 1>guys don't have a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have like generational envy </v>

383
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.400
<v Speaker 1>adult really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

384
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I definitely think.</v>

385
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think there's zero value in</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering who's got it worse.</v>

386
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Men Or women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

387
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think it's worse for a man to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel jealous or a woman to feel Joe's?</v>

388
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely not worrying.</v>

389
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Worth worrying about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

390
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Worse in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the men.</v>

391
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the men woman thing is way safer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a guy in some respects.</v>

392
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about women,</v>

393
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to worry about men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

394
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits to both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>

395
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

396
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>it's really entirely who you are and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it.</v>

397
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:13.821
<v Speaker 1>There's women who you talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing they would ever want to </v>

398
00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 1>do is be a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

399
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are morons.</v>

400
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be one of these apes just </v>
<v Speaker 1>running around trying to stick my tube </v>

401
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 1>steak into people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And shoot Goo all the time and I'm lying</v>

402
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:29.631
<v Speaker 1>to them constantly to try to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position pulleys and blind and myself </v>

403
00:18:29.631 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>about who I am to appeal more sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

404
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You see New Jersey is considering a bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make it or it would make it.</v>

405
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.840
<v Speaker 1>It would make it sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Form of sexual assault to lie about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much money you make,</v>

407
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just lie about money lie about </v>

408
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

409
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that using deception in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get sex,</v>

411
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that you're a liar and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you frauded someone.</v>

412
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 1>But man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So then if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're,</v>

414
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>we're putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making sex like a value.</v>

415
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making sex.</v>

416
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:08.211
<v Speaker 1>Like by saying that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially condoning a form of </v>

417
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:13.281
<v Speaker 1>prostitution because if that's the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>then is it a felony or whatever the fuck</v>

418
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>type of charge they're calling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of charge are they calling it?</v>

419
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 1>What fence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever level of fences.</v>

420
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Why is it not a felony or a crime of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar order?</v>

421
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>If I decide to lie to you to become your</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and make you give me a massage.</v>

422
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

423
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:37.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's not because then you know you </v>

424
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 1>weren't sexually assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea of sex and the idea.</v>

425
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 1>This person was absolutely willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex with that person,</v>

426
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 1>but only because that person didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly tell the truth.</v>

427
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

428
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 1>if you get like friends with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them stay over your house and here,</v>

429
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.760
<v Speaker 1>here man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrow my car because you think the guy </v>

430
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.711
<v Speaker 1>has a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out he's totally fucking broke </v>

431
00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and a con artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a felony?</v>

432
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if he goes to court and your </v>

433
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy let me borrow his car.</v>

434
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Siemen let him borrow your car.</v>

435
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was the Duke of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Duchess of whatever.</v>

436
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.680
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

437
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Let him borrow my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

438
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you should have checked on that case to </v>
<v Speaker 1>semest.</v>

439
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get fucked,</v>

440
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>if you let that guy fuck your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to go,</v>

441
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got rapes on you guys.</v>

442
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You got the bad end of the stick for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

443
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>The shorter end of the stick a maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

444
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people shouldn't lie,</v>

445
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you can make laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

446
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.300
<v Speaker 1>so it's such a slippery slope because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy is dressed well,</v>

447
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>a night club on a Saturday night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a nice watch on,</v>

448
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>is he not misrepresenting himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that sexual assault?</v>

449
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 1>If he takes the girl back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah know I guess he's supposed to dress</v>

450
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:51.111
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking garbage man outfit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his income level or can you </v>

451
00:20:51.111 --> 00:20:54.961
<v Speaker 1>actually look good on a weekend and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like playing a little thought </v>

452
00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:55.250
<v Speaker 1>experiment here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because that's,</v>

453
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very valid point.</v>

454
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It does seem like a slippery slope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

455
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very valid point.</v>

456
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 1>How about if someone with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit watch on.</v>

457
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a big thing with some </v>

458
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.511
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buy fake watches up and down Canal </v>

459
00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Street rolodex rollback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the place.</v>

460
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're pretty good like some of the</v>

461
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:18.181
<v Speaker 1>copies because now they have computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can scan like it used to be when if</v>

462
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you bought like a fake rolex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had to hire someone to create the </v>

463
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 1>plans and have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just three d print that shit.</v>

464
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 99 point nine percent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

465
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they can.</v>

466
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.640
<v Speaker 1>The good ones actually take a rolex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally copy every piece of it.</v>

467
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power efficient.</v>

468
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

469
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean half of them probably break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who the fuck knows what kind of </v>

470
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>quality control they have.</v>

471
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>But if you're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know any better,</v>

472
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rolex.</v>

473
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a $5,000</v>

474
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile no lives with.</v>

475
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:55.510
<v Speaker 1>His mom bought the watch for 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought it on craigslist with bitcoin.</v>

476
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he a fraud as he should he go to jail</v>

477
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 1>for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>

478
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 1>He's only a fraud to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the big things about</v>

479
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 1>an expensive waste of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this,</v>

480
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you can look down and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I earned this.</v>

481
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you're looking down at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like reasserts that you're full of </v>

482
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what do you like?</v>

483
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 1>What kind of energy are you putting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

484
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:20.551
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing that I'd rather </v>

485
00:22:20.551 --> 00:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>pay $100 for a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually like a real fossil or </v>

486
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>real time Max.</v>

488
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Then a fake rolex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fake rolex.</v>

489
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It looks exactly like a rolex and worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

490
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.190
<v Speaker 1>The sound like a fake Ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you get a fake Ferrari on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking thing's terrible.</v>

492
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a watch.</v>

493
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't do a lot.</v>

494
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Just tells you what fucking time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

495
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>the reality is those mechanical watches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're beautiful and everything like </v>

496
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool.</v>

497
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea behind it that like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>craftsman takes this watch and </v>

498
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 1>constructs it and all the wheels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gears and everything are all sinked up.</v>

499
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:59.581
<v Speaker 1>I think that's absolutely fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of those fucking quartz watches </v>

500
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 1>works way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those courts power watches,</v>

501
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:07.681
<v Speaker 1>those fucking things are never wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There they stay like their time stays </v>

502
00:23:07.681 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>perfect forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have expensive rolex that the UFC gave</v>

503
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 1>me a watch that I would buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a beautiful watch and that </v>

504
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>fucker's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every two months I got to like back</v>

505
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>it up five minutes and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating.</v>

506
00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like every two months it's five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes fast.</v>

507
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.220
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars for this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

509
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's old technology.</v>

510
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.130
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a fetish for,</v>

511
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>for rich men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

512
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:37.591
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like this watch doesn't cost </v>

513
00:23:37.591 --> 00:23:37.591
<v Speaker 1>much and it glows in the dark and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go under water with it.</v>

514
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It's never wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

516
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get tired and then when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

517
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fucking two year lifespan</v>

518
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 4>on the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put a new battery in your good.</v>

519
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Well not 30 years with the Apple Watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out.</v>

520
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Anyone who doesn't have an apple watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be by default,</v>

521
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 4>a hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'll be like,</v>

522
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

523
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 4>You're old fashioned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the vintage watch on.</v>

524
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

525
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too problematic.</v>

526
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a bunch of problems with the watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

527
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 4>no one wants to fucking be completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to your shit all the time like</v>

528
00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:16.751
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing about having a phone but </v>

529
00:24:16.751 --> 00:24:19.121
<v Speaker 4>constantly staring at your watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your Dick Tracy and getting text </v>

530
00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 4>messages on your watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit's stupid.</v>

531
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Especially because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have your phone as well.</v>

532
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Like you already have your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you.</v>

533
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why you want to look at your watch and </v>

534
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 4>get the weather.</v>

535
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 4>So on your fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

536
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 4>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need it to be on everything.</v>

537
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.460
<v Speaker 4>How about you put it across your Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like a big neon sign in your </v>

538
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:36.460
<v Speaker 4>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you peek and get the weather,</v>

539
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 4>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're getting ridiculous.</v>

540
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Like how many more things do we need?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

541
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize you needed to have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone on you.</v>

542
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 4>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it a little less cool.</v>

543
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you can use it without the </v>

544
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.311
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't have cellular </v>

545
00:24:51.311 --> 00:24:52.901
<v Speaker 4>functionality it might have for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cellular function because I mean maybe </v>

546
00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:55.550
<v Speaker 4>it's just like an appendage for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone.</v>

547
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 4>We don't really need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

548
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's essentially a small little </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer on its own.</v>

549
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 4>It carries mp3s.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do a lot of things with it.</v>

550
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It does work as a watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

551
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:07.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if you load the weather and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff up on it,</v>

552
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 4>it probably stays on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure it syncs up to your </v>

553
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 4>watch this last week.</v>

554
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 4>This bracelet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a concept,</v>

555
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 4>but supposedly they show it working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you the video.</v>

556
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 4>This brace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

557
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:22.961
<v Speaker 4>They're showing two things here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this bracelet as well I was talking </v>

558
00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:25.331
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a video playing out of a </v>

559
00:25:25.331 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 4>bracelet on your wrist and at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>working iphone or screen touchscreen.</v>

560
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do it underwater.</v>

561
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

562
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're getting too crazy.</v>

563
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 4>But it's also a concept to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're asking for money.</v>

564
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 4>They said they needed like a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars to get it working.</v>

565
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Somebody better check the tech on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you had to pumping dump.</v>

566
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:47.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not invested in money in anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not already there looking cool.</v>

567
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be just give us a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

568
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get that.</v>

569
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.850
<v Speaker 4>People I'm going to get involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground floor and no,</v>

570
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.390
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the case with,</v>

571
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with bitcoin and all coins really,</v>

572
00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 4>like there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aside from Bitcoin,</v>

573
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:04.931
<v Speaker 4>there are thousands of other coins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they suck people in because it's one of </v>

574
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.820
<v Speaker 4>those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

575
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind goes,</v>

576
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 4>this could be the next bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but statistically it's not going to be,</v>

577
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 4>but it could be.</v>

578
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.720
<v Speaker 4>And so you put money into it and most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things turned out to be bullshit.</v>

579
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:19.970
<v Speaker 4>But there are a couple that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>promising so.</v>

580
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was funny talking to Andreas </v>

581
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 4>Antonopoulos yesterday who's a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking interesting dude.</v>

582
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:29.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad we have him on our side,</v>

583
00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Speaker 4>the human race since,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he would be really dangerous in </v>

584
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 4>the hands of the military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>industrial nsa type side of things.</v>

585
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

586
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they have guys like him that </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of intelligence,</v>

587
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:45.191
<v Speaker 4>but when he was talking about Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that he was talking </v>

588
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:45.191
<v Speaker 4>about was how</v>

589
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 5>it's important to recognize that this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>not something that you're going to do </v>

590
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.020
<v Speaker 5>and get rich off of like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're getting involved in this.</v>

591
00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:56.021
<v Speaker 5>You get involved in this because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in it and that's essentially </v>

592
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:56.021
<v Speaker 5>what's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he likes that.</v>

593
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the,</v>

594
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:01.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are investing all their </v>

595
00:27:01.731 --> 00:27:03.501
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very likely you're gonna lose your </v>

596
00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:03.501
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on long run,</v>

597
00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:05.180
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand it's also likely or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not likely,</v>

598
00:27:05.181 --> 00:27:10.181
<v Speaker 3>it's possible you can make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>astronomical amount because I'm Peter </v>

599
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:16.330
<v Speaker 3>diamandis talks about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a youtube lecture people can </v>

600
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.401
<v Speaker 3>look up called exponential thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who started the x prize </v>

601
00:27:18.401 --> 00:27:22.571
<v Speaker 3>foundation and I realized that part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is probably just he wants to give </v>

602
00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:25.831
<v Speaker 3>really bad ass lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that what he's saying is </v>

603
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:28.211
<v Speaker 3>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's that once you get any </v>

604
00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:28.211
<v Speaker 3>technology and make it completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital,</v>

605
00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:33.160
<v Speaker 3>it has to follow Moore's law to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent where you get that doubling of </v>

606
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.671
<v Speaker 3>sophistication every year to 18 months </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

607
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.590
<v Speaker 3>if you kind of ignore the price itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been happening with Bitcoin,</v>

608
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.740
<v Speaker 3>like the sophistication of it is roughly</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubling every year in terms of services</v>

609
00:27:45.741 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 3>offered on top of it and things you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with it.</v>

610
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.860
<v Speaker 3>And if you follow that out to its </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical extreme,</v>

611
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it eventually has to be worth a lot more</v>

612
00:27:55.011 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 3>than it's worth now because nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really using it.</v>

613
00:27:57.111 --> 00:28:02.111
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a couple million people using </v>

614
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:02.111
<v Speaker 3>it that's less than one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

615
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:03.590
<v Speaker 3>less than one percent of financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>transactions.</v>

616
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.990
<v Speaker 3>If you get up to maybe like five or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

617
00:28:05.991 --> 00:28:09.260
<v Speaker 3>which is totally reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that number has to be much,</v>

618
00:28:09.261 --> 00:28:09.950
<v Speaker 3>much larger.</v>

619
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:15.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For 10 percent sign out of the realm of </v>

620
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.461
<v Speaker 5>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you consider they're </v>

621
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:17.461
<v Speaker 5>starting to use it on paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

622
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:18.640
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you can use it on paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>

623
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty easy.</v>

624
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.930
<v Speaker 5>If I could just go with bitcoin instead </v>
<v Speaker 5>of dollars and you could start,</v>

625
00:28:22.931 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he set up a bitcoin account connected to</v>

626
00:28:25.331 --> 00:28:26.890
<v Speaker 5>your paper towels are buying things.</v>

627
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing was some of the remaining </v>

628
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>critics and the media of Bitcoin were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

629
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great technology,</v>

630
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's not there yet because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready for the masses.</v>

631
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 3>And increasingly that's no longer a </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid argument because there are a few </v>

632
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 3>companies that have built stuff on top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Bitcoin,</v>

633
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of what people had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying would happen.</v>

634
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these services are so mainstream </v>

635
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.020
<v Speaker 3>friendly that you take one look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

636
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

637
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Like the change tip thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

638
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I had been doing stuff with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like playing with their tipping thing.</v>

639
00:28:57.461 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been getting a lot.</v>

640
00:28:58.441 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've been ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

641
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:04.461
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually real money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are sending you and somebody </v>

642
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:04.461
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

643
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:04.461
<v Speaker 3>great podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a coffee.</v>

644
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 3>How do you know where it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes on your twitter.</v>

645
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

646
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.860
<v Speaker 3>they're very smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It integrates with your twitter account </v>

647
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.501
<v Speaker 3>or your reddit account or google plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like a just masses friendly I </v>

648
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 3>can say to you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

649
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:22.551
<v Speaker 3>enjoy the video yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a beer and it sends you like $3 </v>

650
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:24.150
<v Speaker 3>worth of Bitcoin does all the shit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the back end.</v>

651
00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:29.151
<v Speaker 3>So all you need to know is what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter password is and you can collect </v>

652
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:29.151
<v Speaker 3>your money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

653
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 3>but what if you don't have an account?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you have a twitter account,</v>

654
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 3>they'll like allow you to log in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>collected.</v>

655
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how bizarre.</v>

656
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It's really well done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cool idea to a bunch of those.</v>

657
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Well I didn't know what they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

658
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Just like ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

659
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are</v>

660
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.610
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like phishing attempt.</v>

661
00:29:43.611 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 1>So those are strangers sending you money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they like your podcast,</v>

662
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:49.550
<v Speaker 1>which right now is still probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>a very small percentage of listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about when everybody has one of</v>

664
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>these things in their wallets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever they hear a podcast they like,</v>

665
00:29:55.271 --> 00:30:00.271
<v Speaker 1>they can just spontaneously send you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifty cents like that multiplied by a </v>

666
00:30:00.271 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 1>thousand people or 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

667
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 1>You can tell advertisers to get fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of years.</v>

668
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

669
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But you run into the risk of running </v>
<v Speaker 1>into people that.</v>

670
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I like about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the podcast is free.</v>

671
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So like when if people complain or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something they don't like or </v>

672
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.470
<v Speaker 1>something they want different price was </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

673
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's do this is how I'm doing it.</v>

674
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear it.</v>

675
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 1>You should just try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you make it an hour?</v>

676
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

677
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

678
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like it,</v>

679
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're paying for it,</v>

680
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:34.960
<v Speaker 1>then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be much more likely in that.</v>

681
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like selecting out the random </v>

682
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 1>problem people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like most people,</v>

683
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you allow them to buy you a drink and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's cool,</v>

684
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's that rare person,</v>

685
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Vegas recently and this guy </v>

686
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't even bias drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting with my friend Justin,</v>

687
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 1>and it was after UFC we're just catching</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

688
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>having a couple drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting the shit.</v>

689
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 1>There's this fucking guy and his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were hammered next to us.</v>

690
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:01.960
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't leave us alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wouldn't,</v>

691
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>just wouldn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was just dumb.</v>

692
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.601
<v Speaker 1>He kept interrupting with the questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was annoying everyone around </v>

693
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:09.601
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

694
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And then finally the dude chimes in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

695
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just trying to have a </v>

697
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:18.510
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

698
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep talking to you about this,</v>

699
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep interrupting in the middle of </v>

700
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>everybody talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

701
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.891
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought you a fucking drink that </v>

702
00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:28.421
<v Speaker 1>somebody who needs an express hit of lsd</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something so they can see like just </v>

703
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:29.350
<v Speaker 1>the little tiny picture of what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole they're being.</v>

704
00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And then when he was just an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just really dumb.</v>

705
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 1>But he won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

706
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>he didn't buy me a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

707
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

708
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

709
00:31:35.921 --> 00:31:40.921
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not drinking so you haven't bought </v>

710
00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:42.140
<v Speaker 1>me a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my friend Justin paid the tab tab,</v>

711
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>the thing he was lording over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even do,</v>

712
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but in his mind he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably bought drinks for people </v>

713
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.741
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he decided this is where I was </v>

735
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.350
<v Speaker 5>with shitty singing,</v>

736
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 3>the Revolution of affordable yogurt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh fruits,</v>

737
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 3>vintages,</v>

738
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:07.630
<v Speaker 5>doing nothing but making a lot of energy</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sound by doing it.</v>

739
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:13.110
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that you're upset about police </v>

740
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.511
<v Speaker 5>brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that you're upset about the way </v>

741
00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:15.511
<v Speaker 5>this country is going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get the.</v>

742
00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:19.140
<v Speaker 5>But going through trader Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clapping your hands is in fixing a </v>

743
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.741
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing because just going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>alienate people to whatever dumb idea </v>

744
00:33:22.741 --> 00:33:22.741
<v Speaker 5>you have.</v>

745
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

746
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 3>there was a woman in Venice beach who </v>
<v Speaker 3>came up to me recently and asked me to </v>

747
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.060
<v Speaker 3>sign our petition to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to run.</v>

748
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

749
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

750
00:33:31.681 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 3>don't you maybe you want to start with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a youtube channel or something.</v>

751
00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you?</v>

752
00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:37.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just leap right to president.</v>

753
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And she had a few signatures and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>so serious about it and I was like,</v>

754
00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:41.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the platform?</v>

755
00:33:41.971 --> 00:33:44.010
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to eliminate homelessness in</v>

756
00:33:44.011 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Venice beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking like,</v>

757
00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:47.640
<v Speaker 3>that's not really a national platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

758
00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:48.740
<v Speaker 3>you're going to become president and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

759
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.480
<v Speaker 3>we have to address the five homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>people right here.</v>

760
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

761
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.510
<v Speaker 3>my point though is I think that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that they have to change something</v>

762
00:33:57.511 --> 00:34:02.511
<v Speaker 3>and they have to do something because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can see all the problems around </v>

763
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:02.640
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for some people that's,</v>

764
00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:06.000
<v Speaker 3>let's go to a protest or let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's run for office or let's,</v>

765
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just start a petition.</v>

766
00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:11.970
<v Speaker 3>No matter how ridiculous it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sad reality is,</v>

767
00:34:11.971 --> 00:34:16.971
<v Speaker 3>revolution is silent nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the people who are online buying </v>

768
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:21.171
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin and developing these other coins</v>
<v Speaker 3>are creating more of a revolution than </v>

769
00:34:21.841 --> 00:34:23.580
<v Speaker 3>anybody in the trader Joe's on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday.</v>

770
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what they're trying to do is </v>

771
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 5>raise awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess what,</v>

772
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.650
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck isn't aware?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this ferguson ruling went down to </v>

773
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.500
<v Speaker 5>this riots and Missouri who's unaware </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't,</v>

774
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:37.740
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to walk through Pasadena </v>
<v Speaker 5>yelling at people.</v>

775
00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:39.150
<v Speaker 5>Like those people were aware.</v>

776
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Well I was tweeting out stuff about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

777
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do black people distrust law </v>

778
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.220
<v Speaker 3>enforcement so much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just this one case like some of</v>

779
00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:53.221
<v Speaker 3>the people on Fox News or making it seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is happening in a vacuum and </v>

780
00:34:53.221 --> 00:34:57.031
<v Speaker 3>it's that black people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against when you look at </v>

781
00:34:57.031 --> 00:34:57.760
<v Speaker 3>the percentages of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of drug charges and stuff,</v>

782
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.020
<v Speaker 3>even after decriminalization occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>states like Massachusetts,</v>

783
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.380
<v Speaker 3>blacks continue to get arrested at </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately high rates.</v>

784
00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:10.381
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some kind of racism happening </v>

785
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:10.381
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

786
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:10.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>

787
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:13.090
<v Speaker 5>there's two things for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's racism definitely.</v>

788
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.210
<v Speaker 5>And definitely it makes it more </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult for cops.</v>

789
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are dealing with like say if </v>

790
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.351
<v Speaker 5>you're a good cop and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a community that's </v>

791
00:35:25.351 --> 00:35:28.981
<v Speaker 5>been totally ostracized because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>been a bunch of cops that came before </v>

792
00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:32.611
<v Speaker 5>you that profile a black people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>pick them out to harass them,</v>

793
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.480
<v Speaker 3>forcing a couple of laws that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't exist anymore.</v>

794
00:35:36.481 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Like it's weird me that here in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>great God fearing state of California,</v>

795
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I can smoke weed and I consider it to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>an antidepressant for me.</v>

796
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 3>And I do it legally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

797
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm a law abiding citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the medical marijuana card.</v>

798
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 3>You just go a couple hours away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly you're like cool hand Luke,</v>

799
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the same exact thing.</v>

800
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:59.901
<v Speaker 3>Like now you're on the wrong side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>law and that's the case in half the </v>

801
00:35:59.901 --> 00:35:59.901
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have this weird limbo thing.</v>

802
00:35:59.901 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 3>We're half the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have it half don't.</v>

803
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean just the marijuana?</v>

804
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the marijuana.</v>

805
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:08.511
<v Speaker 3>And like as like a white journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm probably not going to be the </v>

806
00:36:08.511 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 3>one who's singled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a dis,</v>

807
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

808
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.830
<v Speaker 3>like any kind of disadvantaged minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your chances of being busted for </v>

809
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.700
<v Speaker 3>something like that is way higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the cost,</v>

810
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 3>just the cost to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

811
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.130
<v Speaker 3>your career and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can take years to get that off your </v>

812
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.581
<v Speaker 3>record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a real thing that is somewhat </v>

813
00:36:28.581 --> 00:36:29.340
<v Speaker 3>a happening along racial lines.</v>

814
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the fucking see about this.</v>

815
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

816
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.410
<v Speaker 5>that's a minor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

817
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.980
<v Speaker 5>that's a least like a physical thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can,</v>

818
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.880
<v Speaker 5>you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

819
00:36:39.881 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 5>it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's marijuana.</v>

820
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.280
<v Speaker 5>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

821
00:36:42.281 --> 00:36:45.400
<v Speaker 5>they're getting arrested for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear about this fucking guy that</v>

822
00:36:45.401 --> 00:36:50.401
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cops stopped the man for walking </v>

823
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:50.401
<v Speaker 5>with his hands in his pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

824
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:55.630
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a guy in Michigan who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing nothing wrong and they both pull </v>

825
00:36:57.671 --> 00:37:00.700
<v Speaker 5>out their cell phones and they film each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

826
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:05.850
<v Speaker 5>So there's a two phones standoff between</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cop and the guy and it's the most </v>

827
00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:08.920
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

828
00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:10.840
<v Speaker 5>this fucking guy just has his hands in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his pocket.</v>

829
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a black guy who happens to </v>

830
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.121
<v Speaker 5>have his hands in his pockets and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cop starts questioning him and the guy </v>

831
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:18.460
<v Speaker 5>pulls his phone out of the cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulls his phone out.</v>

832
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.080
<v Speaker 5>They're both recording each other at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>

833
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:21.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>

834
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:23.140
<v Speaker 5>That guy's not doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let him go.</v>

835
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not doing shit.</v>

836
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's walking with his hands in his </v>

837
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 5>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He pulled out his phone.</v>

838
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 5>He's filming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're filming him.</v>

839
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.220
<v Speaker 5>You're wasting my fucking money and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going crazy seeing this,</v>

840
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.090
<v Speaker 5>so please let that fucking guy walk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not committing any crimes,</v>

841
00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:38.770
<v Speaker 5>but walking was fucking hands in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>pocket.</v>

842
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere you look might be doing </v>

843
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 5>something that you can't see that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal.</v>

844
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.290
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean you get to knock on </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's fucking door and going,</v>

845
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.400
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even see inside your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing in there?</v>

846
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to do that Douche bag and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when a guy's walking down the street </v>

847
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.461
<v Speaker 5>with his hands in his pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might as well be alone in his home </v>

848
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:57.790
<v Speaker 5>until you see something actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>suspicious,</v>

849
00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.940
<v Speaker 5>like he's reaching into his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's pulling out a fucking gun out </v>

850
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.050
<v Speaker 5>of his inside of his jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't see that,</v>

851
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.280
<v Speaker 5>then shut the fuck up because you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen a guy walking and you're allowed to</v>

852
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:10.810
<v Speaker 5>put your hands in your pocket to stay </v>
<v Speaker 5>warm.</v>

853
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.990
<v Speaker 5>Don't have to like walk everywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 5>our hands up.</v>

854
00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.700
<v Speaker 5>Is that our new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>David Seaman?</v>

855
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.820
<v Speaker 5>We have to walk with her fingers moving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we know that there's no razor blades </v>

856
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:20.820
<v Speaker 5>in between them.</v>

857
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.000
<v Speaker 3>We most certainly do not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

858
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:27.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real issue where I think that </v>

859
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people or status in the same </v>

860
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 3>way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

861
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 3>the few hundred years ago people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>really a blindly adherent to the church,</v>

862
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:40.681
<v Speaker 3>said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if the church says something </v>

863
00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:40.681
<v Speaker 3>completely ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the church said,</v>

864
00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:44.281
<v Speaker 3>Galileo is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to keep them under house </v>

865
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 3>arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And today the state,</v>

866
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.770
<v Speaker 3>this similarly kind of opaque </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization says Julian Assange is </v>

867
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.541
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to keep him under house arrest </v>

868
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 3>in his thing and that embassy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda the same thing,</v>

869
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:59.851
<v Speaker 3>like you have somebody who's just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought criminal saying things that you </v>

870
00:38:59.851 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 3>don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are actually some extent,</v>

871
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:05.191
<v Speaker 3>completely fucking true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the case of Galileo in the </v>

872
00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:05.580
<v Speaker 3>case of some of the surveillance stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

873
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.720
<v Speaker 3>so how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

874
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
<v Speaker 3>how different is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have people ruining lives over </v>

875
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.421
<v Speaker 3>marijuana possession in a state like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Missouri that's a little behind the </v>

876
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 3>times in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>

877
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:16.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

878
00:39:16.311 --> 00:39:21.311
<v Speaker 3>what gives you this right to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like an agent of the church </v>

879
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:22.150
<v Speaker 3>ruining people's lives over accusations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of witchcraft.</v>

880
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It's similarly nonscientific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

881
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:26.740
<v Speaker 3>there's no scientific basis for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

882
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 3>There's no public safety basis.</v>

883
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think once,</v>

884
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.670
<v Speaker 5>once the time has gone and passed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's been enough space to reflect,</v>

885
00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:37.160
<v Speaker 5>people are going to look back of </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana legalization.</v>

886
00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:42.161
<v Speaker 5>Very similar to the way they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>like putting people in jail for being a </v>

887
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:42.161
<v Speaker 5>witch.</v>

888
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

889
00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I think every age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every age has some kind of evil that for</v>

890
00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:50.591
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people living through it just don't </v>

891
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:52.631
<v Speaker 3>really see how big a deal it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that one before was segregation and </v>

892
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:54.800
<v Speaker 3>now I believe it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

893
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.400
<v Speaker 3>prohibition and not just of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic prohibition.</v>

894
00:39:58.401 --> 00:40:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Like why are these little companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing with Bitcoin,</v>

895
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 3>concerned about the government going </v>
<v Speaker 3>after them for money laundering and </v>

896
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous,</v>

897
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're trying to play with these </v>

898
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:12.461
<v Speaker 3>laws that were designed 40 years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technologies are totally different </v>

899
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:12.820
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

900
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that prohibition does </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar to censorship,</v>

901
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:20.730
<v Speaker 5>that's insidious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the more insidious aspects of it </v>

902
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.390
<v Speaker 5>is not just that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

903
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a difference,</v>

904
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 5>a differing opinion as to what should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and should not be acceptable behavior,</v>

905
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 5>whether it's saying certain words or </v>
<v Speaker 5>using certain drugs.</v>

906
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:37.590
<v Speaker 5>But it becomes a thing where another </v>
<v Speaker 5>person has control over you and it's </v>

907
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 5>preventing you from doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to do.</v>

908
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 5>And when people prevent people from </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing things they want to do,</v>

909
00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 5>it builds up resentment and it causes </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>

910
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 5>And it fucks up a lot of harmonious </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships.</v>

911
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.640
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of one person having ultimate power</v>

912
00:40:56.711 --> 00:41:01.711
<v Speaker 5>over you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially for something like marijuana </v>

913
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:01.711
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

914
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:03.040
<v Speaker 5>saying certain words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go to court,</v>

915
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in court and you know,</v>

916
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 5>the guy passes some sort of a ruling on </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and you're like,</v>

917
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your honor.</v>

918
00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:14.041
<v Speaker 5>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can throw you in jail for longer </v>

919
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 5>because you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

920
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 5>your honor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just some guy.</v>

921
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:17.930
<v Speaker 5>Contempt of court.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

922
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Some guy who by the way it's been proven</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

923
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.180
<v Speaker 5>Just people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

924
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not like this is like a hood that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the judges.</v>

925
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

926
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.240
<v Speaker 5>everyone's a fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've just got people there and you </v>

927
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 5>so can't say fuck</v>

928
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 4>you to that guy if he does something </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably wrong.</v>

929
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:42.130
<v Speaker 4>And meanwhile has been proven in </v>
<v Speaker 4>countless cases of judges being arrested</v>

930
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 4>for fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judges being arrested for corruption,</v>

931
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 4>masturbating in robes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing in Pennsylvania was pretty bad.</v>

932
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 4>He was sending all these kids to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid corrections facility.</v>

933
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.790
<v Speaker 4>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was getting paid.</v>

934
00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was getting paid to do that.</v>

935
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 4>And he's in jail now for like 35 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not enough.</v>

936
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.920
<v Speaker 4>That's like a dickens novel that's awful</v>
<v Speaker 4>to treat kids like that and just taking </v>

937
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.911
<v Speaker 4>kids away from their parents and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>them locked up and he was profiting off </v>

938
00:42:06.911 --> 00:42:08.460
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deal where they would pay him that.</v>

939
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 4>That's a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the judge.</v>

940
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:15.581
<v Speaker 4>It's a person that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all comes back to the drug war and </v>

941
00:42:15.581 --> 00:42:18.170
<v Speaker 4>prohibition because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of stuff is just too complicated.</v>

942
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:21.410
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that it's purely good or </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil and it's gray areas.</v>

943
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 4>But as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the private prison industry,</v>

944
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 4>which is a real thing is as close to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pure evil as you can get.</v>

945
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 4>You have people who are using all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tools of capitalism which are </v>

946
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.130
<v Speaker 4>significant tools and they're using it </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to,</v>

947
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build us a better phone next year or to </v>

948
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 4>cure some new kinds of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're using it to keep people in cages</v>

949
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:45.791
<v Speaker 4>for exploring their own minds and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trafficking and things that are just </v>

950
00:42:45.791 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 4>natural herbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

951
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

952
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 4>it's close to evil as you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

953
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a machine that</v>

954
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.440
<v Speaker 5>when have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you got a big business like that,</v>

955
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.440
<v Speaker 5>whether you're a big business is Walmart</v>
<v Speaker 5>or target,</v>

956
00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:01.770
<v Speaker 5>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get in trouble for trying to </v>

957
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.190
<v Speaker 5>change regulations and laws in order to </v>
<v Speaker 5>allow them to make more money in certain</v>

958
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 5>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that might not be legal right now.</v>

959
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.220
<v Speaker 5>People look at them like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

960
00:43:09.221 --> 00:43:10.270
<v Speaker 5>they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

961
00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:12.250
<v Speaker 5>they're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just trying to stay alive.</v>

962
00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:14.950
<v Speaker 5>There are machine and the machine that </v>
<v Speaker 5>generates money.</v>

963
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.660
<v Speaker 5>When you get a million people involved </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that machine and you,</v>

964
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:23.661
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you essentially have a million pieces </v>

965
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:27.390
<v Speaker 5>and these pieces run this organism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this organism call it target or call it </v>

966
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.940
<v Speaker 5>a name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any one of them.</v>

967
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:36.150
<v Speaker 5>Once they become a machine there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to continue to extract money </v>

968
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.620
<v Speaker 5>in any way they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once they have that process going,</v>

969
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.800
<v Speaker 5>they want to continue and if it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>means arresting more people and locking </v>

970
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.701
<v Speaker 5>them up in their houses because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house make money every for every person </v>

971
00:43:47.701 --> 00:43:47.701
<v Speaker 5>in that house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get x amount of dollars a year.</v>

972
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.270
<v Speaker 5>The more people you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more money we get.</v>

973
00:43:49.271 --> 00:43:54.271
<v Speaker 5>The more laws on the books and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>people will get to the more laws that </v>

974
00:43:54.271 --> 00:43:54.400
<v Speaker 5>were on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more money we'll will our,</v>

975
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 5>our organism will get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And every one of these corporations,</v>

976
00:43:58.331 --> 00:44:00.250
<v Speaker 5>every one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's fucking,</v>

977
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.090
<v Speaker 5>whether it's target or whether it's fill</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the blank,</v>

978
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>starbucks,</v>

979
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 5>they all want to grow every year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to grow,</v>

980
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.370
<v Speaker 5>they want to get bigger and bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger.</v>

981
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:11.320
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to taper off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

982
00:44:11.321 --> 00:44:13.150
<v Speaker 5>we've been doing good for about 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

983
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my house is pretty much paid off.</v>

984
00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 5>Like let's just taper off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need more money.</v>

985
00:44:18.821 --> 00:44:20.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't need a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on man.</v>

986
00:44:20.081 --> 00:44:22.600
<v Speaker 5>If I had a boat out of a fixed the boat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and cleaned the boat,</v>

987
00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:24.040
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody does that.</v>

988
00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:29.430
<v Speaker 5>So when you deal with a company like </v>
<v Speaker 5>target or you deal with a company like a</v>

989
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 5>Bob's prisons or whatever the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing.</v>

990
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:34.970
<v Speaker 5>You're allowing someone to make money </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

991
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

992
00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I think you nailed the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>

993
00:44:37.451 --> 00:44:42.451
<v Speaker 3>which is these institutions are there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract money and if we can get a better</v>

994
00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:46.350
<v Speaker 3>form of money then even though we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>still gonna,</v>

995
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:51.370
<v Speaker 3>have people doing human things which </v>
<v Speaker 3>involves making as much money as </v>

996
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:54.901
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're actually using more fair </v>

997
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:57.421
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we can track that flow and it can </v>

998
00:44:57.421 --> 00:45:00.001
<v Speaker 3>be done in a more fair way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm pretty convinced that a lot of </v>

999
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:03.241
<v Speaker 3>the shit we see in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>militarization and all the military </v>

1000
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:07.081
<v Speaker 3>industrial complex and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of the way our financial </v>

1001
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:11.851
<v Speaker 3>system works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have the government to go back </v>

1002
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:13.600
<v Speaker 3>to comparing government to the church </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a few hundred years ago.</v>

1003
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 3>He had this organization that is beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>the average person's understanding and </v>

1004
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.581
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones in charge of money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very unscientific and it's kind of </v>

1005
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:23.581
<v Speaker 3>mysterious.</v>

1006
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:28.440
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like that money always </v>
<v Speaker 3>loops back around and goes to these </v>

1007
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 3>kinds of organizations like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1008
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1009
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:35.650
<v Speaker 3>companies that lobby for prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>contracts and not to the individual.</v>

1010
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1011
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.530
<v Speaker 3>there's an intrinsic problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1012
00:45:38.531 --> 00:45:41.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on what I've researched,</v>

1013
00:45:41.231 --> 00:45:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I really think that this whole currency </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution is going to fix a lot of that</v>

1014
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.120
<v Speaker 3>so we're still going to have shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

1015
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:51.121
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be a lot harder in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years to be a Booz Allen Hamilton or a,</v>

1016
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.970
<v Speaker 3>a Lockheed Martin or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do the creepy stuff.</v>

1017
00:45:54.971 --> 00:45:56.590
<v Speaker 3>You'll still be able to do the good </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1018
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.730
<v Speaker 3>but the creepier sides are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>just really hard to justify because that</v>

1019
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:02.590
<v Speaker 3>money is going to have to come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

1020
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Like in the same way that those tipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>services are taking off a.</v>

1021
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.330
<v Speaker 3>every citizen is going to have some say </v>
<v Speaker 3>over where their money actually goes.</v>

1022
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.460
<v Speaker 3>And that sounds like it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>futuristic still.</v>

1023
00:46:12.461 --> 00:46:17.461
<v Speaker 3>But it's going to happen I think faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than people realize because it's </v>

1024
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:17.461
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1025
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's the case,</v>

1026
00:46:18.411 --> 00:46:22.250
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be a weird world to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies,</v>

1027
00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:26.330
<v Speaker 5>corporations become accountable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>started having to address and adjust.</v>

1028
00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.590
<v Speaker 5>And if you force them to be accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're essentially comprised at people.</v>

1029
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.330
<v Speaker 5>If the people at the top end of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spectrum or not just being forced to act</v>

1030
00:46:35.331 --> 00:46:40.331
<v Speaker 5>ethically but are encouraged to and are </v>
<v Speaker 5>empowered by doing so,</v>

1031
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 5>like they get to feel good about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that look,</v>

1032
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.180
<v Speaker 5>everybody can make a living and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>raped the world.</v>

1033
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:50.390
<v Speaker 5>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just the idea that capitalism has</v>

1034
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:53.180
<v Speaker 5>to be this monster that doesn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck about anything but money.</v>

1035
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:58.130
<v Speaker 5>That's only because we've allowed it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be that we haven't liked strained it,</v>

1036
00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:03.220
<v Speaker 5>constrained it with ethics and morals </v>
<v Speaker 5>and essentially that's the case with </v>

1037
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.060
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Psychopaths come from.</v>

1038
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:07.640
<v Speaker 5>When you think murderers and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>warlords come from.</v>

1039
00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:09.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but hold on.</v>

1040
00:47:09.441 --> 00:47:11.810
<v Speaker 5>That's a human being that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 5>constrained,</v>

1041
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.220
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what it is.</v>

1042
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a human being that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1043
00:47:15.141 --> 00:47:20.141
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to develop along the way a </v>

1044
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:20.141
<v Speaker 5>series a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a set of ethics,</v>

1045
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:25.150
<v Speaker 5>morals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We become a good person or you could </v>

1046
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.541
<v Speaker 5>become a good company as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you can kind of bribed your way </v>

1047
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 5>through the maze to get to the top and </v>
<v Speaker 5>be</v>

1048
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.060
<v Speaker 4>this fucking evil whoremonger murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cat.</v>

1049
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 4>And that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that we've seen both.</v>

1050
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think just that you say with ethics </v>

1051
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.190
<v Speaker 4>and morals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's important,</v>

1052
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 4>but there's no way to screen for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

1053
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 4>So I think what's really going to help </v>
<v Speaker 4>us out is just promoting better forms of</v>

1054
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we can.</v>

1055
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 4>We can give every new cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1056
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 4>the full star Trek Federation lesson and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1057
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.160
<v Speaker 4>don't you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prime directive don't do harm to </v>

1058
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.801
<v Speaker 4>others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can give them the whole download in </v>

1059
00:48:01.801 --> 00:48:02.410
<v Speaker 4>terms of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might skip that lesson,</v>

1060
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:07.411
<v Speaker 4>they might not actually get that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they have a body camera on them </v>

1061
00:48:07.411 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 4>at all hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're on duty.</v>

1062
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:12.800
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really matter because we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have some accountability and </v>

1063
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 4>that's due to technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think with this bitcoin stuff,</v>

1064
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:18.271
<v Speaker 4>it's the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're still going to have shitty </v>

1065
00:48:18.271 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 4>governments and shitty people and greedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations,</v>

1066
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:23.940
<v Speaker 4>but now somebody can actually track all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and we can watch it happening in </v>

1067
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:23.940
<v Speaker 4>real time.</v>

1068
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.530
<v Speaker 4>And that right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1069
00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:29.550
<v Speaker 4>even if I didn't own any that right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is enough of an upgrade that I'd </v>

1070
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.791
<v Speaker 4>be willing to fight for it because what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have right now is fucking chaos and </v>

1071
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:36.571
<v Speaker 4>it's not working for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be really interesting to </v>

1072
00:48:36.571 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 4>see if something like Bitcoin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately whatever coin it is,</v>

1073
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 4>if it does become big enough that it has</v>
<v Speaker 4>a significant impact on the world.</v>

1074
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Because as soon as that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>

1075
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:50.250
<v Speaker 4>if the balance starts to sway in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction and people start hopping on </v>

1076
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:54.601
<v Speaker 4>that and then that becomes the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>people start exchanging goods and </v>

1077
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 4>purchasing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could really be a monumental shift in</v>

1078
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:03.631
<v Speaker 4>human culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really be like the first time </v>

1079
00:49:03.631 --> 00:49:06.151
<v Speaker 4>ever people have a full say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if people really do get to that </v>

1080
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:12.631
<v Speaker 4>state where we no longer need a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just what a giant chunk of</v>

1081
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:19.081
<v Speaker 4>the economy would be eliminated with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant chunk of the people that control </v>

1082
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.090
<v Speaker 4>massive amounts of resources and money.</v>

1083
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.540
<v Speaker 4>There would be just shit out of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole class of people in New </v>

1084
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:27.790
<v Speaker 4>York that are basically professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

1085
00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:32.791
<v Speaker 4>men and many women and they will go away</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they will be the most unmissed class</v>

1086
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 4>of people in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Notoriously ruthless.</v>

1087
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1088
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 4>totally selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Took money from taxpayers and then </v>

1089
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 4>turned around and still foreclosed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these millions of people.</v>

1090
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.350
<v Speaker 4>And it's not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1091
00:49:45.351 --> 00:49:50.351
<v Speaker 4>some of them are great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that the financial system that </v>

1092
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:54.840
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you work in a </v>

1093
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:54.840
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be the best butcher there.</v>

1094
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 4>You're still in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1095
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the system they work in.</v>

1096
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:02.971
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes bitcoin so different is that </v>

1097
00:50:02.971 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't designed to make money off of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1098
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.640
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess we can't tell what his </v>

1099
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:08.640
<v Speaker 4>intentions were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the way it works,</v>

1100
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't need to make a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 4>off of you to send money.</v>

1101
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:14.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a fee based thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What doesn't make sense about how much </v>

1102
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 4>money bankers make?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>

1103
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:21.811
<v Speaker 4>You just move money around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get so much of it that you get to </v>

1104
00:50:21.811 --> 00:50:21.811
<v Speaker 4>buy a castle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1105
00:50:21.811 --> 00:50:26.090
<v Speaker 4>they buy ads on TV convincing you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sign up for a 401k and then they make </v>

1106
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>their money on the management fee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much do you think</v>

1107
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they're given Samuel Jackson to do those</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn capital one commercials?</v>

1108
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they paid off his credit cards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few times,</v>

1109
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>but Samuel Jackson is a wealthy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1110
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:42.161
<v Speaker 1>he's a huge actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said one of the biggest actors in </v>

1111
00:50:42.161 --> 00:50:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still to this day,</v>

1112
00:50:42.161 --> 00:50:45.110
<v Speaker 1>how can they pay him to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they gave him a price.</v>

1113
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:50.111
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not that much time in </v>

1114
00:50:50.111 --> 00:50:51.791
<v Speaker 1>front of a green screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of actors that are </v>

1115
00:50:51.791 --> 00:50:51.791
<v Speaker 1>starting to do those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing capital one commercials.</v>

1116
00:50:51.791 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 1>They're doing like Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alec Baldwin.</v>

1117
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

1118
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems odd.</v>

1119
00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:01.930
<v Speaker 1>It seems odd bullets because banks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly psychological so they have to </v>

1120
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 1>keep raising the bar to keep our </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1121
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why would the movie stars be </v>

1122
00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>interested in doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are wealthy people.</v>

1123
00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:07.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what's confusing to me.</v>

1124
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You should get them in here and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

1125
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1126
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's probably just easy access</v>

1127
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:18.431
<v Speaker 1>to money I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's just a shit ton of </v>

1128
00:51:18.431 --> 00:51:21.551
<v Speaker 1>money to do a little work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like how much money they </v>

1129
00:51:21.551 --> 00:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about are really </v>

1130
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>wealthy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>

1131
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.900
<v Speaker 1>especially with Samuel Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is he like 65 or something like </v>

1132
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that at a certain point in time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>already a legend.</v>

1133
00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:34.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what happens after pulp </v>

1134
00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:34.291
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great actor forever.</v>

1135
00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:35.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of actors.</v>

1136
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:38.360
<v Speaker 1>They fuck it up towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of actors,</v>

1137
00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:42.590
<v Speaker 1>like towards the end they start sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all kind of fades off,</v>

1138
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start doing like those Robert </v>

1139
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 1>De Niro movies that he's been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

1140
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Deniro was doing fucking God damn</v>

1141
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:55.360
<v Speaker 1>terrible movies lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched one of them he did with John </v>

1142
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Travolta and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they pay him to do this?</v>

1143
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:02.441
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some John Travolta plays like the worst </v>

1144
00:52:02.441 --> 00:52:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Russian accent ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the both like killers and John </v>

1145

<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

1146

1157
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:36.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the greatest actors of all </v>

1158
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.790
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Region,</v>

1162
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.460
<v Speaker 1>we can't take away what he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they get to a certain point.</v>

1163
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1166
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:51.371

<v Speaker 1>Travolta and I were in the woods </v>

1167
00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:51.371
<v Speaker 1>shooting arrows at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1168
00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:51.371
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Pierce Brosnan.</v>

1169
00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 1>He's been in a couple of kind of lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>end things and he was bond not that long</v>

1170
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:55.350
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>He was like the least believable bond </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1172
00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1173
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 1>this guy ain't kicking no one's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's breaking his own hands.</v>

1174
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the.</v>

1175
00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to knock people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's of hurt himself.</v>

1176
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You think Daniel Craig is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>believable?</v>

1177
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 1>He's the most believable ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1178
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.960
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at him with his shirt off,</v>

1179
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a killer.</v>

1180
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Like he looks like a real killer.</v>

1181
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1182
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you look at Pierce Brosnan with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt off and you're like,</v>

1183
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is run up a flight of</v>

1184
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 1>stairs and wait for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not going to make it.</v>

1185
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not kicking everybody's ass better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Quick.</v>

1186
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 1>If he kicks your ass better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not take time because he's not going to </v>

1187
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:33.110
<v Speaker 1>be there 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 seconds into this.</v>

1188
00:53:33.111 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be huffing and puffing.</v>

1189
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:37.230
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more of a gun,</v>

1190
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 1>a gun based bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty man is very,</v>

1191
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 1>very nice hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy them as like a bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>like beating people up.</v>

1193
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They could get away with that back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

1194
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go back and watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original Batman and robin like Adam </v>

1195
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam West,</v>

1196
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>it looked like maybe someone made them </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a pushup at one point in time.</v>

1197
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it in no way shape or form.</v>

1198
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you look like an athlete?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1199
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>he didn't look like my Christian Bale </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclub.</v>

1200
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Exactly like Christian Bale and Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1201
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a bad ass.</v>

1202
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Which is pretty impressive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming off just like six months </v>

1203
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.350
<v Speaker 1>from him doing the machinists where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got down to some ungodly low weight.</v>

1204
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I think he was like 140 pounds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and he's a big guy.</v>

1205
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.570
<v Speaker 1>It might even been lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.380
<v Speaker 1>he's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1207
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 1>talking about good actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is come closer to dying for a </v>

1208
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that guy did in a role that sucked.</v>

1209
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean that movie sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the machinists.</v>

1210
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was not.</v>

1211
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Not The movie you want almost die for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think also that a guy </v>

1212
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:49.731
<v Speaker 1>that's losing that much weight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially starving himself to death </v>

1213
00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:49.731
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1214
00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy doesn't have much energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to act either.</v>

1215
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you lose that much weight,</v>

1216
00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:00.500
<v Speaker 1>like your body is fucking struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is hard to do.</v>

1217
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Getting up out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

1218
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:07.130
<v Speaker 1>You're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body body's eating itself and the </v>

1219
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.461
<v Speaker 1>only way to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lean in that thin there is on the </v>

1220
00:55:10.461 --> 00:55:10.461
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1221
00:55:10.461 --> 00:55:11.780
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him on the right.</v>

1222
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Six months later that it's unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1223
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but that's shit that he did to himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the guy on the left.</v>

1224
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He probably ruined his organs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1225
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:25.200
<v Speaker 1>he probably took years off of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1226
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard on your body to get that thin.</v>

1227
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You're eating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body starts atrophying.</v>

1228
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 1>It starts absorbing its own muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue and stay alive.</v>

1229
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're getting your protein</v>

1230
00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 1>from to eating its own body as fucked.</v>

1231
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 1>That is fucked for a goofy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty cents.</v>

1232
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:48.441
<v Speaker 1>Did it too for something people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make fun of on a podcast years </v>

1233
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:48.441
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1234
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:50.540
<v Speaker 1>some people might have enjoyed it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

1235
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 1>just I didn't think it was that good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1236
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He's a great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them in a lot of things.</v>

1237
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just that wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't worth fucking doing,</v>

1238
00:55:58.741 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1239
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 1>How do we get on him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losing weight?</v>

1240
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did we even go down this </v>
<v Speaker 1>road?</v>

1241
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably through bitcoin somewhere.</v>

1242
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to drive home.</v>

1243
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.250
<v Speaker 1>The bitcoin thing that like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

1244
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>it's too late because you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1245
00:56:14.011 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>would it be cool if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it would happen,</v>

1246
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:21.950
<v Speaker 1>this is the point where people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tech savvy and not Bill Gates or </v>

1248
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson need to look into it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those</v>

1249
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.710
<v Speaker 3>people have already made their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their beds.</v>

1250
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Richard Branson,</v>

1251
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.620
<v Speaker 3>very much a believer in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates went on Bloomberg and said </v>

1252
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:39.031
<v Speaker 3>Bitcoin is better than currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was only part of his </v>

1253
00:56:39.031 --> 00:56:41.731
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like bitcoin is better than </v>

1254
00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:41.731
<v Speaker 3>currency in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he explained why,</v>

1255
00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 3>but what's so weird about that is Bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gates back in 1995 was on Letterman,</v>

1256
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:51.120
<v Speaker 3>basically the same kind of interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about the Internet and the audience </v>

1257
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.901
<v Speaker 3>back then thought he was just as full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit as people today think bitcoin is </v>

1258
00:56:54.901 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 3>kind of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fad,</v>

1259
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:59.920
<v Speaker 3>when it's really not like Bill Gates </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't in the pumping bullshit business.</v>

1260
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the reality</v>

1261
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 5>of Bitcoin or have anything that's not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fully formed.</v>

1262
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.700
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely successful shift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1263
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

1264
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might think that bitcoin is it and it</v>

1265
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 5>might become,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's that other stuff?</v>

1266
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Doge coin and Doggy coin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1267
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 5>There are hundreds of them now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's hundreds of them,</v>

1268
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 5>so there might be one that comes along a</v>
<v Speaker 5>few years from now that's like ethically</v>

1269
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:29.521
<v Speaker 5>engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody comes along and some great </v>

1270
00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:32.221
<v Speaker 5>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematicians and economists get </v>

1271
00:57:32.221 --> 00:57:34.681
<v Speaker 5>together and they come up with a formula</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everyone agrees to and they launch </v>

1272
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 5>it and it's like the fucking large </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hadron collider where you get 10,000</v>

1273
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:41.761
<v Speaker 5>scientists from 100 different countries </v>
<v Speaker 5>working on this one project and they </v>

1274
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 5>come up with a universal form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>currency and essentially figure out some</v>

1275
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:50.190
<v Speaker 5>sort of a way to slowly but surely even </v>
<v Speaker 5>out the the,</v>

1276
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 5>the cultures financial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a distribution of wealth and that's like</v>

1277
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 5>a huge issue with people.</v>

1278
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:01.890
<v Speaker 5>The distribution of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's some because some people are </v>

1279
00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:01.890
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you man,</v>

1280
00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:02.740
<v Speaker 5>I earned this money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then some people are like,</v>

1281
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.800
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only way you could have that much </v>

1282
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.541
<v Speaker 5>money is if you've done something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>or if you found a loophole in a system </v>

1283
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:13.231
<v Speaker 5>that was absolutely unjust and once that</v>
<v Speaker 5>loopholes been created and once that </v>

1284
00:58:13.231 --> 00:58:16.951
<v Speaker 5>position has been established,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost impossible to even things </v>

1285
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:16.951
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not an even playing field,</v>

1286
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 5>especially if you inherited that money </v>
<v Speaker 5>or you got an a fucking divorce,</v>

1287
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all that kind of shit.</v>

1288
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 3>That's why this is so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

1289
00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:26.950
<v Speaker 3>that innovation of the money being </v>
<v Speaker 3>created through mining,</v>

1290
00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 3>it was a pretty smart idea because now </v>
<v Speaker 3>the distribution is,</v>

1291
00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:32.080
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair.</v>

1292
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 3>And even today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I left the house,</v>

1293
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.840
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin was at around $380,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three 85 chicken every day.</v>

1294
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:40.750
<v Speaker 5>Stock Market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do you one of those freaks.</v>

1295
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just check it because I can't not </v>

1296
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:46.490
<v Speaker 3>check it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much about that.</v>

1297
00:58:46.491 --> 00:58:51.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just interesting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was around 380 something and I was</v>

1298
00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:53.150
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1299
00:58:53.151 --> 00:58:55.010
<v Speaker 3>three 80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too expensive for a bitcoin.</v>

1300
00:58:55.011 --> 00:58:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wait until it drops,</v>

1301
00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.300
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're actually buying is.</v>

1302
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:04.750
<v Speaker 3>So one bitcoin equals 1 million bits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>already some of those services like a </v>

1303
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 3>light change tip or switching over to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bits instead of bitcoins because it's </v>

1304
00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 3>easier for the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:13.850
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to say you've received 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>bits than point zero five,</v>

1306
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:14.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1307
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that is happening.</v>

1308
00:59:18.681 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think that in a few years' time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe like years from now,</v>

1309
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 3>people will look back on this era and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1310
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:29.561
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was insanely undervalued because </v>

1311
00:59:29.561 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my whole thesis,</v>

1312
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.290
<v Speaker 3>my thesis is that we have bitcoin in </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

1313
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's possible too,</v>

1314
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:39.401
<v Speaker 3>but if it does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's one of those things </v>

1315
00:59:39.401 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 3>where we are not even in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think um,</v>

1316
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:46.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a cycle to a product and we're </v>

1317
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:46.780
<v Speaker 3>not even in the first stage of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle</v>

1318
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:51.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it's like Betamax looked promising </v>

1319
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:55.141
<v Speaker 1>and fucking fizzled off way before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then something that wasn't even as </v>

1320
00:59:55.141 --> 00:59:58.621
<v Speaker 1>good became much more successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we can agree then that one </v>

1321
00:59:58.621 --> 01:00:00.220
<v Speaker 1>of these cryptocurrencies is gonna is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna work.</v>

1322
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be one of the ones that's </v>

1323
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.461
<v Speaker 1>currently available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these cryptocurrencies didn't </v>

1324
01:00:08.461 --> 01:00:08.461
<v Speaker 1>exist a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1325
01:00:08.461 --> 01:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A decade is a very brief window in time.</v>

1326
01:00:09.911 --> 01:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It is 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cryptocurrencies,</v>

1327
01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>2014 over a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1328
01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>how many other there are hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and thousands.</v>

1329
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about this.</v>

1330
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's say a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1331
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.090
<v Speaker 3>coin one of the lingering problems is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1332
01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:28.100
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have bitcoin and it has whatever </v>

1333
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.681
<v Speaker 3>economic value it ends up having a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say you can use it as money and </v>

1334
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:34.461
<v Speaker 3>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you still have that's an issue </v>

1335
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 3>is the need for financial institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I want to earn interest on my </v>

1336
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to give it to somebody,</v>

1337
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do you have to earn interest on </v>

1338
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>your money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1339
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>That's like a firmly established thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people's minds that you have money,</v>

1340
01:00:43.851 --> 01:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you put it away somewhere when you earn </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

1341
01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just how people are trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
01:00:48.401 --> 01:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is stupid.</v>

1343
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>That's really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you give your money to a </v>

1344
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.121
<v Speaker 1>bank and the bank just hangs onto it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spends it a little bit here and there </v>

1345
01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:58.121
<v Speaker 1>and loans and out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then keeps as much as they can.</v>

1346
01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever want it back and go,</v>

1347
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.790
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds stupid because it's been so,</v>

1348
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:06.791
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been perverted in the favor of </v>

1349
01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:08.180
<v Speaker 3>institutions and not in the favor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>

1350
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.360
<v Speaker 3>So one of these ideas is if you give </v>
<v Speaker 3>your money to a bitcoin bank and they </v>

1351
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.411
<v Speaker 3>pay you interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still the possibility that that </v>

1352
01:01:17.411 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 3>bank can fail and they have to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money somewhere.</v>

1353
01:01:17.871 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 3>So they have to loan out things and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>risks.</v>

1354
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And they could fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a currency,</v>

1355
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 3>actually a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>

1356
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 3>one of them is hyper and the algorithm </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually creates its own interest.</v>

1357
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 3>So unlike bitcoin where it just sits </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1358
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.000
<v Speaker 3>this coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just by running it on your computer,</v>

1359
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 3>you earn more of the coins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they've done is created so that </v>

1360
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.661
<v Speaker 3>anybody with just a normal computer can </v>
<v Speaker 3>run the software that actually creates </v>

1361
01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:47.381
<v Speaker 3>more currency for that network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because with bitcoin you can only do </v>

1362
01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:47.750
<v Speaker 3>that if you're running the mining </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardware,</v>

1363
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.580
<v Speaker 3>which is really kind of expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>observe</v>

1364
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1365
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>is that an infant growth paradigm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea behind it just continues </v>

1366
01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>on forever and ever and continues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate interest.</v>

1367
01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't continue forever because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in five years it scales down and then it</v>

1368
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>scales down again that scales down </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the software,</v>

1369
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>through the schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all been scheduled at the same with</v>

1370
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Bitcoin,</v>

1371
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoin is just the amount that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

1372
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>The last</v>

1373
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm using the word interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it really is,</v>

1374
01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:19.050
<v Speaker 3>is they found a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1375
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:24.290
<v Speaker 3>with Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the miners are the ones who are earning </v>

1376
01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 3>new coins by running that algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This algorithm,</v>

1377
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:30.410
<v Speaker 3>just by running the wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supporting the network and </v>

1378
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 3>running those transactions for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a result,</v>

1379
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those coins.</v>

1380
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 3>And so they've just kind of democratized</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mining process.</v>

1381
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 3>So now every single user is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>a minor and it changes the way you think</v>

1382
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 3>about money because with Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what bitcoin did is,</v>

1383
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath the central bank to issue </v>

1384
01:02:47.751 --> 01:02:47.751
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you now have money.</v>

1385
01:02:47.751 --> 01:02:47.760
<v Speaker 3>It just exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And with things like hyper,</v>

1386
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:52.761
<v Speaker 3>you no longer have the need for a bank </v>
<v Speaker 3>to issue interests because the coin </v>

1387
01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:56.571
<v Speaker 3>itself is capable of bearing interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have something that just cannot </v>

1388
01:02:56.571 --> 01:02:57.970
<v Speaker 3>be corrupted by any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1389
01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who the fuck is using hyper?</v>

1390
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it one percent of the people that use</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin?</v>

1391
01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it even that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1392
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>how many people are using bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tiny percentage of the </v>

1393
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.441
<v Speaker 1>population of renting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with a tiny </v>

1394
01:03:11.441 --> 01:03:11.441
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny percentage.</v>

1395
01:03:11.441 --> 01:03:11.441
<v Speaker 1>It's still very.</v>

1396
01:03:11.441 --> 01:03:15.920
<v Speaker 3>It's used by Gamers and online worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was fucking gamers.</v>

1397
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:18.320
<v Speaker 3>The online world thing is becoming more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

1398
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:23.530
<v Speaker 3>an economy because in a few years people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to have oculus rifts on and </v>

1399
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:27.760
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be exploring around in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their living rooms and even though </v>

1400
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.520
<v Speaker 3>they're just on a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything they do has some kind of real</v>

1401
01:03:28.521 --> 01:03:33.521
<v Speaker 3>economic value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can port that value in somehow </v>

1402
01:03:33.521 --> 01:03:33.770
<v Speaker 3>you could do neat thing.</v>

1403
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be in the Matrix inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 20 years.</v>

1404
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>In 20 years we're going to be just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Keanu Reeves,</v>

1405
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>a big fucking Frisbee in the back of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

1406
01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of connected to a tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think we'll have to write into the </v>

1407
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>system and go out full ai within 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years so you can just ask Siri and it's.</v>

1408
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll have robots.</v>

1409
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You'll have like a person like a robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Butler or something like that that hands</v>

1410
01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:59.341
<v Speaker 1>around hangs around your house and hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>you things and does things for you and </v>

1411
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:00.560
<v Speaker 1>schedules things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the robot girlfriend while you.</v>

1412
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be an ethical dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's probably coming to </v>

1413
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>ethical dilemma I've already resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1414
01:04:05.861 --> 01:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>you were cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm set just fucking around,</v>

1415
01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling the truth.</v>

1416
01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>If you've had a really hot like traci </v>
<v Speaker 1>lords in her prime robot,</v>

1417
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1418
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>If I really couldn't tell the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people couldn't either.</v>

1419
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>That's where the problem sets and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why wouldn't you order when she </v>

1420
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>starts crying when you leave and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1421
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1422
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an interstellar.</v>

1423
01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to deprogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

1424
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't give any spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck up,</v>

1425
01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This boilers,</v>

1426
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of ais is very captivating and </v>

1427
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Ai to me is very similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of what must have been the idea</v>

1428
01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>of the atomic bomb before it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially dropped.</v>

1429
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>

1430
01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it's so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to not do it.</v>

1431
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the atomic bomb,</v>

1432
01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>of course it was like during the war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were worried about the Nazis coming</v>

1433
01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>up with it first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there was no war going on,</v>

1434
01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they were still wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with the fucking atomic bomb.</v>

1435
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>They just would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1436
01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if they were worried that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else would have first,</v>

1437
01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:08.971
<v Speaker 1>even if there was no war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those things where once </v>

1438
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've made it.</v>

1439
01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.640
<v Speaker 1>The cat's out of the bag and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that this is a part of </v>

1440
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>reality and I think that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case with artificial intelligence.</v>

1441
01:05:16.481 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you make</v>

1442
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sure?</v>

1443
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hit the button,</v>

1444
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:25.921
<v Speaker 5>let him go live and then you know he </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts doing things for you and you go </v>

1445
01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:26.050
<v Speaker 5>to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get up in the mornings from in front</v>

1446
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 5>of your fucking computer and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>designing a far better robot.</v>

1447
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like you've made mistakes and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to correct them and here's,</v>

1448
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:36.841
<v Speaker 5>here's the best way to design the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>level of me and then he designs and </v>

1449
01:05:36.841 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 5>makes the next level of him and the next</v>
<v Speaker 5>level of him kills all the people.</v>

1450
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:43.480
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking smarter people and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are a parasite live.</v>

1451
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:48.481
<v Speaker 5>We're just going to make robot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that don't litter don't have any </v>

1452
01:05:48.481 --> 01:05:52.681
<v Speaker 5>problems and we're all sync up together </v>
<v Speaker 5>on one network and our goal is to live </v>

1453
01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:56.791
<v Speaker 5>harmoniously with all the other life </v>
<v Speaker 5>forms on earth with nothing out of </v>

1454
01:05:56.791 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 5>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's we have an algorithm designed</v>

1455
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:02.431
<v Speaker 5>to achieve that were indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 5>biologically from actual people at this </v>

1456
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:07.441
<v Speaker 5>point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're so advanced with </v>

1457
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:07.441
<v Speaker 5>artificial cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even we can't tell,</v>

1458
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:11.580
<v Speaker 5>so what we'll do is we'll just only </v>
<v Speaker 5>exist in this form and all these </v>

1459
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:16.051
<v Speaker 5>imperfect prototypes that existed </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially just to hatch us.</v>

1460
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:21.690
<v Speaker 5>That's all they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were just cocooning themselves </v>

1461
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:21.690
<v Speaker 5>until they shit out some artificial </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1462
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Either there's gonna be a bit of a cylon</v>
<v Speaker 5>mentality then yeah,</v>

1463
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.660
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be an elitism.</v>

1464
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be smarter than us.</v>

1465
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:31.111
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be better than us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're gonna realize how flawed we </v>

1466
01:06:31.111 --> 01:06:31.111
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were we?</v>

1467
01:06:31.111 --> 01:06:31.450
<v Speaker 5>We were a biological computers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1468
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:36.750
<v Speaker 5>but we're biological computers that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>never designed or we have been designed </v>

1469
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:42.240
<v Speaker 5>by trial and error and natural selection</v>
<v Speaker 5>and genetics and learned behavior </v>

1470
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 5>patterns and adapt to our environments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at the end of the day,</v>

1471
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:53.310
<v Speaker 5>what they're going to be able to do if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you really do have artificial </v>

1472
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 5>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you really do create something that's</v>

1473
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:59.750
<v Speaker 5>superintelligent artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't born out of cells and mating </v>

1474
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:04.561
<v Speaker 5>and evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just something that a human being </v>

1475
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:07.741
<v Speaker 5>created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fucking thing's going to have some </v>

1476
01:07:07.741 --> 01:07:07.741
<v Speaker 5>real different ideas about how to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1477
01:07:07.741 --> 01:07:10.600
<v Speaker 4>It really is like Elon Musk warned that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1478
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.900
<v Speaker 4>will be summoning the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1479
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 4>that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would listen to him,</v>

1481
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 4>that guy smart as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is way fucking smarter than me.</v>

1482
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 4>So if I'm worried about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm an idiot.</v>

1483
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Like literally what are guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually coders?</v>

1484
01:07:24.011 --> 01:07:25.360
<v Speaker 4>What are they actually thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1485
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.870
<v Speaker 4>it's neat how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1486
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.920
<v Speaker 4>there's an article in wired about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole ai thing and the article was good </v>

1487
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.461
<v Speaker 4>until the end when it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to go on this journey so that </v>

1488
01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:38.971
<v Speaker 4>these machines will tell us who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the part where I was like </v>

1489
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 4>vomit because Barf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1490
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.240
<v Speaker 4>these people who are looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>singularity is this is what we need to </v>

1491
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 4>get to so they can get personal answers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and personal meaning.</v>

1492
01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Have they tried first like a weed </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brownie or something?</v>

<v Speaker 4>like I think the.</v>

1494
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I think the answer is they're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>for are not going to be split up by a </v>

1495
01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:58.460
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are like personal things.</v>

1496
01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you ever get the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1497
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 4>I think you get some answers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get some peace.</v>

1498
01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1500
01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1501

<v Speaker 5>What is the meaning of life?</v>

1503
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard one to crush your enemies</v>

1504
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:21.790
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three driven them before you knew </v>

1505
01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the laminations of the women laminations</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations and the limitations of their</v>

1506
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great quote.</v>

1507
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he wasn't even acting.</v>

1508
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It was just kind of just letting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's at a good.</v>

1509
01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Then there's no meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your meaning of life is different than </v>

1510
01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine's different than yours.</v>

1511
01:08:39.981 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like we overall different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would if you were a guy who,</v>

1512
01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to fix shoes,</v>

1513
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were forced to make podcasts all</v>

1514
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be bummed out,</v>

1515
01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck podcasts.</v>

1516
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I like fixing shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be some really bad podcasts.</v>

1517
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you were in that shoe fixer place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I told you about,</v>

1518
01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>he'd be bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1519
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about bitcoin.</v>

1520
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.080
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do people know about bitcoin?</v>

1521
01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I accept shoe payments going in anyway </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1522
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll accept bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1523
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:10.270
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1524
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody's life is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people's lives that they </v>

1525
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:15.400
<v Speaker 1>love that you would want to fucking kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1526
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to live as a fucking fur </v>

1527
01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 1>trapper in the middle of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd kill yourself and be like,</v>

1528
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a jet ski to Work Everyday or</v>

1529
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Wales Snow Skis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1530
01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:30.551
<v Speaker 1>my level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of enjoyment would totally </v>

1531
01:09:30.551 --> 01:09:30.551
<v Speaker 1>depend on if there is a medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana because if there was,</v>

1532
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I would love the winter there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be high as fuck in a log </v>

1533
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>cabin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1534
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I would be panicking though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1535
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to freeze to death out here.</v>

1536
01:09:36.831 --> 01:09:41.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run out of what I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to eat the house I'm gonna have </v>

1537
01:09:41.831 --> 01:09:41.831
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my house on fire to heat it.</v>

1538
01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times where you're living in </v>

1539
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:49.460
<v Speaker 1>those places where you have to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get wood and it's 30 below zero.</v>

1540
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.940
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start chopping down wood because if you </v>

1541
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:54.940
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to make it.</v>

1542
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like those kinds of situations.</v>

1543
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1544
01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:58.970
<v Speaker 1>anything that ends in your role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to make it.</v>

1545
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I draw the line.</v>

1546
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're like kind of cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in bed already or already cold,</v>

1547
01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:12.041
<v Speaker 1>you're wrapped up and you're freezing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking over at the log pie </v>

1548
01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:12.041
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to go outside.</v>

1550

<v Speaker 1>You have to shut it again and pull it </v>

1555

<v Speaker 1>tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pole at shots and you're out there with </v>

<v Speaker 1>stay out here and it sounds like the </v>

<v Speaker 5>live in this era and be like these </v>

<v Speaker 5>covered in ice.</v>

1594
01:12:17.871 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 5>This is back when the continents were </v>
<v Speaker 5>connected and you could</v>

1595
01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:25.690
<v Speaker 4>walk from Russia to Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all frozen ground.</v>

1596
01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 4>I must have been a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

1597
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do people walked here from Russia also?</v>

1598
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.510
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of generational progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1599
01:12:34.511 --> 01:12:39.511
<v Speaker 4>you get the whole generations where your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is pretty much the same as your </v>

1600
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 4>parents and their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point now.</v>

1601
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a decent chance that if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have kids someday,</v>

1602
01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.290
<v Speaker 4>my kids will be on a spaceship at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in their lives.</v>

1603
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Very possibly the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't fuck it up.</v>

1604
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1605
01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:54.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're on a decent path now.</v>

1606
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I was really concerned for a few years </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was kinda creepy.</v>

1607
01:12:57.011 --> 01:13:00.070
<v Speaker 4>All the surveillance stuff and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not concerned anymore.</v>

1608
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still concerned about those things,</v>

1609
01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:04.870
<v Speaker 4>but I think that now the math is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>set in our favor.</v>

1610
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:05.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1611
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.110
<v Speaker 4>whenever something starts to take off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1612
01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.100
<v Speaker 4>it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1613
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:14.250
<v Speaker 4>this is surveillance stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real issue is going to be for them </v>

1614
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.260
<v Speaker 4>that as technology becomes more and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>pervasive,</v>

1615
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:18.610
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1616
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:24.130
<v Speaker 5>it's going to connect everybody to it so</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be possible to shield </v>

1617
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.090
<v Speaker 5>themselves from the impact of that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all in a lot of ways.</v>

1618
01:13:29.091 --> 01:13:32.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like the Internet itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when they made the Internet,</v>

1619
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:35.870
<v Speaker 5>they didn't really foresee what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential uses of it.</v>

1620
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:40.930
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They use that as a method where they </v>

1621
01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:45.071
<v Speaker 5>could send information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a a network that they could </v>

1622
01:13:45.071 --> 01:13:47.620
<v Speaker 5>connect and send files back and forth to</v>
<v Speaker 5>different computers.</v>

1623
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was essentially the original</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea behind it,</v>

1624
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.240
<v Speaker 5>but along the way they unintentionally </v>
<v Speaker 5>engineered the greatest revolution of </v>

1625
01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.140
<v Speaker 5>thought that the human race has ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen.</v>

1626
01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.200
<v Speaker 5>By far in my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen radical changes in the way </v>

1627
01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:06.800
<v Speaker 5>people view ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>establish truths,</v>

1628
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:10.310
<v Speaker 5>find out information on their phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>within seconds,</v>

1629
01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:15.311
<v Speaker 5>get access.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially the database of the </v>

1630
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:15.311
<v Speaker 5>human race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is.</v>

1631
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.400
<v Speaker 5>This is a big crazy fucking change and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it happened in our lifetime and it </v>

1632
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.931
<v Speaker 5>happened really quickly and it happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>because nobody saw it comment and I </v>

1633
01:14:24.931 --> 01:14:28.711
<v Speaker 5>think that what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>inadvertently by spying on people,</v>

1634
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 5>by checking everybody's emails and by </v>
<v Speaker 5>checking everybody's text messages,</v>

1635
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:38.260
<v Speaker 5>there are inadvertently creating </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology that they thought would </v>

1636
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.251
<v Speaker 5>empower them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They thought this top technology is </v>

1637
01:14:41.251 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 5>going to allow us to keep an eye on all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these.</v>

1638
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:46.561
<v Speaker 5>No good troublemakers out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what they didn't consider is it's </v>

1639
01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:49.550
<v Speaker 5>eventually going to grow and expand to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where keeps an eye on youtube.</v>

1640
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You too.</v>

1641
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 5>It's going to know you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

1642
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

1643
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:52.990
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Made me,</v>

1644
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 5>but we need a firewall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no such thing.</v>

1645
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:56.890
<v Speaker 5>It's not this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've gotten nano.</v>

1646
01:14:56.891 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 5>There's no firewalls anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1647
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has access to everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is what it is and now everybody </v>

1648
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:07.420
<v Speaker 5>knows you're a pedophile and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows you're a fucking creep.</v>

1649
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.930
<v Speaker 5>Now everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1650
01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.960
<v Speaker 5>the only reason why you got your job is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you bribed such and such and </v>

1651
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.821
<v Speaker 5>paid off this and that and you have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>really unethical deal with this company </v>

1652
01:15:17.821 --> 01:15:21.550
<v Speaker 5>to does this to the land and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be responsible because you knew</v>

1653
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:26.551
<v Speaker 5>that they were poisoning those rivers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and here's all these children that were </v>

1654
01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:29.461
<v Speaker 5>born with birth defects that lived down </v>
<v Speaker 5>river from this in these small villages </v>

1655
01:15:29.461 --> 01:15:33.270
<v Speaker 5>because they didn't have a say because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have any political </v>

1656
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.940
<v Speaker 5>representation and no one had to say at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking meeting when you said it was</v>

1657
01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 5>okay to dump toxic slime into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking river.</v>

1658
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.640
<v Speaker 5>All that's gonna happen is you're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be accountable for all crimes against</v>

1659
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:47.551
<v Speaker 5>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who's doing anything that the </v>

1660
01:15:47.551 --> 01:15:48.820
<v Speaker 5>American public looks at the world view </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks at and says,</v>

1661
01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:53.821
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you motherfuckers are profiting off of </v>

1662
01:15:53.821 --> 01:15:56.460
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's doctors that got paid off </v>

1663
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.260
<v Speaker 5>money to create laws or to help </v>
<v Speaker 5>establish laws,</v>

1664
01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:04.261
<v Speaker 5>to advise on laws that make no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That eventually wound up getting more </v>

1665
01:16:04.261 --> 01:16:06.550
<v Speaker 5>people locked up for drug offenses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's doctors that have been paid off.</v>

1666
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:11.551
<v Speaker 5>By that I mean that was the big thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>before Sanjay Gupta when I mean kinda </v>

1667
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 5>like completely flipped the switch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>went pro medical marijuana,</v>

1668
01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.000
<v Speaker 3>pro human being and throw humor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN.</v>

1669
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.520
<v Speaker 5>Well he was being paid off by </v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

1670
01:16:20.521 --> 01:16:22.800
<v Speaker 5>That was like one of the big things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was found out about him.</v>

1671
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Dr Drew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing.</v>

1672
01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:24.440
<v Speaker 5>They get</v>

1673
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.370
<v Speaker 3>paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get paid to be consultants.</v>

1674
01:16:26.371 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 3>They get paid to give advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1675
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:32.780
<v Speaker 3>it's so disgusting in 2014 that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of Florida only lost the medical </v>

1676
01:16:33.181 --> 01:16:36.690
<v Speaker 3>marijuana thing by a few percentage </v>
<v Speaker 3>points to add to get to 60 percent.</v>

1677
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:38.770
<v Speaker 3>And I think the guy around 57,</v>
<v Speaker 3>57,</v>

1678
01:16:38.771 --> 01:16:40.180
<v Speaker 3>56,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was six,</v>

1679
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:46.080
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that because there's so many people </v>

1680
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.350
<v Speaker 3>in pain in the state of Florida and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go on shit like Oxycontin,</v>

1681
01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:48.960
<v Speaker 3>which is dangerous and your shit your </v>
<v Speaker 3>liver out.</v>

1682
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.740
<v Speaker 3>We'd since the time of Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a single overdose and they're not,</v>

1683
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:54.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not giving people access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so.</v>

1684
01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It's so in your face corrupt and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1685
01:16:57.691 --> 01:16:59.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the other reason for it?</v>

1686
01:16:59.071 --> 01:17:00.120
<v Speaker 3>And there is not a reason.</v>

1687
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.640
<v Speaker 5>It's not corrupt though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just they didn't make it.</v>

1688
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 5>They didn't do a good job and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get to the 60 percent.</v>

1689
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 5>They needed to change the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is to get past</v>

1690
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>as far as like public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you like 50 percent.</v>

1691
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:16.460
<v Speaker 1>But there is anti anti legalization </v>
<v Speaker 1>money spent.</v>

1692
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's always going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>get ready old people,</v>

1693
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>old people are dumb as fuck and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floors infested with them and they still</v>

1694
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:28.841
<v Speaker 1>believe that marijuana is make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking feet fall off and you hear your </v>

1695
01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:31.550
<v Speaker 1>ears go numb and you're fucking one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to make the jazz too loud</v>

1696
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and to make the jazz too loud and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that white penis is shrink.</v>

1697
01:17:34.841 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>A black penises actually get larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

1698
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think marijuana's a about chocolate</v>

1699
01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 1>study to gives your brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1700
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:49.811
<v Speaker 1>there's always a study that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another recall they might've </v>

1701
01:17:49.811 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>saw on the back page of us weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1702
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1703
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's hard getting a bunch of people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board with especially something that </v>

1704
01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:56.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anything to do with.</v>

1705
01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.040
<v Speaker 1>If they're all golfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these goddamn kids.</v>

1706
01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Their pot trying to get my golfing in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf game's picked up.</v>

1707
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:07.331
<v Speaker 1>David Chapman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to fucking pot heads out </v>

1708
01:18:07.331 --> 01:18:07.760
<v Speaker 1>here and ruin in golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me that is.</v>

1709
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 1>That is the counterpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

1710
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were close to 60 percent,</v>

1711
01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 1>which is what they needed to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>

1712
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 1>the state constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1713
01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:19.991
<v Speaker 1>They'll get it next time around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should know they should finish </v>

1714
01:18:19.991 --> 01:18:19.991
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four percentage points.</v>

1715
01:18:19.991 --> 01:18:24.330
<v Speaker 1>It would be really dumb for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially to ignore the fact that the </v>

1716
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.520
<v Speaker 1>money's being spent no matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1717
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:30.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just being spent in going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand of drug dealers or I'm paying </v>

1718
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.550
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid strategy,</v>

1719
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:35.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're denying people access to </v>

1720
01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:35.770
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that are doing it,</v>

1721
01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:36.180
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1722
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 1>they're cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1723
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:43.090
<v Speaker 1>these people that are the pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that are so concerned with </v>

1724
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>this marijuana coming in and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything up,</v>

1725
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:47.720
<v Speaker 1>they're spending millions and millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars to demonize it and they.</v>

1726
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:52.010
<v Speaker 1>They've donated shitloads of money to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership for a drug free America.</v>

1727
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Like all of that is just just a strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make whatever they're selling have a </v>

1728
01:18:57.861 --> 01:19:00.110
<v Speaker 1>longer shelf life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can keep selling it for two,</v>

1729
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four more years,</v>

1730
01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever money grabbed they're on right </v>

1731
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:06.520
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1732
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.701
<v Speaker 1>our studies show we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can keep our finger in this dike for </v>

1733
01:19:09.701 --> 01:19:13.391
<v Speaker 1>up to 16 more months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have 80 percent old people and</v>

1734
01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:16.490
<v Speaker 1>none of them are online and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>googling shit,</v>

1735
01:19:16.491 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 1>so let's just tell them that marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes black people go crazy.</v>

1736
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It makes them go crazy and start dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on white people's cars.</v>

1737
01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird to learn that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is actually the basis for drug </v>

1738
01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.141
<v Speaker 1>policy was a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist doctor in Louisiana in the 19 </v>

1739
01:19:32.141 --> 01:19:33.950
<v Speaker 1>thirties and then Nixon being insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1740
01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way before Nixon.</v>

1741
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:41.291
<v Speaker 1>Of course it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea was if you believe the </v>

1742
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>story was all engineered by William </v>
<v Speaker 1>Randolph hearst or to sell more,</v>

1743
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to make sure that he gets cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper that was made from trees.</v>

1744
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:56.410
<v Speaker 1>We had paper he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He not only did he own a newspaper </v>

1745
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:59.030
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1747
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also owned these processing mills</v>

1748
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>and these giant chunks of land that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with and he would chop the trees</v>

1749
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.970
<v Speaker 5>down and turn them in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1750
01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 5>he was going to have to convert </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to hemp.</v>

1751
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Hemp was going to be the new paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way better paper and amazing to </v>

1752
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 5>this day that the paper we use on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily basis is made out of trees because</v>

1753
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:25.431
<v Speaker 5>it's the stupidest way to make paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes way too long to generate like </v>

1754
01:20:25.431 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 5>acres of trees that are viable that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can chop down and turned into paper with</v>

1755
01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:33.090
<v Speaker 5>the marijuana every fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a new giant crop.</v>

1756
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 5>He chopped that shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your replanted.</v>

1757
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:38.040
<v Speaker 5>It grows like a weed because it is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking weed.</v>

1758
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 5>It gets huge really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1759
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.990
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking ridiculous how fast pot </v>
<v Speaker 5>grows.</v>

1760
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 5>And the paper far superior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the fibers way stronger.</v>

1761
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It's light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's strong.</v>

1762
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 5>You can make houses with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1763
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:54.540
<v Speaker 5>it's like they make particle board,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the shitty type of plywood and</v>

1764
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:57.570
<v Speaker 5>they make it with like little chips of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wood from a lumber yard and they glue it</v>

1765
01:20:57.571 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 5>all together and press it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That when they make that shit with him,</v>

1766
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.780
<v Speaker 5>it's way stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way lighter.</v>

1767
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:08.830
<v Speaker 3>It's good for clothing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a company in Santa Monica that </v>

1768
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:11.831
<v Speaker 3>makes polo shirts and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wick much better than a cotton polo</v>

1769
01:21:11.991 --> 01:21:16.991
<v Speaker 3>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel as sweaty and gross by </v>

1770
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:16.991
<v Speaker 3>the end of the day.</v>

1771
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:19.830
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost ridiculous how many uses </v>

1772
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 5>hemp and marijuana have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost ridiculous when you look at </v>

1773
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.280
<v Speaker 5>the fact that it's actually an illegal </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant in most of the country.</v>

1774
01:21:24.281 --> 01:21:26.320
<v Speaker 5>Even hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the non psychoactive version of it,</v>

1775
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:30.340
<v Speaker 5>that it's illegal in most of the country</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 2014.</v>

1776
01:21:30.341 --> 01:21:30.700
<v Speaker 5>It just.</v>

1777
01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:35.980
<v Speaker 3>This goes back to the status thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people aren't some kind of </v>

1778
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.850
<v Speaker 3>trance like I definitely like I see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>need for laws and roads and everything,</v>

1779
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:43.390
<v Speaker 3>but just because something is illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you put something on a sheet that </v>

1780
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:45.440
<v Speaker 3>says controlled substances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely arbitrary.</v>

1781
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Nobody outside of the United States even</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizes that and historically </v>

1782
01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have been around for thousands of</v>

1783
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.160
<v Speaker 3>years and using this plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where does that arrogance seep in </v>

1784
01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.110
<v Speaker 3>that you can just put something on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet of paper and suddenly like </v>

1785
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 3>everybody's lifestyle has to change or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't you can put them in.</v>

1786
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:04.240
<v Speaker 5>It goes back to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about before.</v>

1787
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:09.450
<v Speaker 5>So this all happened because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had like a disconnect between people</v>

1788
01:22:10.361 --> 01:22:12.420
<v Speaker 5>and the distribution of information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1789
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you stood on top of our platform and </v>

1790
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.861
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here you hear Yeahi find people of the </v>

1791
01:22:19.861 --> 01:22:21.931
<v Speaker 5>town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the king has come forth with the new </v>

1792
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:21.931
<v Speaker 5>law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new law,</v>

1793
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:23.320
<v Speaker 5>the states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you say that,</v>

1794
01:22:23.321 --> 01:22:25.270
<v Speaker 5>and then the people are left in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>helpless state.</v>

1795
01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the law.</v>

1796
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.660
<v Speaker 5>While again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the law now and you don't,</v>

1797
01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 5>you don't get a line of communication </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get this weird sense of </v>

1798
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 5>separation like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1799
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.380
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that person is different.</v>

1800
01:22:35.381 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 5>He's the king,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he passes like,</v>

1801
01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.380
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking person.</v>

1802
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:43.500
<v Speaker 5>They're all just people and that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's being exposed was being exposed </v>

1803
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.700
<v Speaker 5>as there is no special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just people.</v>

1804
01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 5>Just because you're the president </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean you get to lock people up </v>

1805
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:52.210
<v Speaker 5>because they want to smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because you're a judge doesn't mean</v>

1806
01:22:52.211 --> 01:22:54.640
<v Speaker 5>if I say fuck you to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's different than you saying,</v>

1807
01:22:54.641 --> 01:22:55.870
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me it's the same.</v>

1808
01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:57.650
<v Speaker 5>We're just people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you say fuck you,</v>

1809
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.460
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't say fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really kind of mean,</v>

1810
01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:03.400
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a mean to say go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1811
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mean to say you.</v>

1812
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:08.530
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mean to say mean things.</v>

1813
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.170
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows what the fuck got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That entails.</v>

1814
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:16.540
<v Speaker 5>So this idea that they're more important</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they're more valuable or their,</v>

1815
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:17.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

1816
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 5>their state of mind is to be looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>with higher regard than yours.</v>

1817
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 5>They're to be treated with reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all rise.</v>

1818
01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 5>The honorable David Seaman has entered </v>
<v Speaker 5>the room and you walk in with your </v>

1819
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:32.550
<v Speaker 5>fucking goofy 15 hundreds outfit on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bib on,</v>

1820
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 5>please be seated and everybody sits down</v>
<v Speaker 5>after you do,</v>

1821
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 5>of course you sit first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in charge.</v>

1822
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.480
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking ridiculous and gavel and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1823
01:23:41.481 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of thinking is very similar to</v>

1824
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:49.921
<v Speaker 5>censorship in a way that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>disempowering and it's frustrating and </v>

1825
01:23:49.921 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 5>it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1826
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't ring true and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's essentially,</v>

1827
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:58.650
<v Speaker 5>it's capitalizing on this leftover Alpha</v>
<v Speaker 5>male primate behavior system that we </v>

1828
01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 5>have stuck in our heads from when we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just trying to survive.</v>

1829
01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:08.071
<v Speaker 5>We're just trying to get away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>predators and get to the highest </v>

1830
01:24:08.071 --> 01:24:09.730
<v Speaker 5>branches and figure out where the cats </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get to us.</v>

1831
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:12.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so the people that lived the longest</v>

1832
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.400
<v Speaker 5>were the strongest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones you wanted to follow </v>

1833
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:17.400
<v Speaker 5>up because they're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Follow them and you'll make it.</v>

1834
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:17.880
<v Speaker 5>If you don't follow them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably not gonna.</v>

1835
01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Make It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the leader.</v>

1836
01:24:18.761 --> 01:24:20.440
<v Speaker 5>Follow the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to get out of here.</v>

1837
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 5>That's shit still stuck in our DNA.</v>

1838
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.320
<v Speaker 5>It's still a groove that's been dug into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking pathways of our behavior </v>

1839
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:31.660
<v Speaker 5>systems and we were struggling with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1840
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.840
<v Speaker 5>We're still struggling with that and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think ultimately that's one of the real </v>

1841
01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.811
<v Speaker 5>problems with like the idea of a group </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people leading millions to war.</v>

1842
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.470
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the problems with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a group of people dictating how money</v>

1843
01:24:44.471 --> 01:24:49.471
<v Speaker 5>gets distributed and who gets to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>what and all of that is very similar in </v>

1844
01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 5>a way and that we really can't have it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

1845
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.710
<v Speaker 5>We're too interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't accept it,</v>

1846
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.420
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't accept it.</v>

1847
01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:03.510
<v Speaker 5>It's frustrating and it causes descent </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's all ultimately it's unfair and </v>

1848
01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:09.301
<v Speaker 5>it's only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It only exists because it's always </v>

1849
01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:10.660
<v Speaker 5>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want it to refashion our culture.</v>

1850
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 5>Say if something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the White House got hit by a meteor,</v>

1851
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.180
<v Speaker 5>like the fucking penthouse got hit by </v>
<v Speaker 5>another one.</v>

1852
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:18.640
<v Speaker 5>This doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been proven.</v>

1853
01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:22.780
<v Speaker 5>It's from space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why would they only hit know if that</v>

1854
01:25:22.781 --> 01:25:27.781
<v Speaker 5>did happen and we have no central office</v>
<v Speaker 5>be pretty obvious that their intentions </v>

1855
01:25:27.781 --> 01:25:31.111
<v Speaker 5>were God would be super pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we had to reengineer our society.</v>

1856
01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>snowball's chance in hell.</v>

1857
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:38.380
<v Speaker 5>We would go back to the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

1858
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 5>It'd be bitcoins and pre roll joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A localized system.</v>

1859
01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.760
<v Speaker 5>They would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1860
01:25:42.761 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First thing we do is legalize LSD,</v>

1861
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.850
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things.</v>

1862
01:25:48.851 --> 01:25:53.851
<v Speaker 5>Legalized startup centers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>startup centers where people get your </v>

1863
01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:53.851
<v Speaker 5>head together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1864
01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:54.800
<v Speaker 5>instead of subways there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

1865
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:59.820
<v Speaker 5>get your head togethers and there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere and stock staffed by </v>

1866
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.290
<v Speaker 5>professionals and people always get </v>
<v Speaker 5>tired of me saying that like,</v>

1867
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the drugs really the answer to</v>

1868
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.790
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1869
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>they're not the answer to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're the doorway to the answer to</v>

1870
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:09.590
<v Speaker 1>everything and there is no answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything by the way,</v>

1871
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1872
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 1>they're a real good indicator of whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you're on the right track.</v>

1873
01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>There</v>

1874
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.130
<v Speaker 3>was it like I will after I did something</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the summer and had some interesting</v>

1875
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:20.730
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1876
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.840
<v Speaker 3>one of my old friends said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on becoming a human </v>

1877
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.021
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought it was a little </v>

1878
01:26:29.021 --> 01:26:30.161
<v Speaker 3>patronizing at first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I was thinking about it and I </v>

1879
01:26:30.161 --> 01:26:30.161
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1880
01:26:30.161 --> 01:26:32.831
<v Speaker 3>actually when you're an adult and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit your late twenties or early </v>

1881
01:26:32.831 --> 01:26:36.550
<v Speaker 3>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't had any kind of altered </v>

1882
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.550
<v Speaker 3>states like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just your loss,</v>

1883
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:37.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can totally live your life</v>

1884
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 3>out to the fullest without any of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1885
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:46.150
<v Speaker 3>but you have avoided something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly beautiful and different and </v>

1886
01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 3>we'll let you see things in a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1887
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 3>And everybody who has that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come back to earth,</v>

1888
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 3>so to speak as a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

1889
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.190
<v Speaker 3>if you look online and you search for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Jobs,</v>

1890
01:26:55.490 --> 01:27:00.490
<v Speaker 3>lsd quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see one of the top results is </v>

1891
01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:02.930
<v Speaker 3>what he had to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't necessarily get this unless</v>

1892
01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:06.020
<v Speaker 3>you read his biography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a big advocate of psychedelics.</v>

1893
01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:08.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't a regular user,</v>

1894
01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 3>which I found fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use the 10 or 15 times,</v>

1895
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.620
<v Speaker 1>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped a long time.</v>

1896
01:27:13.621 --> 01:27:18.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't like he was using it </v>

1897
01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:18.621
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of his life.</v>

1898
01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:18.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Alan Watts says,</v>

1899
01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Alan Watts said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get the,</v>

1900
01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:20.690
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the message,</v>

1901
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 3>hang up the receiver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang up the phone,</v>

1902
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a great way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it in some ways.</v>

1903
01:27:25.311 --> 01:27:30.311
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got steve jobs of whatever he </v>

1904
01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:30.311
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

1905
01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it arrogant to think that </v>

1906
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you've already got the message?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little.</v>

1907
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt like any psychedelic </v>

1908
01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The latest one was just a month ago or a</v>

1909
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:40.440
<v Speaker 1>couple months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before I fell my special.</v>

1910
01:27:40.441 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So I guess it was August and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1911
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like I got the message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

1912
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:48.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got another message,</v>

1913
01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1914
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:54.490
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely enlightening or </v>

1915
01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:57.910
<v Speaker 1>illuminating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely caused me to stop and </v>

1916
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.090
<v Speaker 1>think about it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it all the time,</v>

1917
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 1>but I would never be so cocky as to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the message.</v>

1918
01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a new message or a </v>

1919
01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:12.971
<v Speaker 1>new connection that I'm making or a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of the game that my mind gets </v>

1920
01:28:14.391 --> 01:28:15.230
<v Speaker 1>access to.</v>

1921
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

1922
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:21.100
<v Speaker 3>here's what's cocky is to be somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's never touched any of these things </v>

1923
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:22.070
<v Speaker 3>and you go at can't possibly have value </v>
<v Speaker 3>for other people.</v>

1924
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:22.760
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1925
01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:25.880
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you know that's a,</v>

1926
01:28:25.881 --> 01:28:30.881
<v Speaker 3>that's a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you and I were talking before we </v>

1927
01:28:30.881 --> 01:28:33.581
<v Speaker 3>started rolling Lisa Ling documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which aired on CNN about the Iowasca </v>

1928
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:36.840
<v Speaker 3>ceremonies in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1929
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:42.070
<v Speaker 3>my mom had it on Dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I went home for </v>

1930
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

1931
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to watch the documentary?</v>

1932
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:46.970
<v Speaker 3>And I put it on and I was expecting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the typical cnn take on,</v>

1933
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:49.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on psychedelics,</v>

1934
01:28:49.341 --> 01:28:54.341
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she started talking about this </v>

1935
01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:54.341
<v Speaker 3>young boy who died down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1936
01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:54.341
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1937
01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna be the focus of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hour is this idiot.</v>

1938
01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:59.660
<v Speaker 3>But as it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an incredibly fair take.</v>

1939
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 3>And it followed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1940
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 3>experience of some Marines who had </v>
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic,</v>

1941
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:06.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know ptsd really bad,</v>

1942
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:11.151
<v Speaker 3>like to the extent that they couldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>around other people because they were </v>

1943
01:29:11.151 --> 01:29:13.671
<v Speaker 3>afraid of harming those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see the transformation take </v>

1944
01:29:13.671 --> 01:29:18.021
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become more peaceful and more self </v>

1945
01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:18.021
<v Speaker 3>aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not even the whole,</v>

1946
01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1947
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:20.790
<v Speaker 3>they're just filming a little portion of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for the documentary.</v>

1948
01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these guys are doing it </v>

1949
01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting stuff.</v>

1950
01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't see how a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're one of those people who's </v>

1951
01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:32.391
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this should be walled off from </v>

1952
01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:32.391
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's medical benefit happening,</v>

1953
01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

1954
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people that should be walled off,</v>

1955
01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:35.490
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1956
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Where's the bodies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1957
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.840
<v Speaker 1>This one kid died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1958
01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>no one has any idea what their kid died </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1959
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And don't</v>

1960
01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 3>all shady towns in South America by </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself as a little teenager asking </v>

1961
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 3>where the software is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Iwatch</v>

1962
01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 1>like at high out of my mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is going to take advantage of </v>

1963
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1964
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>

1965
01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.320
<v Speaker 1>That was the Tldr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened was that now I'm just,</v>

1966
01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm making it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did somebody do something to </v>

1967
01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:01.420
<v Speaker 1>somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They prove it.</v>

1968
01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>They found they found a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1969
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.700
<v Speaker 1>He might've been murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really don't know,</v>

1970
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:10.270
<v Speaker 1>and this idea that you have to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America only exists because it's </v>

1971
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:14.111
<v Speaker 1>illegal in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid you can be doing at </v>

1972
01:30:14.111 --> 01:30:16.751
<v Speaker 1>Columbia University if they would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these things off of schedule </v>

1973
01:30:16.751 --> 01:30:16.751
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:30:16.751 --> 01:30:19.280
<v Speaker 1>If you do DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially doing the most potent</v>

1975
01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:24.050
<v Speaker 1>form of the drug and Sin Iowasca if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke it and when you do that,</v>

1976
01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to be anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seen to be somewhere where you </v>

1977
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter where you are,</v>

1978
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going somewhere else.</v>

1979
01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You're going to another fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

1980
01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1981
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not like something like you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in South America to hit that spot.</v>

1982
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1983
01:30:37.101 --> 01:30:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get there in 15 seconds.</v>

1984
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:42.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not far away at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1985
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:45.740
<v Speaker 1>it's the most disturbing aspect of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accessibility.</v>

1986
01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you smoke it,</v>

1987
01:30:47.271 --> 01:30:49.030
<v Speaker 1>the accessibility of this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

1988
01:30:49.031 --> 01:30:54.031
<v Speaker 1>so bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean probably even more intense if you </v>

1989
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:56.270
<v Speaker 1>do it in this ancient indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

1990
01:30:56.271 --> 01:31:01.271
<v Speaker 1>you're in the jungle and you're freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and South America and he's blowing </v>

1991
01:31:01.271 --> 01:31:02.510
<v Speaker 1>smoke on you and you're here in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars and shit.</v>

1992
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to try that out sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>

1993
01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:10.210
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's places that are doing it now in </v>

1994
01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:12.011
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's places that are doing it in the </v>

1995
01:31:12.011 --> 01:31:12.011
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1996
01:31:12.011 --> 01:31:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I might go to the budget and I might go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the budget route.</v>

1997
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Then California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you mean you have to worry about </v>

1998
01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.010
<v Speaker 1>some things happening everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1999
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 1>especially you go someplace and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to trust all these people and you're </v>

2000
01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:25.640
<v Speaker 1>getting blasted out of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you think about how many people</v>

2001
01:31:25.641 --> 01:31:29.930
<v Speaker 1>are doing it now and you think about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many bad reports are coming back,</v>

2002
01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly fairly low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With women,</v>

2003
01:31:32.781 --> 01:31:36.830
<v Speaker 1>they have to worry more because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyon,</v>

2004
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:40.490
<v Speaker 1>she had an issue with a guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing her while she was under.</v>

2005
01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a shaman who had to flee the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene apparently,</v>

2006
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:46.460
<v Speaker 1>but he had done that to other women as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2007
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman,</v>

2008
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:53.291
<v Speaker 1>you have to worry about that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit about some creepy dude who's doing </v>

2009
01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:53.690
<v Speaker 1>weird things to people when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>

2010
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess he would have to worry about</v>

2011
01:31:55.641 --> 01:31:57.080
<v Speaker 1>that as a dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2012
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:59.480
<v Speaker 1>if you got the wrong shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

2013
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to wake</v>

2014
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.530
<v Speaker 3>up without a couple of organs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

2015
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2016
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:07.141
<v Speaker 5>what it is is it's become a popular </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and when it's become a popular </v>

2017
01:32:07.141 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 5>thing is going to be people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalize on that.</v>

2018
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.740
<v Speaker 5>There's so much money involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These IOWASCA tours,</v>

2019
01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 5>people are doing them in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2020
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 5>every person's spending thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars and you're getting,</v>

2021
01:32:15.761 --> 01:32:17.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 people at trip and Woohoo,</v>

2022
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking raking it in.</v>

2023
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.200
<v Speaker 3>And the CNN documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were interviewing one of the local </v>

2024
01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.120
<v Speaker 3>white experts and he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't buy this stuff at the marketplaces</v>

2025
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:27.500
<v Speaker 3>because you just don't know what's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2026
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:28.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

2027
01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.010
<v Speaker 3>some person trying to make money off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a tourist.</v>

2028
01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>That's not the authentic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2029
01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:34.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That definitely can happen,</v>

2030
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:40.340
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that you have to go all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to South America for an experience </v>

2031
01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:43.110
<v Speaker 5>that should be legal everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world is fucking stupid.</v>

2032
01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.720
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mind numbingly stupid.</v>

2033
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:50.730
<v Speaker 5>It makes me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid that we have to go to </v>

2034
01:32:50.730 --> 01:32:51.960
<v Speaker 5>these countries that have different laws</v>
<v Speaker 5>because on this patch of dirt,</v>

2035
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:56.990
<v Speaker 5>they can lock you up and Iowasca is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird gray area too because it's not </v>

2036
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:58.410
<v Speaker 5>totally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not legal,</v>

2037
01:32:58.411 --> 01:33:00.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's not illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're not extracting it.</v>

2038
01:33:00.601 --> 01:33:05.601
<v Speaker 5>If you extract dmt from the same plants </v>
<v Speaker 5>that make Iowasca and you do the </v>

2039
01:33:05.601 --> 01:33:07.860
<v Speaker 5>powdered form of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you have to smoke to get into your</v>

2040
01:33:07.861 --> 01:33:09.840
<v Speaker 5>bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's illegal.</v>

2041
01:33:10.050 --> 01:33:15.050
<v Speaker 5>That's schedule one drug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See the fact that all the planets but </v>

2042
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 5>hold on site,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all the plants that are there that </v>

2043
01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:18.660
<v Speaker 5>comprise Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you mix them together,</v>

2044
01:33:18.661 --> 01:33:22.800
<v Speaker 5>they're all legal on their own and </v>
<v Speaker 5>combining them together.</v>

2045
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:27.801
<v Speaker 5>They're still legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the drug that you're actually </v>

2046
01:33:27.801 --> 01:33:31.461
<v Speaker 5>drinking is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a very gray area because they </v>

2047
01:33:31.461 --> 01:33:34.941
<v Speaker 5>don't have laws on all the different </v>
<v Speaker 5>plants are so many fucking plants and </v>

2048
01:33:34.941 --> 01:33:37.290
<v Speaker 5>it's not exactly an extraction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like a chemical extraction,</v>

2049
01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:39.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're making a stew.</v>

2050
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just strikes me as so disingenuous </v>

2051
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.491
<v Speaker 3>how people have to sneak around like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and deal with the specific,</v>

2052
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:51.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2053
01:33:51.261 --> 01:33:53.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuances of the law.</v>

2054
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it just shows you how dishonest the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government is.</v>

2055
01:33:55.761 --> 01:34:00.761
<v Speaker 3>It should be like if you're paying your </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes and you're not staging some kind </v>

2056
01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:03.380
<v Speaker 3>of insurrection at a walmart and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a threat to anybody,</v>

2057
01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:08.650
<v Speaker 3>you should be left the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that should include like you should </v>

2058
01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:09.620
<v Speaker 3>have access to certain mind expensing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind expanding substances.</v>

2059
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:14.970
<v Speaker 5>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will more now than ever before and </v>

2060
01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.870
<v Speaker 5>more five years from now than now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on the way.</v>

2061
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you could stop it at this</v>
<v Speaker 5>point in time.</v>

2062
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 5>Too many people are talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive benefits of it.</v>

2063
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:27.121
<v Speaker 5>They're doing stories on CNN about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and much like marijuana has become </v>

2064
01:34:27.121 --> 01:34:31.770
<v Speaker 5>accepted slowly but surely across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country where I don't care if they do </v>

2065
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:31.770
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just keep it away from me.</v>

2066
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:33.220
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of.</v>

2067
01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:35.200
<v Speaker 5>Well the let those fucking dopers have </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2068
01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:37.240
<v Speaker 5>but this way get tax money from it.</v>

2069
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I feel about almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2070
01:34:38.970 --> 01:34:39.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them do it.</v>

2071
01:34:39.721 --> 01:34:44.721
<v Speaker 3>Just keep it away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why isn't that the approach to </v>

2072
01:34:44.721 --> 01:34:44.721
<v Speaker 3>almost anything that's not harmful?</v>

2073
01:34:44.721 --> 01:34:44.721
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be.</v>

2074
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.010
<v Speaker 5>It's just like it should be legal to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tattoo your face.</v>

2075
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:52.030
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really want to put stars over </v>

2076
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.030
<v Speaker 5>your forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck is supposed to stop you do whatever</v>

2077
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.590
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't advise it,</v>

2078
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.340
<v Speaker 5>but you know when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like marijuana or psychedelics,</v>

2079
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's long history of people that have</v>

2080
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 5>stories of the positive benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these experiences,</v>

2081
01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 5>so deny those from people and to deny it</v>
<v Speaker 5>without any personal experience of those</v>

2082
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.400
<v Speaker 5>of those drugs on your own is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous because you don't know what </v>

2083
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.440
<v Speaker 5>you're making illegal like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2084
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.460
<v Speaker 5>You're listening to what you listening </v>
<v Speaker 5>to folk stories about a powder that </v>

2085
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 5>steers your stole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>steals your soul,</v>

2086
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:21.220
<v Speaker 5>like what do you what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2087
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:24.360
<v Speaker 5>What's what are you basing this on when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're basing it on a schedule,</v>

2088
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:29.380
<v Speaker 5>one drug schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one drug that your liver makes a </v>

2089
01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 5>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one drug that's made in your lungs,</v>

2090
01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:36.300
<v Speaker 5>a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one drug that's made by your pineal </v>

2091
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:36.300
<v Speaker 5>glands.</v>

2092
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:36.300
<v Speaker 5>All little silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body's making drugs.</v>

2094
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Schedule One drugs so you can get </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrested for your body makes your body's</v>

2095
01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.560
<v Speaker 5>a drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body's a fucking whore with intent </v>

2096
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.511
<v Speaker 5>to distribute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dumb and it's only allowed because </v>

2097
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:54.911
<v Speaker 5>it's been allowed for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we had to start from scratch today </v>

2098
01:35:54.911 --> 01:35:55.790
<v Speaker 5>and make an appraisal over what is </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous,</v>

2099
01:35:55.791 --> 01:36:00.791
<v Speaker 5>not dangerous for society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd have to have a serious </v>

2100
01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:02.921
<v Speaker 5>consideration about prescription drugs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a serious consideration about </v>

2101
01:36:02.921 --> 01:36:03.150
<v Speaker 5>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the really big ones we to.</v>

2102
01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:08.220
<v Speaker 5>We'd have to really look at the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people that die every year from </v>

2103
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.310
<v Speaker 5>prescription drugs and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 5>problematic there.</v>

2104
01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.320
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of people that get addicted </v>

2105
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:14.320
<v Speaker 5>to prescription drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2106
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.831
<v Speaker 5>very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of people that just want </v>

2107
01:36:17.831 --> 01:36:17.831
<v Speaker 5>prescription drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ask for them,</v>

2108
01:36:17.831 --> 01:36:20.270
<v Speaker 5>they complain about pains that might not</v>
<v Speaker 5>even be there.</v>

2109
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 5>They exaggerate pains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might have psychological issues and</v>

2110
01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:26.000
<v Speaker 5>these people will legitimate physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>ailments,</v>

2111
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:31.360
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of crazy people out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there hopped up on pain pills too and </v>

2112
01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 5>they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dropping like flies.</v>

2113
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 5>Thousands and thousands of them every </v>
<v Speaker 5>year.</v>

2114
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:39.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we thought nine slash 11 was a big deal </v>

2115
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.430
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine slash 11 was awful.</v>

2116
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:40.010
<v Speaker 5>3,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people died.</v>

2117
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:45.050
<v Speaker 5>It was like 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people die every year from drugs and </v>

2118
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:48.281
<v Speaker 5>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like alcohol overdoses or like </v>

2119
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:48.281
<v Speaker 5>something around 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2120
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 5>Prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the prescription drug deaths?</v>

2121
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 5>If you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just get add tobacco and you go up</v>

2122
01:36:53.211 --> 01:36:54.450
<v Speaker 5>by like 400,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2123
01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go up by maybe even as much as half </v>

2124
01:36:59.650 --> 01:36:59.650
<v Speaker 5>a million just in North America alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2125
01:36:59.650 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 5>how many would you think prescription </v>
<v Speaker 5>drug deaths every year.</v>

2126
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 5>Let's guess you said $100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said $100,000</v>

2127
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 5>with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With alcohol.</v>

2128
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go with 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>just from prescriptions.</v>

2129
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think?</v>

2130
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.710
<v Speaker 5>If you had to say I was gonna say way </v>
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

2131
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:17.930
<v Speaker 5>but 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>sound does sound like a lot.</v>

2132
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:20.050
<v Speaker 5>So I'll go with 50 to under.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cut It.</v>

2133
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:25.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying it's probably going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>around $25,000.</v>

2134
01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fact Sheet,</v>

2135
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:32.891
<v Speaker 5>prescription drug overdose in the United</v>
<v Speaker 5>States facts sheet each day in the </v>

2136
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>114 people die from drug overdoses.</v>

2137
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:45.250
<v Speaker 5>Another 6,748</v>
<v Speaker 5>are treated in emergency and emergency </v>

2138
01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:45.740
<v Speaker 5>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

2139
01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 5>So out of 7,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less than 7,000,</v>

2140
01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 5>6,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>900,</v>

2141
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 5>6,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>800 plus people</v>

2142
01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 1>that overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So only 114 people die everyday though.</v>

2143
01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty impressive though.</v>

2144
01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>

2145
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:08.751
<v Speaker 1>Doctors versus marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero deaths per day from.</v>

2146
01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no one's.</v>

2147
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.610
<v Speaker 1>No one's arguing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty high and that's,</v>

2148
01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:18.700
<v Speaker 1>that's 314 people a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred days.</v>

2149
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:23.910
<v Speaker 1>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2000.</v>

2150
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:28.911
<v Speaker 1>Twelve to 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drug overdose deaths were related to </v>

2151
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:36.531
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty 1000 drug overdose deaths over a </v>

2152
01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:37.620
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what that means.</v>

2153
01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 1>So 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 were pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

2154
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2155
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 1>slightly less than 20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was something else.</v>

2156
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck they were.</v>

2157
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.120
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2158
01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it is in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point 4 million people had visited </v>

2159
01:39:01.321 --> 01:39:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the emergency room for nonmedical use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals.</v>

2160
01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people misusing their actions,</v>

2161
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:13.590
<v Speaker 1>they're freaked out and went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency room nod,</v>

2162
01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:15.650
<v Speaker 1>non medicinal use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2163
01:39:15.651 --> 01:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they borrowed somebody's pills.</v>

2164
01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're weird man.</v>

2165
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how much people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change their state.</v>

2166
01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we're talking about,</v>

2167
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca being able to help people and </v>

2168
01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:33.501
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to show people new states of </v>

2169
01:39:33.501 --> 01:39:36.450
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and new ways of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his fucking really weird that human</v>

2170
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:41.451
<v Speaker 1>beings need that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to alter our perception </v>

2171
01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:41.451
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2172
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.500
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a weird animal.</v>

2173
01:39:43.650 --> 01:39:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Like an animal that alters its </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception by what it puts into its </v>

2174
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.380
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't just exist like say like</v>

2175
01:39:49.381 --> 01:39:52.520
<v Speaker 1>a cheetah or a bear or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2176
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.060
<v Speaker 1>an eagle now.</v>

2177
01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Now we exist and we change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We move her and we think we know how </v>

2178
01:39:59.240 --> 01:39:59.670
<v Speaker 4>important consciousness is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2179
01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.010
<v Speaker 4>We were the only ones that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>

2180
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:05.610
<v Speaker 4>Like even this conversation I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>confidently say at least on my end would</v>

2181
01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 4>not be as good without drinking less </v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>

2182
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:08.290
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2183
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm making use of chemicals right now.</v>

2184
01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe a little bit.</v>

2185
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love to change.</v>

2186
01:40:17.691 --> 01:40:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Our state is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2187
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>a few animals do in some animals drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fermented juices and monkeys get </v>

2188
01:40:24.141 --> 01:40:24.680
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rent.</v>

2189
01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll find like berries and things </v>

2190
01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.541
<v Speaker 1>that have been fermented fruits that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermented and they'll drink that and </v>

2191
01:40:31.541 --> 01:40:32.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2193
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:36.140
<v Speaker 1>people have this weird desire changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>their state,</v>

2194
01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but the also I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2195
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.490
<v Speaker 1>we look at what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2196
01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.200
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2197
01:40:42.201 --> 01:40:47.201
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you're essentially doing when </v>

2198
01:40:47.201 --> 01:40:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you're changing your state is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using technology.</v>

2199
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 1>You're using information that has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed on from generation to generation</v>

2200
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:59.460
<v Speaker 5>where people figured out techniques to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do like a pharmacological intervention </v>

2201
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:05.791
<v Speaker 5>on your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We figured out a way to combine this </v>

2202
01:41:05.791 --> 01:41:08.821
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way to fucking take the grapes and </v>

2203
01:41:08.821 --> 01:41:08.821
<v Speaker 5>you smash them and then you stuff in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>barrel.</v>

2204
01:41:08.821 --> 01:41:09.230
<v Speaker 5>You let it sit for six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2205
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:14.610
<v Speaker 5>all this was all like concocted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are all like solutions to dealing </v>

2206
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:20.191
<v Speaker 5>with the problems of the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problems of mundane consciousness </v>

2207
01:41:20.191 --> 01:41:24.961
<v Speaker 5>and the problems of like getting stuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>in patterns where we knew even just </v>

2208
01:41:24.961 --> 01:41:26.620
<v Speaker 5>getting drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting drunk.</v>

2209
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes we'll reset a pattern and make</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at things in a better way.</v>

2210
01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Like you could have like a bad breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go out with your friends,</v>

2211
01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 5>you get drunk and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2212
01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:37.680
<v Speaker 5>I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He crash,</v>

2213
01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:42.730
<v Speaker 5>lie in your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It heads fucking spinning your beds or </v>

2214
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:42.730
<v Speaker 5>you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2215
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:46.491
<v Speaker 5>your head's throbbing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you had a bit of a change of </v>

2216
01:41:46.491 --> 01:41:50.641
<v Speaker 5>perception like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you use that shamanic ritual of going </v>

2217
01:41:50.641 --> 01:41:55.501
<v Speaker 5>out and getting hammered and doing shots</v>
<v Speaker 5>with your friends to bond and to have an</v>

2218
01:41:55.810 --> 01:42:00.010
<v Speaker 5>altered state of perception and altered </v>
<v Speaker 5>state of how you view the world.</v>

2219
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2220
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:04.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people have that all the time.</v>

2221
01:42:04.011 --> 01:42:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Like I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the,</v>

2222
01:42:06.441 --> 01:42:08.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inception aspect of,</v>

2223
01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.540
<v Speaker 3>of doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2224
01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:15.190
<v Speaker 3>mind altering substances where if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can change the way you think about </v>

2225
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:15.500
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually does.</v>

2226
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 3>This sounds a little trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it changes physical reality because </v>

2227
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:21.770
<v Speaker 3>then you start to act in this new way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People pick up on it,</v>

2228
01:42:21.771 --> 01:42:22.400
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

2229
01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 3>this is working out for David Seaman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll act in this new way and be </v>

2230
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.390
<v Speaker 3>less of this kind of person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just kind of becomes contagious.</v>

2231
01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:34.420
<v Speaker 3>And the example of that that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently was going through a Tsa </v>

2232
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.111
<v Speaker 3>checkpoint already extremely high just </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see kind of how I dealt with it.</v>

2233
01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:43.151
<v Speaker 3>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that kind of pressure just fades </v>

2234
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:43.430
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I was like taking out my wallet,</v>

2235
01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I was like sorting through my cards and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just taking my sweet ass time,</v>

2236
01:42:46.791 --> 01:42:51.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like totally oblivious to the fact that </v>

2237
01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:51.791
<v Speaker 3>there's like this machine there that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to keep you,</v>

2238
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just moving forward in everything so </v>

2239
01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 3>secure and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2240
01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 3>we're screening people out.</v>

2241
01:42:56.930 --> 01:43:01.700
<v Speaker 3>And what I noticed was that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really all just one big ritual.</v>

2242
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:05.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Shaman patting you on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head before you go into the hut,</v>

2243
01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:08.810
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to make people not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified before they enter an airport.</v>

2244
01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Like you're in the safe zone now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once I had that realization that all</v>

2245
01:43:12.861 --> 01:43:17.861
<v Speaker 3>of this is fucking theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're not really trying to </v>

2246
01:43:17.861 --> 01:43:20.471
<v Speaker 3>oppress you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just trying to do this thing </v>

2247
01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:20.471
<v Speaker 3>very quickly to make people feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been.</v>

2248
01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:22.090
<v Speaker 3>They've been screened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>

2249
01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.720
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

2250
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:28.870
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made the animosity that I had </v>

2251
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.300
<v Speaker 3>retained go away because I saw that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of my anger over the inefficiencies </v>

2252
01:43:31.521 --> 01:43:33.320
<v Speaker 3>of the surveillance state and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2253
01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 3>these fucking people asking me to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>off my shoes take off my shoes are just </v>

2254
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.420
<v Speaker 3>workers and in fact I can have fun with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2255
01:43:41.421 --> 01:43:43.550
<v Speaker 3>We can have a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be friendly.</v>

2256
01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:44.660
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to be dicks about it.</v>

2257
01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2258
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.040
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunate that we think that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>need something like that.</v>

2259
01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:51.840
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

2260
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>is incredibly wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous because all of the,</v>

2261
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>all of the medicine is happening behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenes.</v>

2262
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>It's intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know before you enter that airport,</v>

2263
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:05.050
<v Speaker 1>if you are a threat or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they should and take off your </v>

2264
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:05.050
<v Speaker 1>belt and take off your shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not.</v>

2265
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing about going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the TSA is when they break character,</v>

2266
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have like a lot of urban folk </v>

2267
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:14.320
<v Speaker 1>working there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2268
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.220
<v Speaker 1>there was three of them the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>

2269
01:44:16.221 --> 01:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

2301
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just sad when you see like old </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go through it.</v>

2302
01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You see like some old dude with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible hunch in his back and he's </v>

2303
01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 1>going to get out of his wheelchair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shuffle over and stand there.</v>

2304
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I watched some lady the other day do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think she was going to be able </v>

2305
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:56.701
<v Speaker 1>to get out of her wheelchair and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made her walk through that stupid </v>

2306
01:45:56.701 --> 01:45:56.840
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing and hold their hands up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

2317
01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the numbers when it comes to things </v>

<v Speaker 1>Flying is one of the safest,</v>

2320
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.500
<v Speaker 1>one of these single safest things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do in a lot of ways.</v>

2321
01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:38.820

<v Speaker 1>and they have to.</v>

2336
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>The restaurant has to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this lady's dog is an emotional </v>

2337
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

2345
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:45.480

<v Speaker 1>It's hygiene issues that we're bypassing</v>

2346
01:47:45.481 --> 01:47:47.820
<v Speaker 1>hygiene issues for one person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your teeth are going to turn yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your liver is going to fall out of your </v>

2383
01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:27.980
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2384
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 1>your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go black.</v>

2385
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:32.130
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to walk upstairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

2386
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.000
<v Speaker 1>but you look like a rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll look cool as fuck.</v>

2387
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Sign me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>

2388
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:44.811
<v Speaker 1>When I see kids still smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a 14 year old kid the other day </v>

2389
01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:44.811
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to look cool.</v>

2390
01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Just holding a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2391
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you fucking dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you not know?</v>

2392
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care.</v>

2393
01:49:51.130 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 1>They just in their desire to look cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their desire to be upset.</v>

2394
01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:57.370
<v Speaker 1>That's like another thing about smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

2395
01:49:57.371 --> 01:50:02.371
<v Speaker 1>People love to smoke cigarettes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost justifies their shitty </v>

2396
01:50:02.371 --> 01:50:06.631
<v Speaker 1>attitude they love to do is sit back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2397
01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:12.331
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to fucking suck on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette and try to calm me down </v>

2398
01:50:12.331 --> 01:50:13.210
<v Speaker 1>because we've got to get these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders filled out.</v>

2399
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's this idea that I'm busy,</v>

2400
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care about my body.</v>

2401
01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Got I got a lot of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaga,</v>

2402
01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:26.581
<v Speaker 1>last dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it reinforces this ridiculous </v>

2403
01:50:26.581 --> 01:50:27.610
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2404
01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:32.611
<v Speaker 1>Life of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous life of just trying to </v>

2405
01:50:32.611 --> 01:50:34.690
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so much work to do that be caskey</v>

2406
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:39.691
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking life.</v>

2407
01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Just the insane pattern that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in getting up in the morning,</v>

2408
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:51.930
<v Speaker 1>having a couple with your cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a cigarette in your mouth when </v>

2409
01:50:51.930 --> 01:50:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you're running out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light in that bitch up,</v>

2410
01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.360
<v Speaker 1>driving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing it out the window.</v>

2411
01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 1>As you're driving down the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightened up.</v>

2412
01:50:57.731 --> 01:51:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Another one you fuckhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's us.</v>

2413
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:06.390
<v Speaker 1>People goofy as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get extra work breaks too for </v>

2414
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:10.231
<v Speaker 1>smoking and it becomes an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean they get extra work </v>

2415
01:51:10.231 --> 01:51:13.831
<v Speaker 1>breaks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that they get some </v>

2416
01:51:13.831 --> 01:51:15.961
<v Speaker 1>workplaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow people to extra work breaks </v>

2417
01:51:15.961 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 1>if you smoke because they'll become </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritated and become really.</v>

2418
01:51:17.051 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2419
01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and nonsmokers get pissed and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2420
01:51:20.321 --> 01:51:25.321
<v Speaker 1>And restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big thing because a lot of </v>

2421
01:51:25.321 --> 01:51:25.321
<v Speaker 1>servers are smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lifestyle for a young person</v>

2422
01:51:25.321 --> 01:51:26.890
<v Speaker 1>and becomes a huge issue in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2423
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird that,</v>

2424
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.560
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird that employers would sort </v>

2425
01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.921
<v Speaker 1>of bend to that because if you can hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in when you were flying on a flight </v>

2426
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.840
<v Speaker 1>from La to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you have to.</v>

2427
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:42.940
<v Speaker 1>How come we can't hold it in while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working?</v>

2428
01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously you can zoom in for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2429
01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:54.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to step outside and nobody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to carry your load while you're out </v>

2430
01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.450
<v Speaker 1>there killing yourself slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be the least favorite bar back</v>

2431
01:51:55.451 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 1>probably at some dive bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My con can imagine.</v>

2432
01:51:58.540 --> 01:51:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably all do it.</v>

2433
01:51:59.770 --> 01:52:04.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about dive bars is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a good percentage of people </v>

2434
01:52:04.770 --> 01:52:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that are killing themselves slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2435
01:52:04.770 --> 01:52:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So they're all team effort right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:09.250
<v Speaker 1>They used to be places that violated </v>
<v Speaker 1>California's law.</v>

2437
01:52:09.251 --> 01:52:14.251
<v Speaker 1>When they first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a few places that were </v>

2438
01:52:14.251 --> 01:52:14.320
<v Speaker 1>allowing people to still smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give a fuck,</v>

2439
01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:19.321
<v Speaker 1>but they just got heavy fines and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually gave up the of those smoker </v>

2440
01:52:19.321 --> 01:52:20.320
<v Speaker 1>patio still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2441
01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.680
<v Speaker 1>which are just as gross know if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be outside.</v>

2442
01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:28.860
<v Speaker 1>In Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they built rooms and a lot of places </v>

2443
01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like a permanent tent with heaters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>

2444
01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 1>It just became an extension of their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have it now.</v>

2445
01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Their bar suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense,</v>

2446
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but are you allowed to smoke other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things out there like cigars or a pipe </v>

2447
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.320
<v Speaker 1>out there with a fucking show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lailey big,</v>

2448
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 1>big sherlock pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pontificate about the universe.</v>

2449
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a steakhouse in New York City.</v>

2450
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Keens steakhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had been there?</v>

2451
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest pipe section of the walls.</v>

2452
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that put those pipes under the</v>

2453
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>old pipes from the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever the late 18 hundreds.</v>

2454
01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Well don't the pipes like represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that came there.</v>

2455
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Then they would own their own pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when like they have a pipe that was </v>

2456
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.690
<v Speaker 1>owned by Teddy Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one owned by,</v>

2457
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I think Mark Twain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just always ridiculous.</v>

2458
01:53:10.431 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>People would come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would request their pipe,</v>

2459
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.320
<v Speaker 1>smoke it at dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Einstein had a pipe there.</v>

2460
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:20.590
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if there's any photos of people </v>

2461
01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:21.880
<v Speaker 1>smoking their pipes at that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I always wonder like that.</v>

2462
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Do they smoke those pipes or those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipes?</v>

2463
01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2464
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:28.370
<v Speaker 1>like oh I got brass hat that you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinned to the wall.</v>

2465
01:53:28.371 --> 01:53:33.371
<v Speaker 1>This is David Seaman's hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think back in the day those fuckers </v>

2466
01:53:33.371 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 1>smoked them because I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2467
01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:36.620
<v Speaker 1>they're all in all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be men's only.</v>

2468
01:53:36.621 --> 01:53:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I was watching it on tv an old days til </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 19.</v>

2469
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh five or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a men's club.</v>

2470
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave go there.</v>

2471
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:44.720
<v Speaker 1>No broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big piece of steak.</v>

2472
01:53:44.721 --> 01:53:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Can I have a fucking meal and smoke a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe the good old days.</v>

2473
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman sued them,</v>

2474
01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:54.230
<v Speaker 1>some actress back in 19 something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they opened it up to everybody.</v>

2475
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2476
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:58.420
<v Speaker 1>didn't they do that recently with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>curves joint?</v>

2477
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 1>The women's only gym did a guy when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined curves,</v>

2478
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure a guy got upset and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

2479
01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to join curves.</v>

2480
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I want curves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my hips are too.</v>

2481
01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn your exercises.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Be a of curves.</v>

2483
01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2484
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it was ruled that you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't have a men's only club,</v>

2485
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a women's only club </v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

2486
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.370
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2487
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:27.920
<v Speaker 1>S whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>

2488
01:54:27.921 --> 01:54:30.770

<v Speaker 1>Like leave him alone.</v>

2489
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to think with women </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothering men.</v>

2490
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:35.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get into get into </v>

<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to have all women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes in places,</v>

2493
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because especially when you're dealing </v>

01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:48.131
<v Speaker 1>with like exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some women don't want to be fucking </v>

2495
01:54:48.131 --> 01:54:50.120
<v Speaker 1>ogled by some shithead behind them while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing downward dog for sure.</v>

2496
01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2497
01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.590
<v Speaker 1>But my point is why would you want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're not wanted?</v>

2498
01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2499
01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:58.490
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about like whites only</v>
<v Speaker 1>or blacks only.</v>

2500
01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.980
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about people that fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2501
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:06.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with sex and we're </v>

2502
01:55:06.190 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 1>dealing with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People should be allowed to get the fuck</v>

2503
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:09.620
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have like a,</v>

2504
01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>like an area where no one's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

2505
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have like a Freebie,</v>

2506
01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 1>a base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm free here,</v>

2507
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:19.430
<v Speaker 1>like this is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a safe base.</v>

2508
01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Like in like for a man to get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2509
01:55:22.851 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 1>women want to have a place where men </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't allowed to go.</v>

2510
01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for women to get upset,</v>

2511
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:32.240
<v Speaker 1>unless men are plotting women's doom </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind those doors,</v>

2512
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>like why would you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to be in that room where</v>

2513
01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:36.920
<v Speaker 1>they only wanted to be men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to go in there?</v>

2514
01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Because they got really good steak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipes in the case of keen can't keep </v>

2515
01:55:42.210 --> 01:55:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that away from women forever so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they got</v>

2516
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.490
<v Speaker 5>to go there before they got to vote </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when did women get the vote?</v>

2517
01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:50.140
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the teens right?</v>

2518
01:55:50.150 --> 01:55:53.750
<v Speaker 4>Like 1915 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone was to look that one up,</v>

2519
01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:59.260
<v Speaker 4>so teens gave in before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're more progressive than our </v>

2520
01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:03.281
<v Speaker 4>country was about choosing the president</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some ways that steakhouse is more </v>

2521
01:56:03.281 --> 01:56:04.130
<v Speaker 4>progressive than any other part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2522
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:05.000
<v Speaker 4>You don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2523
01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I've been changing my feeling about </v>
<v Speaker 4>president slightly and now I think I </v>

2524
01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:14.471
<v Speaker 4>will only vote for a woman president </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think women should have a </v>

2525
01:56:14.471 --> 01:56:16.520
<v Speaker 4>chance to fuck this thing up to first of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2526
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:19.430
<v Speaker 4>and we should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should be able to prove by a woman.</v>

2527
01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:22.220
<v Speaker 4>If a woman gets an office and the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same things happened,</v>

2528
01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:23.750
<v Speaker 4>then we can go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2529
01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.270
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one really gets a say.</v>

2530
01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:28.310
<v Speaker 4>They get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we should just run through like,</v>

2531
01:56:28.311 --> 01:56:29.480
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got a black guy,</v>

2532
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Elizabeth Warren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

2533
01:56:31.641 --> 01:56:36.641
<v Speaker 4>she seems very intelligent for a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that once we can establish that </v>

2534
01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:37.820
<v Speaker 4>they're all corrupt and they all get </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupted,</v>

2535
01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 4>that everybody's corrupt or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll find out that like it's a </v>

2536
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:44.540
<v Speaker 4>good idea to have a woman run things </v>
<v Speaker 4>because women aren't more.</v>

2537
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:49.600
<v Speaker 4>They're not as inclined start wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we've already gotten the Margaret </v>

2538
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Thatcher's and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2539
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I think women can get.</v>

2540
01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.130
<v Speaker 5>She wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

2541
01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:57.420
<v Speaker 5>that's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's England's completely different </v>

2542
01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:57.420
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2543
01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:00.461
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in America there's never been a </v>

2544
01:57:00.461 --> 01:57:02.450
<v Speaker 5>prominent political leader other than </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton.</v>

2545
01:57:02.451 --> 01:57:07.220
<v Speaker 5>That's a woman and she and she never </v>
<v Speaker 5>really quite reached any level of,</v>

2546
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:08.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2547
01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:11.000
<v Speaker 5>she was never running things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2548
01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:16.060
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was never a governor of a major </v>

2549
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:16.060
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was never a,</v>

2550
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:16.850
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she,</v>

2551
01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:22.050
<v Speaker 5>what she did was she married one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>greatest presidents ever went through </v>

2552
01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:25.880
<v Speaker 5>that whole thing and now she has a job </v>
<v Speaker 5>working for the president and would like</v>

2553
01:57:25.881 --> 01:57:28.880
<v Speaker 5>to run for president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's her or Elizabeth Warren or.</v>

2554
01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:34.300
<v Speaker 5>My thinking is if every country was run </v>
<v Speaker 5>by checks.</v>

2555
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much less war and how much less.</v>

2556
01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.360
<v Speaker 5>Like how much less imperialism when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have how much less money grabs,</v>

2557
01:57:45.110 --> 01:57:50.110
<v Speaker 5>how much less it will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the decisions to like international </v>

2558
01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:50.210
<v Speaker 5>shit was all being done by women.</v>

2559
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go with 25 to 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>less now.</v>

2560
01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be interesting though.</v>

2561
01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.710
<v Speaker 5>Seems to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2562
01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm not patronizing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

2563
01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:59.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2564
01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:00.920
<v Speaker 5>I was really thinking about this the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>

2565
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:06.250
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking if you look at the issues</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people have when it comes to </v>

2566
01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:08.480
<v Speaker 5>whatever the president does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's always two big ones.</v>

2567
01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Financial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>

2568
01:58:10.610 --> 01:58:12.350
<v Speaker 5>And military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the,</v>

2569
01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:15.530
<v Speaker 5>those are two big issues that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>always have with whatever president has.</v>

2570
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:21.310
<v Speaker 5>And I think that women would be less </v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to cause the military issues.</v>

2571
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:27.910
<v Speaker 5>That's just a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think there are less aggressive </v>

2572
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.910
<v Speaker 5>by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're more maternal.</v>

2573
01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:29.090
<v Speaker 5>They have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2574
01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the ones who become mothers.</v>

2575
01:58:32.121 --> 01:58:37.121
<v Speaker 5>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea of conquering is a very male </v>

2576
01:58:37.121 --> 01:58:37.121
<v Speaker 5>idea,</v>

2577
01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.490
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'll.</v>

2578
01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 4>I think the adversarial power thing just</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

2579
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:47.250
<v Speaker 5>If you're somebody who likes to rise in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ranks of power and it might be one </v>

2580
01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:49.280
<v Speaker 5>of those things where it doesn't care so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much about your gender may be more,</v>

2581
01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:51.100
<v Speaker 5>but we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can test it out.</v>

2582
01:58:51.101 --> 01:58:53.620
<v Speaker 5>We can try it out over the next 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 5>and see what happens.</v>

2583
01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:59.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously I don't think that it should </v>

2584
01:58:59.280 --> 01:58:59.280
<v Speaker 5>be only women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2585
01:58:59.280 --> 01:58:59.380
<v Speaker 5>I think that would feel if a guy came </v>
<v Speaker 5>along that really made sense,</v>

2586
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:03.010
<v Speaker 5>but nobody makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of guy stuff,</v>

2587
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:04.330
<v Speaker 5>I got to use the top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2588
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:05.970
<v Speaker 5>All these motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2589
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 5>also known as they'll have weak </v>
<v Speaker 5>bladders.</v>

2590
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.520
<v Speaker 5>That's part of why we're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

2591
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.520
<v Speaker 5>I feed people coffee and I show them the</v>
<v Speaker 5>weaknesses.</v>

2592
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.910
<v Speaker 5>I show them that they can hang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can't just sit down and talk.</v>

2593
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I'll wait around after the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show's over.</v>

2594
01:59:19.090 --> 01:59:22.600
<v Speaker 5>I'll take pictures with people and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll pay three hours.</v>

2595
01:59:22.601 --> 01:59:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Just doesn't seem like a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me.</v>

2596
01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:28.120
<v Speaker 5>That might be the number one flaw of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this show though.</v>

2597
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:33.390
<v Speaker 5>There might be a time in the future </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I decide the best way to do the </v>

2598
01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:38.791
<v Speaker 5>commercials is to prerecord them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then press play and allow the guest to </v>

2599
01:59:38.791 --> 01:59:43.501
<v Speaker 5>go and pee because it comes a point in </v>
<v Speaker 5>time where I know these motherfuckers </v>

2600
01:59:43.501 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 5>are squirming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I start seeing this shit.</v>

2601
01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I start seeing this sitting up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifting back and they're thinking,</v>

2602
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I say it?</v>

2603
01:59:50.111 --> 01:59:50.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't be a pussy.</v>

2604
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 5>Do I say it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2605
01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:52.960
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2606
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2607

<v Speaker 5>Speaking of which I have to use the </v>

2608
01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:04.141
<v Speaker 5>bathroom.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said it and they go run off to the </v>

2610

<v Speaker 5>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to train their bladder.</v>

2611
02:00:05.881 --> 02:00:09.550
<v Speaker 5>They have to train their discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 5>their desire to podcast.</v>

2612
02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.550
<v Speaker 5>Right now I see a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>tapping out early,</v>

2613

<v Speaker 5>famous and they become more humble and </v>

2631
02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:06.640
<v Speaker 5>more cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's bill burr.</v>

2637
02:01:26.071 --> 02:01:30.301

2638
02:01:30.301 --> 02:01:31.720
<v Speaker 5>bill burr is that once he's become </v>
<v Speaker 5>famous,</v>

2639
02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 5>what he's done is just sort of settle </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2640
02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:36.370
<v Speaker 5>being more comfortable with themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very confident,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He works harder now than ever before.</v>

2642
02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 5>The guy</v>

<v Speaker 1>It has a weakness for coffee.</v>

2650
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what sets it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2651
02:01:56.060 --> 02:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>coffee is a diuretic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does run three too much of it's not </v>

2652
02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:05.381
<v Speaker 1>good either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful with the coffee </v>

2653
02:02:05.381 --> 02:02:05.381
<v Speaker 1>people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking pound of that.</v>

2654
02:02:05.381 --> 02:02:09.731
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the adrenals when you </v>

2655
02:02:09.731 --> 02:02:12.011
<v Speaker 1>drink too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we have a lovely caveman coffee </v>

2656
02:02:12.011 --> 02:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>blend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Single source.</v>

02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Quite delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drinking it black.</v>

2658
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no butter today.</v>

2659
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I think I might be drink drinking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little too much.</v>

2660
02:02:21.561 --> 02:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee.</v>

2661

2662
02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:31.871
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're talking and it's like </v>

2663
02:02:31.871 --> 02:02:31.871
<v Speaker 1>you're tons wrestling with slime.</v>

2664
02:02:31.871 --> 02:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>The inside of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slime.</v>

2665
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Do a warmup exercise before you go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perform.</v>

2666
02:02:36.230 --> 02:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to do stand standup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stretch.</v>

2667
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>So what I'd like to do to stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like bend over,</v>

2668
02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually with my back against the wall </v>

2669
02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>and nobody does anything weird and grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>my ankles and pull my head in between my</v>

2670
02:02:50.421 --> 02:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>legs and stretch my entire spine and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hamstrings.</v>

2671
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And it gets a lot of blood flow to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2672
02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>That helps you voice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2673
02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just go up there and talk.</v>

2676
02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard to talk David Seaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

2677
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to warm up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm going up there and I'm</v>

2678
02:03:07.611 --> 02:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>singing opera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2679
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:11.080

<v Speaker 1>I'll get into those bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

2684
02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I always bring a notebook so I have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mental warmup to go over the notes.</v>

2685
02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:28.610
<v Speaker 1>You got to do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like performing a lot is important,</v>

2686
02:03:28.611 --> 02:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>but just like some of the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects,</v>

2690
02:03:40.781 --> 02:03:40.781
<v Speaker 1>weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was watching.</v>

2691
02:03:40.781 --> 02:03:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries and I'm just trying to not</v>

2692
02:03:44.481 --> 02:03:49.481
<v Speaker 1>even necessarily like actively pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>new material as much as try to expose </v>

2693
02:03:50.211 --> 02:03:55.211
<v Speaker 1>myself to a bunch of things and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas will come and then I sit down and </v>

2694
02:03:55.211 --> 02:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>write and then when I write then more </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas come.</v>

2701
02:04:16.511 --> 02:04:17.180

<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>

2702
02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.080
<v Speaker 1>A Japanese guy has the NASA guy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasa Guy who had a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>women got really upset with that.</v>

2704
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny the things people will get </v>

2705
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:34.400
<v Speaker 1>outraged over and meanwhile it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a constant churn of people being</v>

2706
02:04:34.401 --> 02:04:39.401
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered and parts of the world and </v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck everyone's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2709
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>If they're getting stuffed on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

2710
02:04:45.991 --> 02:04:50.991

<v Speaker 1>not being exploited.</v>

2715
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.260

<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be taken seriously in </v>

2717
02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:10.611
<v Speaker 1>science and you were really serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>about women in science and then here's </v>

2720
02:05:18.241 --> 02:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2721
02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just wear a tee shirt that </v>

2722
02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>says nasa on it or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2723
02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I get your friend made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure I get it.</v>

2724
02:05:27.031 --> 02:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

2725
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.050
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't have to wear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I see both sides.</v>

2726
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really stupid to get super upset.</v>

2727
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are ridiculous articles that </v>

2728
02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.241
<v Speaker 1>completely missed the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fascinating point of this comment </v>

2729
02:05:41.241 --> 02:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>being like the first place we've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>a robot to land on,</v>

2730
02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:48.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have this happen in real time </v>

2731
02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:52.071
<v Speaker 1>while these people were experiencing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the monitors and everybody's </v>

2732
02:05:52.071 --> 02:05:56.181
<v Speaker 1>going crazy to to to focus instead on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's shirt and did make entire </v>

2733
02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:56.670
<v Speaker 1>articles.</v>

2734
02:05:56.670 --> 02:06:00.690
<v Speaker 1>All of your focus is on the guy's shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems very shortsighted.</v>

2735
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Very shortsighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things the aliens </v>

2736
02:06:06.110 --> 02:06:06.570
<v Speaker 1>would skip us over for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just start laughing.</v>

2737
02:06:06.571 --> 02:06:07.110
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

2738
02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just so concerned about fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2739
02:06:09.151 --> 02:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>

2740
02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>The girls on his shirt are sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

2741
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:15.810
<v Speaker 1>They're much more sexually attracted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women that are complaining about the</v>

2742
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>girls shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2743
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at all the twitter accounts </v>

2744
02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.221
<v Speaker 1>of all the women that were really </v>
<v Speaker 1>adamant about the fact this guy was an </v>

2745
02:06:25.221 --> 02:06:28.491
<v Speaker 1>asshole for wearing that shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to their photos and I looked at </v>

2746
02:06:28.491 --> 02:06:30.600
<v Speaker 1>all of them and I'm sure they're nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2747
02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you saw them in the same outfits </v>
<v Speaker 1>as those women on the shirt,</v>

2748
02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:39.780
<v Speaker 1>you would throw up in your mouth there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all people that have given up on</v>

2749
02:06:39.781 --> 02:06:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the idea of somebody being attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them physically,</v>

2750
02:06:42.091 --> 02:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>so they're not entourage extras that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're telling me they've given up.</v>

2751
02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're into science and they're not </v>

2752
02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:51.090
<v Speaker 1>into being slender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not into looking good.</v>

2753
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>They're into becoming more square shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and complaining a lot.</v>

2754
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good that they have an outlet for </v>

2755
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger is hopefully it'll be a more </v>

2756
02:07:07.131 --> 02:07:08.010
<v Speaker 1>worthy one in the future than somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's putting probes on a comet.</v>

2757
02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's ever going to come a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time where we have three types </v>

2758
02:07:13.651 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>of genders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have male,</v>

2759
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>female in non.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we get to a point where people </v>

2760
02:07:22.710 --> 02:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>get to a stage of life and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely give up on any gender </v>

2761
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and they assimilate into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>non form.</v>

2762
02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if that becomes an option and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people start saying,</v>

2763
02:07:36.071 --> 02:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about all the problems that sexual</v>

2764
02:07:39.011 --> 02:07:44.011
<v Speaker 1>identity causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about all the mis-gendering </v>

2765
02:07:44.011 --> 02:07:48.430
<v Speaker 1>things all the times where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to think one way,</v>

2766
02:07:48.431 --> 02:07:51.670
<v Speaker 1>but you really think another and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very confusing and frustrating.</v>

2767
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.490
<v Speaker 1>If you were a non,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have to worry about that.</v>

2768
02:07:54.491 --> 02:07:57.100
<v Speaker 1>If more people became nones and recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>survey,</v>

2769
02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:01.210
<v Speaker 1>17 percent of America said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if given the choice to have a completely</v>

2770
02:08:01.211 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>nonsexual existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do it.</v>

2771
02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They would be really annoying though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be worse,</v>

2772
02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:08.160
<v Speaker 1>not worse than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2773
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 1>atheists on reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like,</v>

2774
02:08:11.591 --> 02:08:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these nones,</v>

2775
02:08:12.821 --> 02:08:17.821
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just take up whole </v>

2776
02:08:17.821 --> 02:08:17.821
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third gender thing already.</v>

2777
02:08:17.821 --> 02:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A third concept that individuals are </v>

2778
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:25.140
<v Speaker 1>categorized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't read it up there at all.</v>

2779
02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:29.060
<v Speaker 6>Neither man nor woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as well as the social category president</v>

2780
02:08:29.061 --> 02:08:32.600
<v Speaker 6>in those societies who recognized three </v>
<v Speaker 6>or more genders.</v>

2781
02:08:34.290 --> 02:08:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an old picture too.</v>

2782
02:08:35.821 --> 02:08:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So that means that shit's been going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

2783
02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:41.130
<v Speaker 6>Tom NFP lived as a man for many years in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Germany,</v>

<v Speaker 1>those hands.</v>

<v Speaker 1>vintage.</v>

2792
02:09:06.031 --> 02:09:09.120

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2794

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2795
02:09:15.561 --> 02:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your fifties,</v>

2796
02:09:17.190 --> 02:09:18.780

<v Speaker 1>15 pounds below square and just give </v>
<v Speaker 1>given up just so you can still go to </v>

2800
02:09:27.061 --> 02:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody will fuck you,</v>

2801
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but you don't maybe know more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want it.</v>

2802
02:09:30.841 --> 02:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2803
02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just done.</v>

2804
02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And you can just become a non.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's benefits because for females </v>

2805
02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.951
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reach like a higher level of </v>

2806
02:09:42.951 --> 02:09:42.951
<v Speaker 1>physical strength.</v>

2807
02:09:42.951 --> 02:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>They get closer to man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the symbol for non so they can </v>

2808
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>recognize each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The international symbol.</v>

2809
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we define ourselves by our sex even when</v>

2810
02:09:48.961 --> 02:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to fuck you mean that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gender essentially.</v>

2811
02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it supposed to mean mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a female in the wrong bathroom,</v>

2812
02:09:57.290 --> 02:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2813
02:09:58.471 --> 02:09:59.490
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being loud,</v>

2814
02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to argue that transgender</v>

2815
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:08.060
<v Speaker 1>men should be able to use a men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms and transgender women should </v>

2816
02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>be able to use women's bathrooms even </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were born,</v>

2817
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>the opposite sex and some people have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with that.</v>

2818
02:10:12.690 --> 02:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Some people get upset at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how little I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like this.</v>

2820
02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about like gender,</v>

2821
02:10:23.670 --> 02:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>like male and female once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you're,</v>

2822
02:10:28.190 --> 02:10:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you can get pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one can get the other pregnant and once </v>

2823
02:10:33.190 --> 02:10:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you pass all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get to this point,</v>

2824
02:10:33.190 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>you're not having sex anymore.</v>

2825
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Like you're in your fifties or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2826
02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:40.910
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about what you are like,</v>

2827
02:10:40.911 --> 02:10:45.911
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking about it based on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that you have a vagina or you have </v>

2828
02:10:45.911 --> 02:10:48.971
<v Speaker 4>a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're no longer interested in </v>

2829
02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:48.971
<v Speaker 4>sexual intercourse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you no longer,</v>

2830
02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:52.850
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound like a burden to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>defined by one or the other,</v>

2831
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:58.070
<v Speaker 4>like instead of just being a human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not fucking see it become a </v>

2832
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:58.070
<v Speaker 4>non.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you become a nun.</v>

2833
02:10:58.100 --> 02:10:59.660
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you take,</v>

2834
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:01.760
<v Speaker 4>what is this on binary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2835
02:11:01.770 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 4>Google says non binary genders are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender identities that don't fit within </v>

2836
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:10.890
<v Speaker 4>the accepted binary of male and female </v>
<v Speaker 4>people can feel they are both neither or</v>

2837
02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:11.660
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2838
02:11:11.661 --> 02:11:16.661
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with this is with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>due respect is that this perhaps at </v>

2839
02:11:16.661 --> 02:11:19.130
<v Speaker 4>least on some folks is a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

2840
02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not talking about that.</v>

2841
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about like literally not </v>
<v Speaker 4>being male or female,</v>

2842
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 4>like building being neither being </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsexual and like if it becomes that </v>

2843
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 4>option and they give you an option where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can walk around and you look like,</v>

2844
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:34.070
<v Speaker 4>like one of those gray aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have genitals.</v>

2845
02:11:34.490 --> 02:11:37.070
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a couple of friends who are women</v>

2846
02:11:37.071 --> 02:11:39.110
<v Speaker 4>and if you start to treat them in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain way,</v>

2847
02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:40.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

2848
02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:41.930
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2849
02:11:41.931 --> 02:11:46.280
<v Speaker 4>because they don't really fall into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>female gender assumptions.</v>

2850
02:11:46.281 --> 02:11:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Like there's still women and they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that women do,</v>

2851
02:11:49.071 --> 02:11:52.490
<v Speaker 4>but they don't like to be treated like </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything other than what they are,</v>

2852
02:11:52.491 --> 02:11:54.710
<v Speaker 4>which is not very feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a couple of my friends.</v>

2853
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:57.050
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by don't like to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>treated?</v>

2854
02:11:57.710 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 4>There's a way that certain guys act </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the women.</v>

2855
02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.440
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a low level anxiety because you're </v>

2856
02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:08.060
<v Speaker 4>seeking out their acceptance because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2857
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:11.630
<v Speaker 4>their acceptance means that I'm sexually</v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive.</v>

2858
02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even if they're not going to fuck </v>

2859
02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.401
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still want them to like you and </v>

2860
02:12:18.401 --> 02:12:19.841
<v Speaker 4>laugh at your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your stuff and like you're trying to </v>

2861
02:12:19.841 --> 02:12:20.360
<v Speaker 4>impress them in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are women who are like,</v>

2862
02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:21.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're friends now.</v>

2863
02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:22.620
<v Speaker 4>We're buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2864
02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:25.280
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be like this with one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your friends,</v>

2865
02:12:25.281 --> 02:12:30.281
<v Speaker 4>so why would you be like this with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like interject gender into </v>

2866
02:12:30.281 --> 02:12:30.710
<v Speaker 4>everything when I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2867
02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:32.840
<v Speaker 4>they're probably smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is,</v>

2868
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:37.400
<v Speaker 4>it's just that is a real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 4>women and men and it's gross to see when</v>

2869
02:12:37.401 --> 02:12:40.310
<v Speaker 4>you're around your friends and then a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl comes over and you always have that</v>

2870
02:12:40.311 --> 02:12:45.311
<v Speaker 4>one dude who like completely changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about to not as pants and really </v>

2871
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:47.750
<v Speaker 4>interact as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2872
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Changes who he is like this fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the motivation for his </v>

2873
02:12:52.810 --> 02:12:56.270
<v Speaker 4>communication changes and we've all been</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person before.</v>

2874
02:12:56.340 --> 02:12:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of like.</v>

2875
02:12:59.331 --> 02:13:04.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's neat that a woman is as far</v>

2876
02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:09.191
<v Speaker 4>from one of us says you can get while </v>
<v Speaker 4>still being the same species and that's </v>

2877
02:13:09.321 --> 02:13:14.321
<v Speaker 4>not at all meant to be a sexist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like if you look at what you </v>

2878
02:13:14.321 --> 02:13:14.321
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your biology,</v>

2879
02:13:14.321 --> 02:13:18.941
<v Speaker 4>your Oregon's a woman is having as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a different experience as possible </v>

2880
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 4>while still being the same exact species</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you and vice versa.</v>

2881
02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:28.180
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The male experience is different from a </v>

2882
02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:30.491
<v Speaker 4>woman's in many ways and so it's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing where instead of dividing </v>

2883
02:13:30.491 --> 02:13:31.010
<v Speaker 4>over it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can come together and be.</v>

2884
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>That's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

2885
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.630
<v Speaker 5>guys get to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this and this.</v>

2886
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:36.780
<v Speaker 5>We do this and I'm just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>intrigued by it.</v>

2887
02:13:36.781 --> 02:13:38.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not intimidated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's cool.</v>

2888
02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:43.730
<v Speaker 5>You're different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're open mind and you should get </v>

2889
02:13:43.730 --> 02:13:46.371
<v Speaker 5>wooden beads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should should start doing yoga and </v>

2890
02:13:46.371 --> 02:13:47.070
<v Speaker 5>just write this in a book and sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2891
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:50.940
<v Speaker 5>I think David has that one down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a couple of,</v>

2892
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:56.030
<v Speaker 5>a couple of million copies that had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do that guy put some shit up on twitter </v>

2893
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:57.210
<v Speaker 5>every few months and I have to comment </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

2894
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 5>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like just macro trolling.</v>

2895
02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 5>I can't help him because he writes shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's just,</v>

2896
02:14:03.031 --> 02:14:06.270
<v Speaker 5>it's the aware system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the awareness over and over again.</v>

2897
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:11.870
<v Speaker 5>He's just saying Mumbo jumbo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen the Deepak Chopra a </v>

2898
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:12.420
<v Speaker 5>sentence generator?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2899
02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:14.660
<v Speaker 5>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>

2900
02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.720
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you click on it and it randomly spits </v>

2901
02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:19.720
<v Speaker 5>out a bunch of metaphysical words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected,</v>

2902
02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:20.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interconnectedness,</v>

2903
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:24.170
<v Speaker 5>quantum in the quantum level and it just</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a console horseshit.</v>

2904
02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:29.250
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like the most ineffective complex </v>

2905
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:32.601
<v Speaker 5>communicator ever and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I told them what's really </v>

2906
02:14:32.601 --> 02:14:34.230
<v Speaker 5>hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of people were explaining to him</v>

2907
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:39.320
<v Speaker 5>to me what he meant and they're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like know what he means is by </v>

2908
02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:39.320
<v Speaker 5>awareness like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2909
02:14:39.321 --> 02:14:41.460
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2910
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Stop what he means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what the fuck he means </v>

2911
02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:46.490
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know what I mean?</v>

2912
02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:51.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a super ineffective way of </v>

2913
02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:53.601
<v Speaker 5>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows and you know that that is some </v>

2914
02:14:53.601 --> 02:14:54.660
<v Speaker 5>fucking sloppy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sentence is ridiculous.</v>

2915
02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:56.680
<v Speaker 5>It's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

2916
02:14:56.690 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 5>It's not very clear at all what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

2917
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:03.600
<v Speaker 5>It is a bunch of fucking Mumbo jumbo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a bunch of word salad.</v>

2918
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:08.750
<v Speaker 5>There's no question about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you want it to be really clear </v>

2919
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:12.320
<v Speaker 5>as to what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's part of what goes on with a </v>

2920
02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.560
<v Speaker 5>lot of these spiritual type thinkers.</v>

2921
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:16.410
<v Speaker 5>People that talk about the quantum level</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all this,</v>

2922
02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.680
<v Speaker 5>this weird metaphysical Mumbo jumbo talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that keeping things mysterious is a </v>

2923
02:15:21.871 --> 02:15:25.140
<v Speaker 5>huge part of the hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to keep things mysterious.</v>

2924
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:30.830
<v Speaker 5>Simplifying things is the worst thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do when you look at people that </v>

2925
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 5>are trying to explain science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to really try to explain science.</v>

2926
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:39.861
<v Speaker 5>Look at Neil degrasse Tyson's twitter </v>
<v Speaker 5>feed and you'll see a guy who explains </v>

2927
02:15:39.861 --> 02:15:44.541
<v Speaker 5>things very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You never read a Neil degrasse Tyson </v>

2928
02:15:44.541 --> 02:15:45.720
<v Speaker 5>tweet and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck did he mean by that?</v>

2929
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:47.350
<v Speaker 5>It's real clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

2930
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:49.590
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he's an awesome communicator.</v>

2931
02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:50.940
<v Speaker 5>What are you showing up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buddy?</v>

2932
02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:53.130
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you got here?</v>

2933
02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the chopra thing.</v>

2934
02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we can't see that.</v>

2935
02:15:57.970 --> 02:15:59.860
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2936
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:01.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing it on the scrambler.</v>

2937
02:16:01.230 --> 02:16:02.580
<v Speaker 5>What is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what's happening.</v>

2938
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.740
<v Speaker 5>We're talking and there's a video in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>

2939
02:16:05.210 --> 02:16:10.210
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did like one of his books back in the </v>

2940
02:16:10.210 --> 02:16:10.210
<v Speaker 5>day though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2941
02:16:10.210 --> 02:16:11.730
<v Speaker 5>a seven spiritual laws of success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got some good ideas.</v>

2942
02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 5>Quantum physics unfolds into total </v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptance of neural networks.</v>

2943
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this one of the generators,</v>

2944
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:23.160
<v Speaker 5>the generator and the Higgs Boson fears </v>
<v Speaker 5>species specific opportunities?</v>

2945
02:16:23.161 --> 02:16:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These seem totally real.</v>

2946
02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 5>They seem totally real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what he's doing.</v>

2947
02:16:27.031 --> 02:16:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is exactly what he's doing.</v>

2948
02:16:28.771 --> 02:16:33.771
<v Speaker 5>He's a bunch of shit and some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can kind of interpret it if </v>

2949
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:36.730
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into some sort of a,</v>

2950
02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:41.820
<v Speaker 5>a valid sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is he's really super </v>

2951
02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 5>ineffective with how he forms these </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentences and the con,</v>

2952
02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:47.610
<v Speaker 5>the thoughts that are being conveyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you go to Neil degrasse </v>

2953
02:16:47.610 --> 02:16:50.880
<v Speaker 5>Tyson's twitter feed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's super obvious what he's saying </v>

2954
02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.240
<v Speaker 5>really obvious and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might say I'm an idiot,</v>

2955
02:16:52.241 --> 02:16:57.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm Kinda dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not dumb enough that I don't </v>

2956
02:16:57.241 --> 02:16:57.830
<v Speaker 5>know when you're being a fucking idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2957
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.990
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're doing.</v>

2958
02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 5>You're just splashing a bunch of words </v>
<v Speaker 5>together and trying to pretend like this</v>

2959
02:17:03.641 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 5>is some deep sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is poorly thought out shit.</v>

2960
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:09.670
<v Speaker 5>And people gobble it up because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>love it.</v>

2961
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 5>They love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That whole,</v>

2962
02:17:11.370 --> 02:17:13.840
<v Speaker 5>the whole package,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the brown skin,</v>

2963
02:17:13.841 --> 02:17:16.300
<v Speaker 5>the Indian background,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole deal.</v>

2964
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Please Swami,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please Kumaré.</v>

2965
02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Teach me the way you see that </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary.</v>

2966
02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:24.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen it,</v>

2967
02:17:24.281 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 5>but I know it's unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was awesome.</v>

2968
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:27.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a great premise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go around as a fake.</v>

2969
02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 5>It's sad though when the people were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like super into him,</v>

2970
02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sad.</v>

2971
02:17:32.081 --> 02:17:37.081
<v Speaker 5>They're crying that he's actually there </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them and you realize he's that he </v>

2972
02:17:37.081 --> 02:17:38.410
<v Speaker 5>actually is having this positive effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>on these people because they're so lost.</v>

2973
02:17:38.411 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really need him to be that guy.</v>

2974
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:46.770
<v Speaker 5>People really do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>want that one person to be so connected.</v>

2975
02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:51.490
<v Speaker 5>They don't realize that what you should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be seeking is your own.</v>

2976
02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Instead of seeking like this one person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to be your guru is going to </v>

2977
02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 5>show you the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seek your own experiences,</v>

2978
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:04.720
<v Speaker 5>seek your own enlightening moments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through yoga,</v>

2979
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:07.870
<v Speaker 5>through meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sensory deprivation tank,</v>

2980
02:18:07.871 --> 02:18:12.871
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through fucking hiking and </v>

2981
02:18:12.871 --> 02:18:12.871
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just being alone by yourself,</v>

2982
02:18:12.871 --> 02:18:15.670
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through exploring ideas,</v>

2983
02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seek your own answers to stuff,</v>

2984
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:23.761
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that you're going to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>across this one master that hasn't </v>

2985
02:18:23.761 --> 02:18:24.670
<v Speaker 5>nailed the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throw that away,</v>

2986
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.490
<v Speaker 5>throw that away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you meet the Buddha in the road,</v>

2987
02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:28.870
<v Speaker 5>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2988
02:18:28.871 --> 02:18:32.070
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the old expression that said,</v>

2989
02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 5>throw that shit away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't.</v>

2990
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:39.270
<v Speaker 5>Don't want to find a fucking master </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't exist.</v>

2991
02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:44.820
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get roped into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might find people that are </v>

2992
02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:47.281
<v Speaker 5>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have an incredible grasp of </v>

2993
02:18:47.281 --> 02:18:50.791
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as soon as they start pushing </v>

2994
02:18:50.791 --> 02:18:53.350
<v Speaker 5>themselves as a master run that </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody's trying to sell you a book,</v>

2995
02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:57.190
<v Speaker 5>someone trying to tell you that they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2996
02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:02.280
<v Speaker 5>Watch decoding depok ever see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking documentary his own son made his</v>

2997
02:19:02.831 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 5>son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made a documentary on him,</v>

2998
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:07.420
<v Speaker 5>clowning him where he catches a </v>
<v Speaker 5>meditating and he's.</v>

2999
02:19:07.450 --> 02:19:08.740
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go meditate,</v>

3000
02:19:08.741 --> 02:19:11.190
<v Speaker 5>and he catches them snoring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Videotapes that,</v>

3001
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:15.130
<v Speaker 5>these splices that altogether showing it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it makes him look so ridiculous.</v>

3002
02:19:15.250 --> 02:19:20.250
<v Speaker 5>And to Deepak's credit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he actually went on opiod anthony with </v>

3003
02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:22.070
<v Speaker 5>his son and talked about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that he's,</v>

3004
02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:23.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just a normal person.</v>

3005
02:19:23.430 --> 02:19:26.770
<v Speaker 5>He says who he is and his son made a </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary about him but his sunrail he</v>

3006
02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:29.690
<v Speaker 5>clowned him in this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to check that out.</v>

3007
02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to see it.</v>

3008
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:32.570
<v Speaker 5>You should eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least watch the trailer.</v>

3009
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:34.430
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so ridiculous.</v>

3010
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:39.460
<v Speaker 5>It's his son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really clowned him and just makes </v>

3011
02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:42.491
<v Speaker 5>you realize like what it must have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to grow up with this guy as your </v>

3012
02:19:42.491 --> 02:19:45.881
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like spouting his son is very smart to </v>

3013
02:19:45.881 --> 02:19:49.060
<v Speaker 5>the sun was on Opie and anthony with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and you kind of sense first of all </v>

3014
02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 5>a that he really does love his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his dad,</v>

3015
02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:52.370
<v Speaker 5>he knows his dad is not a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

3016
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:56.660
<v Speaker 5>but you could sense the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>frustration and you know,</v>

3017
02:19:56.661 --> 02:20:01.661
<v Speaker 5>the difference between like whose dad </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually is and like this menopausal </v>

3018
02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:04.880
<v Speaker 5>misconception that these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3019
02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:07.490
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of lost women and older men.</v>

3020
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:09.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean I say menopausal male menopause </v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

3021
02:20:09.761 --> 02:20:14.761
<v Speaker 5>Like there's older people searching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>searching for spirituality that stumble </v>

3022
02:20:14.761 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 5>on the bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They find work stack of his books.</v>

3023
02:20:16.791 --> 02:20:21.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I've always been metaphysical at </v>

3024
02:20:21.791 --> 02:20:21.791
<v Speaker 5>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3025
02:20:21.791 --> 02:20:24.410
<v Speaker 5>people are always searching for this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really deep hidden meaning.</v>

3026
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:29.680
<v Speaker 5>But what's really interesting to me is I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't see that in psychedelic circles.</v>

3027
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:34.400
<v Speaker 5>One thing that I don't see in </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic circles is the acceptance of</v>

3028
02:20:34.401 --> 02:20:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Gurus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's one of the last places where</v>

3029
02:20:37.431 --> 02:20:40.160
<v Speaker 5>I got like deep pockets going to thrive </v>
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

3030
02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you talked to him about Lsd,</v>

3031
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 5>I could achieve these states with my own</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>

3032
02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:44.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3033
02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:44.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3034
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:45.600
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3035
02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:46.320
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>

3036
02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:48.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can.</v>

3037
02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:50.070
<v Speaker 4>And if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think you can,</v>

3038
02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:52.200
<v Speaker 4>it's most likely because you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>been there already.</v>

3039
02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can achieve dmt without DMT,</v>

3040
02:20:55.230 --> 02:20:57.180
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a better man than most.</v>

3041
02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Some special creature that's studied </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kundalini Yoga for 10 years and locked </v>

3042
02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:05.010
<v Speaker 4>herself in a fucking monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna,</v>

3043
02:21:05.011 --> 02:21:10.011
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that LSD was like the most </v>

3044
02:21:10.011 --> 02:21:10.011
<v Speaker 4>significant molecule of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>

3045
02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:10.730
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3046
02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:13.410
<v Speaker 4>you can give that to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3047
02:21:13.411 --> 02:21:15.750
<v Speaker 4>if you go on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can search for LSD,</v>

3048
02:21:15.751 --> 02:21:17.370
<v Speaker 4>housewife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19 fifties.</v>

3049
02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

3050
02:21:18.271 --> 02:21:23.271
<v Speaker 4>That's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing video because this is a </v>

3051
02:21:23.271 --> 02:21:26.181
<v Speaker 4>woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were told you were about to be </v>

3052
02:21:26.181 --> 02:21:28.611
<v Speaker 4>given LSD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least you would know it's about to </v>

3053
02:21:28.611 --> 02:21:28.611
<v Speaker 4>hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is a fucking housewife.</v>

3054
02:21:28.611 --> 02:21:32.800
<v Speaker 4>It's just been sent there to do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment and he gives her a glass of </v>

3055
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:32.800
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3056
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:32.800
<v Speaker 4>here you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ma'am.</v>

3057
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:37.701
<v Speaker 4>Here's your Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it just hits her and you see this </v>

3058
02:21:37.701 --> 02:21:41.901
<v Speaker 4>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're as one of my friends </v>

3059
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:41.901
<v Speaker 4>put it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're watching the sixties on</v>

3060
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:43.400
<v Speaker 4>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're watching the 19 fifties transform</v>

3061
02:21:43.401 --> 02:21:48.401
<v Speaker 4>into the sixties to this one woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>through this one woman and her one LSD </v>

3062
02:21:48.401 --> 02:21:51.600
<v Speaker 4>experience and a Steve Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually in that biography,</v>

3063
02:21:51.601 --> 02:21:52.680
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said earlier,</v>

3064
02:21:52.681 --> 02:21:56.550
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of stuff like he called </v>
<v Speaker 4>his era when he grew up,</v>

3065
02:21:56.551 --> 02:22:00.030
<v Speaker 4>a magical time because everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the influence of psychedelics.</v>

3066
02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the big shift between the </v>

3067
02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>fifties and the sixties without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the seventies,</v>

3068
02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:06.000
<v Speaker 4>the lock it all down.</v>

3069
02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened.</v>

3070
02:22:07.011 --> 02:22:08.900
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pass those sweeping,</v>

3071
02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:12.230
<v Speaker 5>the sweeping psychedelics bill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1970.</v>

3072
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:14.720
<v Speaker 5>That made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They made a bunch of stuff illegal.</v>

3073
02:22:14.721 --> 02:22:18.680
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't even psychologic or it </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't even a psychoactive.</v>

3074
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:24.030
<v Speaker 5>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's different compounds that they </v>

3075
02:22:24.030 --> 02:22:24.030
<v Speaker 5>made illegal that they don't even affect</v>
<v Speaker 5>the human mind.</v>

3076
02:22:24.030 --> 02:22:28.840
<v Speaker 5>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just locking everything down so </v>

3077
02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:29.100
<v Speaker 5>they're doing stuff without real science</v>
<v Speaker 5>behind it.</v>

3078
02:22:29.770 --> 02:22:32.190
<v Speaker 5>They're not going after the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>compounds.</v>

3079
02:22:32.191 --> 02:22:37.191
<v Speaker 5>They're just going after anything that </v>
<v Speaker 5>might alter consciousness in a way that </v>

3080
02:22:37.191 --> 02:22:40.050
<v Speaker 5>threatens the powers that be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where they were at.</v>

3081
02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:45.080
<v Speaker 5>They were at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in this weird place where the </v>

3082
02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:48.261
<v Speaker 5>world had changed so much in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were terrified as to what the fuck </v>

3083
02:22:48.261 --> 02:22:48.750
<v Speaker 5>was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next 10.</v>

3084
02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 5>They saw these flower power people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all this fucking give peace,</v>

3085
02:22:53.221 --> 02:22:54.810
<v Speaker 5>a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>

3086
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.520
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is going on here?</v>

3087
02:22:56.521 --> 02:23:01.521
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this never even existed in the 19 </v>

3088
02:23:01.521 --> 02:23:01.790
<v Speaker 5>forties when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we are in the 19 sixties.</v>

3089
02:23:01.791 --> 02:23:06.791
<v Speaker 5>These God damn hippies and walk them </v>
<v Speaker 5>through Kent State trying to stop the </v>

3090
02:23:06.791 --> 02:23:06.791
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>

3091
02:23:06.791 --> 02:23:11.160
<v Speaker 3>What's really kind of scary to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is thinking about how they locked </v>

3092
02:23:11.291 --> 02:23:16.291
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think it's bad because of the </v>

3093
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:16.291
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3094
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't want to do acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do weed.</v>

3095
02:23:17.171 --> 02:23:22.171
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do any of these bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounding things that make you seem like </v>

3096
02:23:22.171 --> 02:23:22.840
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of on the fringes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

3097
02:23:23.170 --> 02:23:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So only the people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fringes of society start doing these </v>

3098
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:32.011
<v Speaker 3>things and you no longer have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>captains of industry like steve jobs </v>

3099
02:23:32.011 --> 02:23:36.690
<v Speaker 3>experimenting with this stuff and as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>result you don't have as much inspiring </v>

3100
02:23:36.690 --> 02:23:36.700
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3101
02:23:36.701 --> 02:23:40.840
<v Speaker 3>like we've kind of been caught in a Rut </v>
<v Speaker 3>up until very recently until that whole,</v>

3102
02:23:41.410 --> 02:23:44.380
<v Speaker 3>the whole like Bitcoin Wiki leaks type </v>
<v Speaker 3>era.</v>

3103
02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:49.740
<v Speaker 3>We were in a span of eight or nine years</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like very little personal </v>

3104
02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:53.251
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little dissent or discussion of </v>

3105
02:23:53.251 --> 02:23:53.251
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're moving.</v>

3106
02:23:53.251 --> 02:23:53.830
<v Speaker 3>So I really think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think after nine slash 11,</v>

3107
02:23:53.831 --> 02:23:57.400
<v Speaker 3>pretty much society went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not for survival,</v>

3108
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:59.560
<v Speaker 3>we're going to put it on the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>burner.</v>

3109
02:23:59.770 --> 02:24:04.770
<v Speaker 3>So we were still doing other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now finally we're getting that </v>

3110
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:07.330
<v Speaker 3>explosion of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experimentation that we were supposed to</v>

3111
02:24:07.331 --> 02:24:12.331
<v Speaker 3>get probably 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bitcoin is one of those things and </v>

3112
02:24:12.331 --> 02:24:15.900
<v Speaker 3>like real independent media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your show is another one and </v>

3113
02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:15.900
<v Speaker 3>they're all blossoming.</v>

3114
02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:17.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it was all inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

3115
02:24:17.791 --> 02:24:22.791
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think and I think quite honestly more </v>

3116
02:24:22.791 --> 02:24:24.120
<v Speaker 5>people are probably doing psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs now than have ever before,</v>

3117
02:24:24.121 --> 02:24:26.520
<v Speaker 5>including in the 1970 [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 19 sixties.</v>

3118
02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:28.590
<v Speaker 5>I think the numbers are through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>roof.</v>

3119
02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:30.810
<v Speaker 5>I think we are caught up in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it,</v>

3120
02:24:30.811 --> 02:24:33.180
<v Speaker 5>so we're not totally aware of what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>

3121
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:38.510
<v Speaker 5>but if you include marijuana and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely do when it comes to eating </v>

3122
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:42.411
<v Speaker 5>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider eating marijuana a </v>

3123
02:24:42.411 --> 02:24:42.411
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic truck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

3124
02:24:42.411 --> 02:24:43.470
<v Speaker 5>And I think that people who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they probably,</v>

3125
02:24:43.471 --> 02:24:45.360
<v Speaker 5>they're just probably not eating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff were eating,</v>

3126
02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:50.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit that you're getting out of </v>

3127
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.710
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the gummies,</v>

3128
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:54.270
<v Speaker 3>the inception moments where you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't feel the same about something </v>

3129
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:54.270
<v Speaker 3>again</v>

3130
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:54.270
<v Speaker 5>ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Including the very fiber of reality </v>

3132
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.831
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These God damn things are so powerful </v>

3133
02:25:01.831 --> 02:25:04.360
<v Speaker 5>and the experience is just not the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>as smoking it.</v>

3134
02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:07.960
<v Speaker 5>It's way more significant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way deeper and weirder.</v>

3135
02:25:07.961 --> 02:25:12.961
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a different truck when you eat it </v>

3136
02:25:12.961 --> 02:25:15.300
<v Speaker 5>and it's responsible for a lot of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient Hindu religious art and </v>

3137
02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:18.700
<v Speaker 5>religious scriptures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of that stuff was being done while</v>

3138
02:25:18.701 --> 02:25:19.670
<v Speaker 5>they were eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has She?</v>

3139
02:25:19.671 --> 02:25:20.250
<v Speaker 5>She.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was,</v>

3140
02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.320
<v Speaker 5>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the preferred method of delivery </v>

3141
02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 5>cannabis for a long time was eating it.</v>

3142
02:25:26.310 --> 02:25:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a religious high day,</v>

3143
02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:34.420
<v Speaker 4>a high day in India where they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke all day long to like get in touch </v>

3144
02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:35.370
<v Speaker 4>with the goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the goddesses.</v>

3145
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3146
02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's a lot of religions are </v>

3147
02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:41.120
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seeks.</v>

3148
02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:43.410
<v Speaker 5>There's certain sex of Sikhs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat this yogurt.</v>

3149
02:25:43.411 --> 02:25:45.780
<v Speaker 5>They were explaining it to Duncan and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was explaining it to me,</v>

3150
02:25:45.781 --> 02:25:48.060
<v Speaker 5>so I apologize from fucking something </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

3151
02:25:48.061 --> 02:25:51.330
<v Speaker 5>But there's some yogurt yogurt that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana in it.</v>

3152
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:56.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the marijuana infused honey or </v>

3153
02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:59.721
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they mix it in this yogurt and get </v>

3154
02:25:59.721 --> 02:25:59.721
<v Speaker 5>fucking.</v>

3155
02:25:59.721 --> 02:25:59.721
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:25:59.721 --> 02:26:04.420
<v Speaker 5>Blasted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these dudes were explaining it to </v>

3157
02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:04.600
<v Speaker 5>Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how important it is to them.</v>

3158
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>Sikhs or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an interesting race of people or </v>

3159
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a group.</v>

3160
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:12.200
<v Speaker 5>They get connected to a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3161
02:26:12.201 --> 02:26:16.050
<v Speaker 5>ignorantly to like Muslims and Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3162
02:26:16.051 --> 02:26:21.051
<v Speaker 5>like the people to see things with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People see things on people's heads and </v>

3163
02:26:21.051 --> 02:26:22.960
<v Speaker 5>they thing they're all the same folks </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3164
02:26:22.961 --> 02:26:27.730
<v Speaker 5>but ancient religions that had their </v>
<v Speaker 5>roots in psychedelics,</v>

3165
02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:32.970
<v Speaker 5>there's still a lot of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>around are still a lot of them that </v>

3166
02:26:32.970 --> 02:26:36.151
<v Speaker 5>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of evidence that shows </v>

3167
02:26:36.151 --> 02:26:36.190
<v Speaker 5>that it's shaped a lot of thinking way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

3168
02:26:36.191 --> 02:26:40.810
<v Speaker 5>way back in the day and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get on the that mindset,</v>

3169
02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:46.470
<v Speaker 5>get into the groove that those people </v>
<v Speaker 5>must have been in when they were doing </v>

3170
02:26:46.470 --> 02:26:50.431
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you eat hash and think about what it </v>

3171
02:26:50.431 --> 02:26:53.230
<v Speaker 5>must've been like to live 300 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you pretty much put yourself in a</v>

3172
02:26:53.231 --> 02:26:58.231
<v Speaker 5>state of mind where you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>think the way they were thinking a </v>

3173
02:26:58.231 --> 02:26:59.350
<v Speaker 5>little bit mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can never erase the information that</v>

3174
02:26:59.351 --> 02:27:04.351
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but imagine what it would be like to </v>

3175
02:27:04.351 --> 02:27:06.280
<v Speaker 5>live two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>3000 years ago and to be eating hash and</v>

3176
02:27:06.281 --> 02:27:11.281
<v Speaker 5>hanging out in India and just tripping </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fucking balls off on this big round</v>

3177
02:27:11.411 --> 02:27:13.360
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spinning around in space.</v>

3178
02:27:14.970 --> 02:27:16.970
<v Speaker 5>Illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:18.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think there's more people doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that now.</v>

3180
02:27:18.810 --> 02:27:21.540
<v Speaker 5>There's more people eating marijuana now</v>
<v Speaker 5>than probably ever before.</v>

3181
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I think that's pretty safe to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are just staggering.</v>

3182
02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:27.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the numbers that are,</v>

3183
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.830
<v Speaker 5>that are</v>

3184
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:29.750
<v Speaker 4>22 states and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3185
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:33.050
<v Speaker 4>the territory of Guam now have some kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of legalization,</v>

3186
02:27:33.051 --> 02:27:35.390
<v Speaker 4>so really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or medical marijuana laws,</v>

3187
02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Washington DC's are going to be a weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

3188
02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:40.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know when that goes into effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that passed recently.</v>

3189
02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.120
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be weird for sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can have congressional aides</v>

3190
02:27:44.390 --> 02:27:48.050
<v Speaker 4>go home for lunch hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get high legally come back.</v>

3191
02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:51.380
<v Speaker 4>They'll be tested even if it's still not</v>
<v Speaker 4>federally legal,</v>

3192
02:27:51.381 --> 02:27:54.940
<v Speaker 4>which is hilarious because that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the federal government's offices are.</v>

3193
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:58.710
<v Speaker 4>So the very state where their offices </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in Washington DC.</v>

3194
02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the federal government more than </v>

3195
02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.360
<v Speaker 4>anything else that likes money and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is one of the most obvious money grabs.</v>

3196
02:28:05.361 --> 02:28:06.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you,</v>

3197
02:28:06.850 --> 02:28:10.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're cutting out all of these where the</v>

3198
02:28:10.191 --> 02:28:15.191
<v Speaker 4>money goes south to the cartels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can keep all that in the United </v>

3199
02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:15.191
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fuck load of money.</v>

3200
02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:19.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of looking at it and not </v>

3201
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:20.720
<v Speaker 4>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also small business opportunities.</v>

3202
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of startup costs.</v>

3203
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Pretty easy to fucking start your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>small business selling weed.</v>

3204
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty easy to grow it if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>start transferring that to the,</v>

3205
02:28:29.481 --> 02:28:31.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it as a commodity,</v>

3206
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>like the hamp movement that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about with clothes and paper and</v>

3207
02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.420
<v Speaker 1>building materials and all those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>start happening.</v>

3208
02:28:38.421 --> 02:28:43.421
<v Speaker 1>If that becomes legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will literally transform this entire </v>

3209
02:28:43.421 --> 02:28:46.481
<v Speaker 1>country when people find out how easy it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for farmers to grow hemp and profit </v>

3210
02:28:47.391 --> 02:28:52.391
<v Speaker 1>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're not talking at all about </v>

3211
02:28:52.391 --> 02:28:52.391
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with the drug.</v>

3212
02:28:52.391 --> 02:28:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only legal in a couple states to </v>

3213
02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.680
<v Speaker 1>grow hamp and manufacturer hamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I know,</v>

3214
02:28:58.130 --> 02:29:01.280
<v Speaker 1>it's still not like no one's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going for it.</v>

3215
02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:06.340
<v Speaker 1>No big companies are moving in giving it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shot because it's still federally </v>

3216
02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:10.121
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because not even </v>

3217
02:29:10.121 --> 02:29:13.030
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a cousin of the psychoactive </v>

3218
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:14.300
<v Speaker 1>strain of marijuana and still illegal.</v>

3219
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:17.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to end.</v>

3220
02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:20.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt unless something </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

3221
02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:23.210
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that could put the genie </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the bottle,</v>

3222
02:29:24.170 --> 02:29:26.300
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic event,</v>

3223
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.720
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some nuclear bomb goes off or something </v>

3224
02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:33.620
<v Speaker 1>where they have to completely 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84.</v>

3225
02:29:33.621 --> 02:29:37.700
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker tighten down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screws and cut,</v>

3226
02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:40.700
<v Speaker 1>cut off the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filter everything.</v>

3227
02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:43.160
<v Speaker 1>No more drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more anything.</v>

3228
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be something like </v>

3229
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:50.210
<v Speaker 1>really huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something really huge and scary and even</v>

3230
02:29:50.211 --> 02:29:53.270
<v Speaker 1>then it might not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even then people might be like,</v>

3231
02:29:53.271 --> 02:29:58.271
<v Speaker 1>you know what the reason why this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking nuclear should happen in the </v>

3232
02:29:58.271 --> 02:29:58.271
<v Speaker 1>first place because we were listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assholes.</v>

3233
02:29:58.271 --> 02:30:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's more likely is if </v>

3234
02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:05.171
<v Speaker 1>there was some calamity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just feel like we're </v>

3235
02:30:05.171 --> 02:30:05.171
<v Speaker 1>going to go do our own thing.</v>

3236
02:30:05.171 --> 02:30:05.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of all this ferguson </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests?</v>

3237
02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Ferguson just because that decision </v>

3238
02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:15.280
<v Speaker 1>or do you think that this is like a sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are ready to start fucking </v>

3239
02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.480
<v Speaker 1>protesting shit because I'm more </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined to believe the latter?</v>

3240
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of resentment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States over the fact that for</v>

3241
02:30:22.221 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 1>many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find honest work,</v>

3242
02:30:24.530 --> 02:30:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but if you decide to go into law </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>

3243
02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you can suddenly make you a comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000</v>

3244
02:30:29.961 --> 02:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>a year and some places just feeding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison system,</v>

3245
02:30:33.501 --> 02:30:36.500
<v Speaker 1>innocent people and that sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of tree hugger thing,</v>

3246
02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:41.501
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what a lot of these </v>

3247
02:30:41.501 --> 02:30:43.190
<v Speaker 1>police departments are doing is sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor disadvantaged people.</v>

3248
02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:48.191
<v Speaker 1>Most of the minorities into prison for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>owning things that I don't consider it </v>

3249
02:30:48.191 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 1>to be harmful to society.</v>

3250
02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:54.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't consider marijuana to be </v>

3251
02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:56.051
<v Speaker 1>harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even some of the harder drugs that </v>

3252
02:30:56.051 --> 02:30:56.051
<v Speaker 1>people get busted on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3253
02:30:56.051 --> 02:31:00.131
<v Speaker 1>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're literally their only </v>

3254
02:31:00.131 --> 02:31:01.871
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what we're talking about </v>

3255
02:31:01.871 --> 02:31:01.871
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about police brutality,</v>

3256
02:31:01.871 --> 02:31:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but it has nothing to do with distrust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe is connected to the fact that </v>

3257
02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:10.900
<v Speaker 1>they can't trust these police officers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can ruin your life if they </v>

3258
02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:12.920
<v Speaker 1>want to over something very arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the backdrop for it.</v>

3259
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all the specifics of </v>

3260
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but based on what I saw,</v>

3261
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that grand jury thing there should a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial like there are too</v>

3262
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:25.070
<v Speaker 5>many inconsistencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole point of a public trial is to </v>

3263
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:27.771
<v Speaker 5>figure out what happened and if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 5>police officer and that means somehow </v>

3264
02:31:27.771 --> 02:31:28.860
<v Speaker 5>you're treated differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That to me doesn't add up.</v>

3265
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that when you're dealing with </v>

3266
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:38.001
<v Speaker 5>police brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot better examples than this </v>

3267
02:31:38.001 --> 02:31:38.001
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of examples.</v>

3268
02:31:38.001 --> 02:31:41.040
<v Speaker 5>There are absolutely fucking horrific </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could find on youtube.</v>

3269
02:31:41.041 --> 02:31:43.380
<v Speaker 5>You can find them everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some kid that got tasered.</v>

3270
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:48.710
<v Speaker 5>He was in his girlfriend's car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cop tasered him hit him in near the </v>

3271
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.990
<v Speaker 5>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He felt it's a white kid,</v>

3272
02:31:48.991 --> 02:31:52.410
<v Speaker 5>fell face planted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped breathing,</v>

3273
02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:57.680
<v Speaker 5>went into cardiac arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't revive him for like three </v>

3274
02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:01.041
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might have brain damage because this </v>

3275
02:32:01.041 --> 02:32:01.041
<v Speaker 5>kid did nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did nothing wrong.</v>

3276
02:32:01.041 --> 02:32:01.880
<v Speaker 5>It's just sitting in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the cop told him,</v>

3277
02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:04.350
<v Speaker 5>roll the window down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently the window didn't roll down.</v>

3278
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:06.270
<v Speaker 5>Cop fucking tasered him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3279
02:32:06.330 --> 02:32:11.330
<v Speaker 5>I obviously I wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like they show this kid on the </v>

3280
02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:12.690
<v Speaker 5>ground and the complex standing over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing shit.</v>

3281
02:32:12.691 --> 02:32:17.691
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about the guy who was in Denver was </v>

3282
02:32:17.691 --> 02:32:18.630
<v Speaker 5>beating the shit out of this guy they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had on the ground because he said he had</v>

3283
02:32:18.631 --> 02:32:23.631
<v Speaker 5>a bag in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's punching him in the face while </v>

3284
02:32:23.631 --> 02:32:26.240
<v Speaker 5>he's holding him down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His pregnant wife comes over to try to </v>

3285
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:26.240
<v Speaker 5>stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They trip his wife,</v>

3286
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:27.060
<v Speaker 5>she falls on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're watching this.</v>

3287
02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:27.630
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3288
02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:32.810
<v Speaker 5>Then they tried to erase the video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guy that already uploaded it to </v>

3289
02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:35.481
<v Speaker 5>the cloud and they released it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed it on television and there's a </v>

3290
02:32:35.481 --> 02:32:38.580
<v Speaker 5>whole lot of fucking really horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that cops do.</v>

3291
02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the homepage of reddit every </v>

3292
02:32:43.970 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

3293
02:32:43.970 --> 02:32:44.520
<v Speaker 5>It's like you see at least one or two </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories that make your,</v>

3294
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 5>make your heart stop and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like many things in this life where </v>

3295
02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.440
<v Speaker 5>you would like things to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>black and white,</v>

3296
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:57.620
<v Speaker 5>and the thing that people gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards turns out to be a massive string</v>

3297
02:32:59.371 --> 02:33:04.371
<v Speaker 5>of contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things wrong with this </v>

3298
02:33:04.371 --> 02:33:04.371
<v Speaker 5>case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first of all,</v>

3299
02:33:04.371 --> 02:33:04.800
<v Speaker 5>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3300
02:33:04.801 --> 02:33:06.570
<v Speaker 5>he was young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was 18 years old.</v>

3301
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:11.220
<v Speaker 5>Hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's responsible for all of his behavior</v>

3302
02:33:11.221 --> 02:33:13.530
<v Speaker 5>at 18 years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you think about what kind of a life</v>

3303
02:33:13.531 --> 02:33:18.531
<v Speaker 5>this kids live in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of an environment he's grown </v>

3304
02:33:18.531 --> 02:33:18.531
<v Speaker 5>up in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But all that said,</v>

3305
02:33:18.531 --> 02:33:23.510
<v Speaker 5>he's robbing a store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just moments before this video of him </v>

3306
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.580
<v Speaker 5>grabbing this guy by the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking huge guy.</v>

3307
02:33:23.850 --> 02:33:26.790
<v Speaker 5>Reaches into the cop's car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punches him in the face,</v>

3308
02:33:26.791 --> 02:33:30.540
<v Speaker 5>is trying to get the cops gun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets shot in the hand at close range.</v>

3309
02:33:30.810 --> 02:33:32.160
<v Speaker 5>All this has been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're.</v>

3310
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:35.630
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with a dangerous bad guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>already for sure.</v>

3311
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:37.100
<v Speaker 5>Has that much been proven?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3312
02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:40.170
<v Speaker 5>So we know that he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know he robbed that store.</v>

3313
02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:42.620
<v Speaker 5>We know he punched the cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know we tried to get the cops gun.</v>

3314
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:47.630
<v Speaker 5>We know the gun discharged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shot him in the hand at very close </v>

3315
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.630
<v Speaker 5>range.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then that if that's the case,</v>

3316
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:51.020
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't strike me as being the best</v>
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>

3317
02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:53.610
<v Speaker 5>but it's a bad exam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still falls under the range of like,</v>

3318
02:33:53.611 --> 02:33:58.611
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you have to end somebody's life or </v>

3319
02:33:58.611 --> 02:33:58.611
<v Speaker 5>could you have just tackled him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3320
02:33:58.611 --> 02:33:58.770
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't tackle them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3321
02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:01.590
<v Speaker 5>he was not physically capable of beating</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kid up or hazed.</v>

3322
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3323
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he had a taser on him,</v>

3324
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:09.950
<v Speaker 5>but I think that was part of his thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he couldn't discharge pepper spray </v>

3325
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:13.371
<v Speaker 5>because he was in the car and the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>punched him in the face and he was </v>

3326
02:34:13.371 --> 02:34:13.770
<v Speaker 5>worried he was gonna lose consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a big fucking kid.</v>

3327
02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:20.140
<v Speaker 5>So there's better examples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck happened in </v>

3328
02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:23.251
<v Speaker 5>the moments before that guy's life was </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken and there's contradicting stories.</v>

3329
02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:26.200
<v Speaker 5>There's people that say that he had his </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands up,</v>

3330
02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:29.620
<v Speaker 5>those people that say he was charging,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when you have that.</v>

3331
02:34:29.621 --> 02:34:31.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fucking tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3332
02:34:31.650 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand people that claim </v>
<v Speaker 5>they do know.</v>

3333
02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:40.320
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the autopsy statements apparently tend </v>

3334
02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.020
<v Speaker 5>to tend to exonerate the cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the autopsy,</v>

3335
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:49.060
<v Speaker 5>the descriptions of the bullet wounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>are supposedly,</v>

3336
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:54.270
<v Speaker 5>from what I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously I'm not a forensic scientist </v>

3337
02:34:54.270 --> 02:34:55.140
<v Speaker 5>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they seemed to indicate this.</v>

3338
02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:00.160
<v Speaker 5>The cop story was a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>kosher that he had a shot on the top of </v>

3339
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.451
<v Speaker 5>his head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which he indicated was charging towards </v>

3340
02:35:03.451 --> 02:35:05.391
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot through his arm in a way that you </v>

3341
02:35:05.391 --> 02:35:05.391
<v Speaker 5>couldn't possibly do if the guy's arms </v>
<v Speaker 5>are up in the air.</v>

3342
02:35:05.391 --> 02:35:07.180
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3343
02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:12.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's people that say they saw him </v>

3344
02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:15.031
<v Speaker 5>with his hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the other thing that's a real </v>

3345
02:35:15.031 --> 02:35:17.401
<v Speaker 5>problem is witness testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People see things that aren't really </v>

3346
02:35:17.401 --> 02:35:17.401
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3347
02:35:17.401 --> 02:35:20.670
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the women on the grand jury,</v>

3348
02:35:20.671 --> 02:35:22.850
<v Speaker 3>the AP story said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3349
02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:27.860
<v Speaker 3>she has racist views,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has trouble differentiating between </v>

3350
02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:29.220
<v Speaker 3>truth and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is read online,</v>

3351
02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:31.230
<v Speaker 3>and this is actually in the AP report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3352
02:35:31.231 --> 02:35:32.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is a person,</v>

3353
02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:37.280
<v Speaker 3>he's one of your witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty flimsy witness right </v>

3354
02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:37.280
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3355
02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.230
<v Speaker 5>there's an interesting radio lab story </v>
<v Speaker 5>this month,</v>

3356
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:44.950
<v Speaker 5>this week rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Radio lab is a really interesting </v>

3357
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:46.250
<v Speaker 5>podcast that I listened to and this one </v>
<v Speaker 5>is about a,</v>

3358
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:51.920
<v Speaker 5>I think it was in Mumbai or Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what part of Africa it was,</v>

3359
02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:57.220
<v Speaker 5>but there was a terrorist attack on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mall and these guys showed up with guns </v>

3360
02:35:58.401 --> 02:36:01.640
<v Speaker 5>and they shot a bunch of people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was all these different eyewitness</v>

3361
02:36:01.641 --> 02:36:06.641
<v Speaker 5>testimonies that were just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was hard to figure out who's telling </v>

3362
02:36:06.641 --> 02:36:07.580
<v Speaker 5>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was 15 gunman.</v>

3363
02:36:07.581 --> 02:36:09.620
<v Speaker 5>There was 10 gunman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3364
02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:14.740
<v Speaker 5>they did a forensic examination of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the video footage from all the </v>

3365
02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:15.950
<v Speaker 5>surveillance cameras and turns out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3366
02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:20.980
<v Speaker 5>four gunman and they were all killed and</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people had these different </v>

3367
02:36:21.051 --> 02:36:25.160
<v Speaker 5>descriptions and they like swore they </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw this and they swore they saw that.</v>

3368
02:36:25.730 --> 02:36:29.420
<v Speaker 5>But when you go over all the video </v>
<v Speaker 5>footage from all the people entering,</v>

3369
02:36:29.421 --> 02:36:31.720
<v Speaker 5>all the people leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the they.</v>

3370
02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:36.470
<v Speaker 5>They have this pretty accurate based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>like real hard evidence.</v>

3371
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:39.920
<v Speaker 5>They've got a 24 hour camera system </v>
<v Speaker 5>going all the time.</v>

3372
02:36:39.921 --> 02:36:44.921
<v Speaker 5>They captured all of it and they spent </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours and hours going over all the </v>

3373
02:36:44.921 --> 02:36:47.030
<v Speaker 5>events and finding out who's the WHO's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shooter.</v>

3374
02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:52.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean they have a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a grid of the entire place so </v>

3375
02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:55.091
<v Speaker 5>they know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet people have all these different </v>

3376
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:56.570
<v Speaker 5>descriptions of young people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of older people,</v>

3377
02:36:56.571 --> 02:36:59.300
<v Speaker 5>people taking off their clothes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>assimilating into society.</v>

3378
02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:02.060
<v Speaker 5>They drop their gun and change their </v>
<v Speaker 5>clothes and they they,</v>

3379
02:37:02.250 --> 02:37:07.250
<v Speaker 5>they escaped like a normal person and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that became a narrative and there was a </v>

3380
02:37:07.250 --> 02:37:07.280
<v Speaker 5>lot of people that believe these </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories,</v>

3381
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:12.550
<v Speaker 5>but when they describe the actual events</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've captured on video to these </v>

3382
02:37:13.761 --> 02:37:15.290
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to it.</v>

3383
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:20.530
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to admit what what is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually on video you could see </v>

3384
02:37:20.530 --> 02:37:20.530
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

3385
02:37:20.530 --> 02:37:20.960
<v Speaker 5>That's not what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what I saw,</v>

3386
02:37:20.961 --> 02:37:23.660
<v Speaker 5>but it's all right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People see things,</v>

3387
02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:26.630
<v Speaker 5>especially under stress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stressful situation,</v>

3388
02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:29.960
<v Speaker 5>a murder taking place and attack on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>police officer.</v>

3389
02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Guns are going off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

3390
02:37:31.941 --> 02:37:33.200
<v Speaker 5>the guy got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see what happened?</v>

3391
02:37:33.201 --> 02:37:34.760
<v Speaker 5>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had his hands up.</v>

3392
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 5>He had his hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw him too.</v>

3393
02:37:36.730 --> 02:37:39.170
<v Speaker 5>He had his hands up and then people </v>
<v Speaker 5>start repeating it,</v>

3394
02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:40.790
<v Speaker 5>hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't shoot like,</v>

3395
02:37:40.791 --> 02:37:41.900
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had his hands up.</v>

3396
02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:44.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he had his hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might've had his hands up,</v>

3397
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:46.160
<v Speaker 5>but to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3398
02:37:46.161 --> 02:37:48.260
<v Speaker 5>he didn't have his hands up or to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3399
02:37:48.261 --> 02:37:49.790
<v Speaker 5>he had his hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3400
02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Unless you were there and if you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3401
02:37:51.711 --> 02:37:52.430
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have to.</v>

3402
02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.110
<v Speaker 5>I say I'd have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need this body camera stuff is going</v>

3403
02:37:56.111 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 5>to solve a lot of problems.</v>

3404
02:37:57.430 --> 02:38:00.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll find an honest cop.</v>

3405
02:38:00.081 --> 02:38:05.081
<v Speaker 5>That should be the first thing you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it means your liabilities now </v>

3406
02:38:05.081 --> 02:38:05.480
<v Speaker 5>dropping the close to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

3407
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:08.510
<v Speaker 5>if you take somebody's life and it turns</v>
<v Speaker 5>out it was justified or you use,</v>

3408
02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:10.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use of force and you need to.</v>

3409
02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Any jury is going to look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

3410
02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:15.230
<v Speaker 5>well you're a cop and you're protecting </v>
<v Speaker 5>the public and a story.</v>

3411
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:20.380
<v Speaker 5>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think ultimately that's going to </v>

3412
02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:22.601
<v Speaker 5>be the great response to all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these horrible situations,</v>

3413
02:38:23.031 --> 02:38:28.031
<v Speaker 5>like the 12 year old kid that was killed</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the fake gun that was just walking </v>

3414
02:38:28.031 --> 02:38:31.511
<v Speaker 5>on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cops pull up within two seconds of </v>

3415
02:38:31.511 --> 02:38:31.511
<v Speaker 5>getting out of their car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This kid's dead.</v>

3416
02:38:31.511 --> 02:38:32.840
<v Speaker 5>They get out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just start shooting them,</v>

3417
02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:38.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the nine one one call says it looks </v>

3418
02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:38.260
<v Speaker 5>like he's got a fake gun.</v>

3419
02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.800
<v Speaker 5>The nine one one call says that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3420
02:38:39.801 --> 02:38:42.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck information </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets the actual cops itself,</v>

3421
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:47.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nine slash 11 operator calls the </v>

3422
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.710
<v Speaker 5>cops and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3423
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:50.291
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck was actually </v>

3424
02:38:50.291 --> 02:38:52.601
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of those situations </v>

3425
02:38:52.601 --> 02:38:55.661
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of those situations just </v>
<v Speaker 5>simply wouldn't take place the same way </v>

3426
02:38:55.661 --> 02:38:56.960
<v Speaker 5>if everyone was wearing cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just wouldn't,</v>

3427
02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:59.270
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There'd be accountability.</v>

3428
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:04.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean cameras on cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like the Internet of law </v>

3429
02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:04.990
<v Speaker 5>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3430
02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 5>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like full accountability,</v>

3431
02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:10.490
<v Speaker 5>full access to information and if those </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking things are streaming,</v>

3432
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:14.720
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what an amazing show that would be.</v>

3433
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:19.870
<v Speaker 5>He'd build a watch cops lives like all </v>
<v Speaker 5>day long and just stream into officer </v>

3434
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:24.041
<v Speaker 5>Wilson's camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Truman show meets cops like you </v>

3435
02:39:24.041 --> 02:39:24.320
<v Speaker 5>think about that.</v>

3436
02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:29.320
<v Speaker 5>Like guys in Compton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like like working the beat in Inglewood,</v>

3437
02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:34.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night doing drug law enforcement or </v>

3438
02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.160
<v Speaker 5>narcotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What'll happen is within a few years </v>

3439
02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:40.070
<v Speaker 5>you'll be watching it and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cops will take down some meth dealer and</v>

3440
02:39:40.071 --> 02:39:41.000
<v Speaker 5>you'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good job.</v>

3441
02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:46.330
<v Speaker 5>The qr code will pop up on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody will send him like a little </v>

3442
02:39:46.330 --> 02:39:49.871
<v Speaker 5>bit of Bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That cop will be set for the year and </v>

3443
02:39:49.871 --> 02:39:51.860
<v Speaker 5>it'll become this thing where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to be a really fair cop because</v>

3444
02:39:51.861 --> 02:39:56.861
<v Speaker 5>everybody's watching the streams for fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>and providing tips to the cops that are </v>

3445
02:39:56.861 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 5>not corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The monetary 10 he'd be right.</v>

3446
02:39:59.030 --> 02:40:00.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean this has maybe like a one percent</v>
<v Speaker 5>chance of happening,</v>

3447
02:40:00.951 --> 02:40:02.450
<v Speaker 5>but I think it'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3448
02:40:02.451 --> 02:40:03.890
<v Speaker 5>one thing that would be cool as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would know,</v>

3449
02:40:03.891 --> 02:40:08.670
<v Speaker 5>like cops that are cool you would know </v>
<v Speaker 5>like who gets people you know,</v>

3450
02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:13.010
<v Speaker 5>gives people fair deals and communicates</v>
<v Speaker 5>with people well and doesn't,</v>

3451
02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:14.310
<v Speaker 5>doesn't abuse his power.</v>

3452
02:40:14.410 --> 02:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say like every interaction I've </v>

3453
02:40:19.410 --> 02:40:21.391
<v Speaker 3>had with a cop in California has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive and I think part of that is it </v>

3454
02:40:21.391 --> 02:40:22.450
<v Speaker 3>in the back of my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>

3455
02:40:22.451 --> 02:40:27.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy could fuck me over if you </v>

3456
02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:27.451
<v Speaker 3>wanted to because I had weed in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like,</v>

3457
02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:29.850
<v Speaker 3>well I'm doing everything that's legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's doing his stuff and like,</v>

3458
02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:30.760
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3459
02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:34.030
<v Speaker 5>and you're white and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white,</v>

3460
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:35.360
<v Speaker 5>white.</v>

3461
02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Not at all denying the a racialist white</v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>

3462
02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.210
<v Speaker 3>the racial profiling that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 3>cops.</v>

3463
02:40:43.211 --> 02:40:48.211
<v Speaker 3>But all I'm saying is living in a state </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm not treated like a criminal </v>

3464
02:40:48.211 --> 02:40:50.500
<v Speaker 3>for doing things that as an adult I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be entitled to do that.</v>

3465
02:40:50.501 --> 02:40:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my own,</v>

3466
02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>just an antidepressant basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't I be allowed to do that?</v>

3467
02:40:55.510 --> 02:41:00.510
<v Speaker 3>The cops here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we agree it's none of our business and </v>

3468
02:41:00.510 --> 02:41:00.510
<v Speaker 3>that to me is a sign of respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I respect them.</v>

3469
02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops in California definitely have a </v>

3470
02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:06.120
<v Speaker 3>different take on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's come a long way.</v>

3471
02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy of mine is a cop like </v>

3472
02:41:10.090 --> 02:41:10.120
<v Speaker 3>years ago would joke around about how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care.</v>

3473
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Marijuana was still fucking arrest them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3474
02:41:14.311 --> 02:41:15.870
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they,</v>

3475
02:41:15.871 --> 02:41:20.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get into that US versus them </v>

3476
02:41:20.871 --> 02:41:23.241
<v Speaker 5>mentality I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we realized how difficult </v>

3477
02:41:23.241 --> 02:41:26.480
<v Speaker 5>it is to be a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think fucking unbelievably hard jobs.</v>

3478
02:41:26.481 --> 02:41:29.970
<v Speaker 5>And you're the scum of the earth like </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes part of the time.</v>

3479
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're,</v>

3480
02:41:30.621 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 5>you're also dealing with incredible </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of pressure.</v>

3481
02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:35.800
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with incredible amounts </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

3482
02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:37.920
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of violent input.</v>

3483
02:41:37.921 --> 02:41:41.310
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>unsee it and you're looking at people in</v>

3484
02:41:41.311 --> 02:41:44.160
<v Speaker 5>a completely different way if you work </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a nightclub.</v>

3485
02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:49.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say if your only interaction with </v>

3486
02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:49.400
<v Speaker 5>people's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a bartender and nightclub,</v>

3487
02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:50.100
<v Speaker 5>you would think that everybody is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>drunk asshole.</v>

3488
02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:52.650
<v Speaker 5>Just maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3489
02:41:52.651 --> 02:41:57.651
<v Speaker 5>if you're a woman who has to wear like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>short leather skirt and show up at a </v>

3490
02:41:57.651 --> 02:41:58.890
<v Speaker 5>fucking honky tonk bar and delivered </v>
<v Speaker 5>drinks,</v>

3491
02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:04.490
<v Speaker 5>your opinion of men is going to be based</v>
<v Speaker 5>on drunks that you see at night in the </v>

3492
02:42:04.490 --> 02:42:09.141
<v Speaker 5>dark who are grabbing ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>act like assholes and spilling shit on </v>

3493
02:42:09.141 --> 02:42:10.470
<v Speaker 5>themselves and then driving home drunk.</v>

3494
02:42:10.470 --> 02:42:11.040
<v Speaker 5>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3495
02:42:11.041 --> 02:42:16.041
<v Speaker 5>they're disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you were a chick who worked the </v>

3496
02:42:16.171 --> 02:42:19.380
<v Speaker 5>front desk at a yoga place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might meet like really cool,</v>

3497
02:42:19.381 --> 02:42:20.920
<v Speaker 5>peaceful people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

3498
02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:23.460
<v Speaker 5>It's all about the environment that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>find yourself in.</v>

3499
02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:28.980
<v Speaker 5>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the environment of being a </v>

3500
02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:29.820
<v Speaker 5>police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of what you're dealing with all day</v>

3501
02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:34.850
<v Speaker 5>is people that are breaking the law and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict and people running away and </v>

3502
02:42:34.850 --> 02:42:35.850
<v Speaker 5>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3503
02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.000
<v Speaker 5>that job is fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

3504
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't just start punching immigrants</v>

3505
02:42:42.331 --> 02:42:44.250
<v Speaker 5>in the face on your first day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3506
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:49.251
<v Speaker 5>you don't like tackle a guy and start </v>
<v Speaker 5>punched in the face because you got a </v>

3507
02:42:49.251 --> 02:42:52.191
<v Speaker 5>heroin bag in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like years and years of stress </v>

3508
02:42:52.191 --> 02:42:57.081
<v Speaker 5>and and build up and just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>craziness had barely keeping it together</v>

<v Speaker 5>Who knows if you're on antidepressants </v>

3510
02:43:03.111 --> 02:43:05.950
<v Speaker 5>or anti this or pro that or adderall.</v>

3511
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:10.950
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them take adderall to try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stay awake and stay sharp and provigils </v>

3512
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:15.831
<v Speaker 5>a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cops are taking that new vigil and </v>

3513
02:43:15.831 --> 02:43:18.751
<v Speaker 5>pro vigil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of police officers like that shit </v>

3514
02:43:18.751 --> 02:43:19.990
<v Speaker 5>because it keeps them sharp and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them are on steroids.</v>

3515
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:25.030
<v Speaker 5>Lot of on steroids now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're doing a lot of </v>

3516
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.120
<v Speaker 5>tests for steroids and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>police department.</v>

3517
02:43:25.121 --> 02:43:26.890
<v Speaker 5>I saw this dude pull this guy over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The guy was so jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>

3521
02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:38.320
<v Speaker 5>He was that level of jacked where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't get there without drugs,</v>

3522
02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:41.080
<v Speaker 5>just like arms are like three times as </v>
<v Speaker 5>big as mine.</v>

3523
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:43.630
<v Speaker 5>Giant ass fucking neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was huge.</v>

3524
02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:47.050
<v Speaker 5>It was huge and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy is a drug user.</v>

3525
02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.200
<v Speaker 5>He's a drug user and he's using illegal </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs and he's pulling people over like </v>

3526
02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:55.270
<v Speaker 5>unless he's doing testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 5>replacement therapy and just like,</v>

3527
02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:58.120
<v Speaker 5>at the very least he's abusing his </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>

3528
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:59.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy's gigantic.</v>

3529
02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:02.650
<v Speaker 5>It's so preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leave large.</v>

3530
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:04.200
<v Speaker 5>That's a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody,</v>

3531
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:07.240
<v Speaker 5>nobody has a problem with that big ass </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking arms and its sleeve.</v>

3532
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:10.210
<v Speaker 5>Nobody has a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>

3533
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:13.840
<v Speaker 5>That's okay because it got a roach in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fucking car salesman get out of the</v>

3534
02:44:13.850 --> 02:44:14.520
<v Speaker 5>car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>son.</v>

3535
02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:16.290
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's that,</v>

3536
02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:17.940
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3537
02:44:19.350 --> 02:44:24.350
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition just puts you in a kind of </v>

3538
02:44:24.350 --> 02:44:24.350
<v Speaker 3>freaked out mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:44:24.750 --> 02:44:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

3540
02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Even in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which most of us can we consider New </v>

3541
02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.200
<v Speaker 3>York to be a civilized city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the cultural capital of the US</v>

3542
02:44:32.220 --> 02:44:34.380
<v Speaker 3>in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're black,</v>

3543
02:44:34.381 --> 02:44:36.840
<v Speaker 3>the stop and frisk thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an expensive,</v>

3544
02:44:36.841 --> 02:44:40.380
<v Speaker 3>like unpleasant process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that discontinued that.</v>

3545
02:44:40.410 --> 02:44:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I think they will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3546
02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.390
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a ruled unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't 100 percent know what the status</v>

3547
02:44:45.391 --> 02:44:48.060
<v Speaker 3>of that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll pull up stop and frisk,</v>

3548
02:44:48.270 --> 02:44:50.580
<v Speaker 3>but that went on for years and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>complete bullshit.</v>

3549
02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3550
02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3551
02:44:54.010 --> 02:44:56.760
<v Speaker 5>stop and Frisk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3552
02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:04.670
<v Speaker 5>mayor says New York City will settle </v>
<v Speaker 5>suits on stop and frisk.</v>

3553
02:45:05.850 --> 02:45:06.220
<v Speaker 8>Hm.</v>

3554
02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:10.740
<v Speaker 5>Stop and Frisk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Appeal is on hold.</v>

3555
02:45:11.310 --> 02:45:12.900
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the latest here.</v>

3556
02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.350
<v Speaker 5>New York City ends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>

3557
02:45:14.370 --> 02:45:16.950
<v Speaker 5>defensive stop and Frisk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So apparently they just.</v>

3558
02:45:16.951 --> 02:45:19.290
<v Speaker 5>So they had dropped the appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3559
02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:22.230
<v Speaker 5>So what it is is apparently there's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much,</v>

3560
02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:28.280
<v Speaker 5>so many lawsuits and so much bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>attached to it that they're probably </v>

3561
02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:28.470
<v Speaker 5>doing it for financial reasons.</v>

3562
02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like California.</v>

3563
02:45:30.661 --> 02:45:32.010
<v Speaker 3>We're letting go of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3564
02:45:32.130 --> 02:45:33.690
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent drug offenders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3565
02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:36.250
<v Speaker 3>That proposition that passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3566
02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the money move to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has nothing to do with morality.</v>

3567
02:45:40.141 --> 02:45:43.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like we don't have the money to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking spend $60,000</v>

3568
02:45:43.381 --> 02:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>for every single person we lock up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3569
02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:47.760
<v Speaker 5>The New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3570
02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:52.770
<v Speaker 5>they're saying mayor Bloomberg's </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration has sought the appeal to </v>

3571
02:45:52.770 --> 02:45:57.231
<v Speaker 5>appeal Judge Korea Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Lynn Lynn's ruling,</v>

3572
02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:02.790
<v Speaker 5>which stated that the New York City </v>
<v Speaker 5>Police Department had abused its power,</v>

3573
02:46:03.210 --> 02:46:06.930
<v Speaker 5>but a de Blasio is working to settle the</v>
<v Speaker 5>case out of court.</v>

3574
02:46:06.931 --> 02:46:08.970
<v Speaker 5>We believe these steps will make </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone safer.</v>

3575
02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Blasio told</v>

3576
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:15.220
<v Speaker 1>New York Brooklyn news conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will be one city where everyone </v>

3577
02:46:16.491 --> 02:46:19.460
<v Speaker 1>rises together where everyone's rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>are protected.</v>

3578
02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3579
02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:23.150
<v Speaker 1>What that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone rises together.</v>

3580
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So his cane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he campaigned,</v>

3581
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:30.790
<v Speaker 1>the new mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayor de blasio campaigned on a promise </v>

3582
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:31.490
<v Speaker 1>to end the era of stop and Frisk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Policing.</v>

3583
02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's gross.</v>

3584
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:36.560
<v Speaker 1>It's gross in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're a young black guy.</v>

3585
02:46:36.561 --> 02:46:38.160
<v Speaker 1>It's horseshit or young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3586
02:46:38.310 --> 02:46:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if women are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed as much.</v>

3587
02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:47.060
<v Speaker 1>They're saying men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying young African American </v>

3588
02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:49.931
<v Speaker 1>and Latino men in specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible to be treated as a </v>

3589
02:46:49.931 --> 02:46:49.931
<v Speaker 1>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything wrong.</v>

3590
02:46:49.931 --> 02:46:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gross.</v>

3591
02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the guy that was walking there was</v>

3592
02:46:52.041 --> 02:46:54.650
<v Speaker 1>just putting his hands in his pockets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a.</v>

3593
02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:57.530
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our world.</v>

3594
02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:01.010
<v Speaker 1>No judging people based on how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much melanin,</v>

3595
02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:06.340
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what part of the world your parents </v>

3596
02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:06.340
<v Speaker 1>might have immigrated from.</v>

3597
02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:06.340
<v Speaker 1>That's part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the world.</v>

3598
02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:10.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a big part of the country where </v>

3599
02:47:10.781 --> 02:47:10.781
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in Colorado,</v>

3600
02:47:10.781 --> 02:47:15.581
<v Speaker 1>just walk into a gift shop and get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to feel happy and nobody's </v>

3601
02:47:15.581 --> 02:47:18.620
<v Speaker 1>gonna racially profile you and fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and that's awesome.</v>

3602
02:47:18.621 --> 02:47:19.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have more stuff like that.</v>

3603
02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But in Colorado that's where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

3604
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I got beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denver Police Department beat the fuck </v>

3605
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.110
<v Speaker 1>out of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a heroin bag in his mouth,</v>

3606
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:30.340
<v Speaker 1>so they'll just escalating other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the thing now?</v>

3607
02:47:30.390 --> 02:47:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Now it's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3608
02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.920
<v Speaker 1>if you have any of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really going to come after you,</v>

3609
02:47:33.921 --> 02:47:35.900
<v Speaker 1>but this one's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe mean.</v>

3610
02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:38.570
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have drug quotas,</v>

3611
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:43.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of a department had quotas on </v>

3612
02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 1>arrests and some of them do and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very controversial.</v>

3613
02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:49.040
<v Speaker 1>There's quotas on speeding tickets as </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotas and all sorts of things that cops</v>

3614
02:47:49.041 --> 02:47:54.041
<v Speaker 1>are told they have to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered what the fuck </v>

3615
02:47:54.041 --> 02:47:54.440
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If no one commits a crime,</v>

3616
02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:57.350
<v Speaker 1>what happens if we all agree like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey everybody,</v>

3617
02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:59.510
<v Speaker 1>can we all keep it together for six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>

3618
02:47:59.511 --> 02:48:04.511
<v Speaker 1>Because if everybody can keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>together for six months and we all make </v>

3619
02:48:04.511 --> 02:48:04.550
<v Speaker 1>a pact that no one speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one litters,</v>

3620
02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:06.620
<v Speaker 1>no one does anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops can arrest you for.</v>

3621
02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:10.640
<v Speaker 1>No one breaks a law for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did the cops do?</v>

3622
02:48:10.970 --> 02:48:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does.</v>

3623
02:48:12.261 --> 02:48:17.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we can do that for a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could use just fred day police </v>

3624
02:48:17.271 --> 02:48:19.460
<v Speaker 1>departments across the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>would fucking panic.</v>

3625
02:48:19.461 --> 02:48:23.330
<v Speaker 1>We nail arrested as to create new laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're an oxygen smuggler,</v>

3626
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you breathe too much oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to take you down.</v>

3627
02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they would likely do?</v>

3628
02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:33.050
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably likely get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspire to do something.</v>

3629
02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:38.160
<v Speaker 1>They would go undercover and then create</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and arrest people for agreeing </v>

3630
02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3631
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go rob that bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you we could make some </v>

3632
02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3633
02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to rob that bank makes money.</v>

3634
02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're show,</v>

3635
02:48:44.421 --> 02:48:46.610
<v Speaker 1>we can make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we can make some money.</v>

3636
02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And they set it all up and then the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3637
02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:50.870
<v Speaker 1>everybody put your hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to rob this bank,</v>

3638
02:48:51.270 --> 02:48:52.970
<v Speaker 1>use your fucking idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3639
02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Like that right now is legal and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now is how they bust people for </v>

3640
02:48:58.180 --> 02:48:58.760
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it all the time.</v>

3641
02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:02.630
<v Speaker 1>They bust people for drugs where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fake drug deals,</v>

3642
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:07.750
<v Speaker 1>where they put people in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant amounts of time for drugs </v>

3643
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought</v>

3644
02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:09.690
<v Speaker 5>they were going to buy and sell these </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

3645
02:49:09.691 --> 02:49:12.120
<v Speaker 5>They get them on conspiracy to buy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sell drugs.</v>

3646
02:49:12.121 --> 02:49:17.121
<v Speaker 5>They believe they're real drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the drugs are just a fiction of the </v>

3647
02:49:17.121 --> 02:49:18.870
<v Speaker 5>dea is imagination and a big part of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>theater that's been put on.</v>

3648
02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:24.170
<v Speaker 5>They do it with terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That mentally challenged guy that they </v>

3649
02:49:24.170 --> 02:49:28.221
<v Speaker 5>arrested a few years back in Dallas was </v>
<v Speaker 5>a perfect example that they gave this </v>

3650
02:49:28.221 --> 02:49:29.520
<v Speaker 5>guy a fake bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Set it up,</v>

3651
02:49:29.521 --> 02:49:34.521
<v Speaker 5>convinced him that you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take this bomb and you're going to </v>

3652
02:49:34.521 --> 02:49:37.020
<v Speaker 5>fucking blow this building up and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>name of a law and they got this mentally</v>

3653
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:38.910
<v Speaker 5>challenged guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>set him up,</v>

3654
02:49:39.450 --> 02:49:41.580
<v Speaker 5>got him to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked him into it,</v>

3655
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:44.640
<v Speaker 5>gave him the fake bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then when he went to detonate it,</v>

3656
02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:45.210
<v Speaker 5>they arrested him.</v>

3657
02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:49.440
<v Speaker 3>But to play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play devil's advocate to play a national</v>

3658
02:49:49.441 --> 02:49:53.310
<v Speaker 3>security state advocate and be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>homelands type character.</v>

3659
02:49:54.270 --> 02:49:57.660
<v Speaker 3>That kind of person who that dumb or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that easily influenced,</v>

3660
02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:01.170
<v Speaker 3>they're going to bounce around and come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up against something ugly at some point.</v>

3661
02:50:01.171 --> 02:50:03.270
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

3662
02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:08.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a fine line with entrapment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that they should be doing </v>

3663
02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:11.361
<v Speaker 3>some of those undercover sting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's how you find out who is </v>

3664
02:50:11.361 --> 02:50:14.961
<v Speaker 3>the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like any normal person would be </v>

3665
02:50:14.961 --> 02:50:14.961
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3666
02:50:14.961 --> 02:50:17.781
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to take the bombs and go </v>

3667
02:50:17.781 --> 02:50:17.781
<v Speaker 3>do the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3668
02:50:17.781 --> 02:50:17.880
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the choice the person makes.</v>

3669
02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:23.240
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those areas where I think </v>

3670
02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:24.360
<v Speaker 3>some of it is going over the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they have to do that too.</v>

3671
02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:29.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea of the wounded </v>

3672
02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:32.751
<v Speaker 5>antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's better to take them out quickly </v>

3673
02:50:32.751 --> 02:50:32.810
<v Speaker 5>before the crocodiles get them at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>waterhole.</v>

3674
02:50:33.010 --> 02:50:34.170
<v Speaker 5>There's some merit to that.</v>

3675
02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3676
02:50:34.981 --> 02:50:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a dumb guy whose mind is fertile</v>

3677
02:50:38.221 --> 02:50:43.221
<v Speaker 3>for radicalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it's better to get the fake </v>

3678
02:50:43.221 --> 02:50:43.221
<v Speaker 3>radicalism than the real thing,</v>

3679
02:50:43.221 --> 02:50:46.220
<v Speaker 5>or figure out a way to let this poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>bastard no,</v>

3680
02:50:46.221 --> 02:50:51.221
<v Speaker 5>that he's stupid and don't listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody because they're going to try </v>

3681
02:50:51.221 --> 02:50:51.221
<v Speaker 5>to get you to blow up a building and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they gonna lock you in a fucking cage.</v>

3682
02:50:51.221 --> 02:50:53.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean that guy right now than a jail </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>

3683
02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:58.180
<v Speaker 5>And he probably will remain that chill </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a long fucking time and there's not </v>

3684
02:50:58.180 --> 02:51:02.351
<v Speaker 5>a lot of recourse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he probably was super excited about </v>

3685
02:51:02.481 --> 02:51:07.481
<v Speaker 5>this new thing that he was involved in </v>
<v Speaker 5>because finally his life had some </v>

3686
02:51:07.481 --> 02:51:10.391
<v Speaker 5>meaning because without that and without</v>
<v Speaker 5>this spiritual connection to this jihad </v>

3687
02:51:10.401 --> 02:51:15.401
<v Speaker 5>that he was about to commit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what kind of a connection did he </v>

3688
02:51:15.401 --> 02:51:15.401
<v Speaker 5>have to his own existence?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3689
02:51:15.401 --> 02:51:18.680
<v Speaker 5>he might've been dancing through life </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely aimlessly,</v>

3690
02:51:18.681 --> 02:51:20.510
<v Speaker 5>always depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always sad,</v>

3691
02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:22.850
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden he's a part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>something exciting,</v>

3692
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:25.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call them his brothers and all have</v>

3693
02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:27.320
<v Speaker 5>shit already.</v>

3694
02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3695
02:51:28.850 --> 02:51:33.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one thing that I've recognized that I'm </v>

3696
02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:33.850
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously I'm not a religious person,</v>

3697
02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:38.650
<v Speaker 5>but one thing that I do recognize when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch me and even religions that have no</v>

3698
02:51:39.501 --> 02:51:42.110
<v Speaker 5>experience in it all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Islamic mosques,</v>

3699
02:51:42.111 --> 02:51:47.111
<v Speaker 5>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're giving these speeches and </v>

3700
02:51:47.111 --> 02:51:47.590
<v Speaker 5>they're talking about the value of Islam</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Islam as the truth and everybody's,</v>

3701
02:51:48.010 --> 02:51:50.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>agreeing and you know,</v>

3702
02:51:50.490 --> 02:51:51.800
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3703
02:51:51.801 --> 02:51:52.610
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll walk by.</v>

3704
02:51:52.611 --> 02:51:54.540
<v Speaker 5>They're all like yelling it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

3705
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:58.100
<v Speaker 5>there's this feeling of camaraderie </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's very attractive about that.</v>

3706
02:51:58.310 --> 02:52:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Even if you know what's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if you know it doesn't make any </v>

3707
02:52:03.310 --> 02:52:03.310
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's scientology,</v>

3708
02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:04.780
<v Speaker 5>even if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3709
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:09.990
<v Speaker 5>mormonism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you got a big group of people </v>

3710
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:09.990
<v Speaker 5>that agree on something and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3711
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:11.950
<v Speaker 5>fucking completely committed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3712
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:13.480
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be in with those guys.</v>

3713
02:52:13.810 --> 02:52:18.810
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a part of you that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be in that group because there's a lot </v>

3714
02:52:18.810 --> 02:52:19.840
<v Speaker 5>of energy in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're committed to it,</v>

3715
02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:24.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all saying the same old ancient </v>

3716
02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:25.210
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Allah walk chanting it together.</v>

3717
02:52:25.211 --> 02:52:27.370
<v Speaker 5>Like there's power in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3718
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:29.440
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because Islam is the truth and everybody</v>

3719
02:52:29.441 --> 02:52:33.250
<v Speaker 5>claps and you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3720
02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:35.650
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the draw of that,</v>

3721
02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:37.270
<v Speaker 5>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tangible to me.</v>

3722
02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:39.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm not joining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to join,</v>

3723
02:52:39.790 --> 02:52:44.790
<v Speaker 5>but I would be lying if I said that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't see the appeal of the comradery </v>

3724
02:52:45.611 --> 02:52:48.700
<v Speaker 5>of any sort of a group that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely committed to.</v>

3725
02:52:48.930 --> 02:52:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something really </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive,</v>

3726
02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:53.370
<v Speaker 3>attractive about being the person to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand back and be like,</v>

3727
02:52:53.371 --> 02:52:55.110
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all fucking shit.</v>

3728
02:52:55.860 --> 02:52:56.670
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3729
02:52:56.671 --> 02:52:58.890
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's definitely,</v>

3730
02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:01.200
<v Speaker 3>that'd be the person in the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 3>who has,</v>

3731
02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter on your phone and Google News </v>

3732
02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:09.650
<v Speaker 3>and you can see the limitations of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>fed this angry radicalism based on some </v>

3733
02:53:10.381 --> 02:53:13.950
<v Speaker 3>stuff that happened a thousand years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use that too.</v>

3734
02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3735
02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:20.280
<v Speaker 5>does that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is the opposite of </v>

3736
02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:20.280
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that I see the appeal</v>

3737
02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:22.450
<v Speaker 5>of joining these organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want to be a part of it.</v>

3738
02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Clam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the most wanted man?</v>

3739
02:53:25.350 --> 02:53:25.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

3740
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:28.770
<v Speaker 3>It was a Philip Seymour Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his last movie,</v>

3741
02:53:28.771 --> 02:53:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I just saw it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good,</v>

3742
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:32.370
<v Speaker 3>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a slow,</v>

3743
02:53:32.490 --> 02:53:36.570
<v Speaker 3>realistic version of a homeland episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they're in Hamburg,</v>

3744
02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Germany and he's this counterterrorism </v>
<v Speaker 3>spy and they're tracking these a Muslim </v>

3745
02:53:42.301 --> 02:53:47.301
<v Speaker 3>radicals through Hamburg and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a case against one of them and so </v>

3746
02:53:47.301 --> 02:53:51.951
<v Speaker 3>it really is like you see them more </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe realistic or maybe less glamorous </v>

3747
02:53:51.951 --> 02:53:56.100
<v Speaker 3>side of counterterrorism and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least based on this movie,</v>

3748
02:53:56.101 --> 02:54:01.101
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of hanging around mosques and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out who the bad guys </v>

3749
02:54:01.101 --> 02:54:01.101
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3750
02:54:01.101 --> 02:54:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there's a lot of that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to infiltrate,</v>

3751
02:54:02.700 --> 02:54:04.860
<v Speaker 3>if you're really trying to become a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their movement,</v>

3752
02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:07.080
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point is it's a really good movie and it</v>

3753
02:54:07.081 --> 02:54:12.081
<v Speaker 3>gets you to see like just how fucked it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that these young guys get into these </v>

3754
02:54:12.511 --> 02:54:17.511
<v Speaker 3>mosques and stuff and then become </v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced by charismatic personalities </v>

3755
02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:21.110
<v Speaker 3>and can do a lot of damage and it's the</v>

3756
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:26.110
<v Speaker 5>pattern that's been established.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pattern that's been established was </v>

3757
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.900
<v Speaker 5>one of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide bombings and you know,</v>

3758
02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:30.920
<v Speaker 5>when that pattern becomes established,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what people sort of accept.</v>

3759
02:54:30.921 --> 02:54:33.170
<v Speaker 5>If that was that existed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity,</v>

3760
02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Christianity was overwhelmed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide bombings and you know you and </v>

3761
02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:39.410
<v Speaker 5>people really believe they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>heaven,</v>

3762
02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:41.450
<v Speaker 5>they blew themselves up in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>marketplace.</v>

3763
02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:45.080
<v Speaker 5>You'd you'd see similar behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a human pattern.</v>

3764
02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:47.360
<v Speaker 5>It's when these patterns get </v>
<v Speaker 5>established,</v>

3765
02:54:47.361 --> 02:54:50.810
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult to break them off </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's.</v>

3766
02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:56.070
<v Speaker 5>It's weird how some get established,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not logical like human </v>

3767
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:59.120
<v Speaker 5>patterns can be completely illogical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human patterns can involve cutting holes</v>

3768
02:54:59.121 --> 02:55:02.210
<v Speaker 5>in your lips and putting plates in them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stretching them out.</v>

3769
02:55:02.390 --> 02:55:07.390
<v Speaker 5>That's a a human pattern that somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 5>another got adopted and the size of the </v>

3770
02:55:07.390 --> 02:55:11.030
<v Speaker 5>plate became directly proportionate to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of cows you're worth when you</v>

3771
02:55:11.031 --> 02:55:11.750
<v Speaker 5>get married.</v>

3772
02:55:12.140 --> 02:55:14.780
<v Speaker 5>That's so unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you saw that on paper,</v>

3773
02:55:14.781 --> 02:55:17.450
<v Speaker 5>if somebody proposed that as an episode </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a television show,</v>

3774
02:55:17.451 --> 02:55:20.720
<v Speaker 5>that there's these people that we run </v>
<v Speaker 5>into and there are a tribe and they have</v>

3775
02:55:20.721 --> 02:55:22.140
<v Speaker 5>a plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stick in their lives.</v>

3776
02:55:22.190 --> 02:55:23.240
<v Speaker 5>Why would they put a plate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Lip?</v>

3777
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:24.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the bigger the plate,</v>

3778
02:55:24.681 --> 02:55:26.690
<v Speaker 5>the more cows there'll be worth when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they get married.</v>

3779
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:28.850
<v Speaker 5>The Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a stupid plot point.</v>

3780
02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:34.090
<v Speaker 5>People wouldn't even agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would say that's a dumb idea for a </v>

3781
02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:35.480
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile that is a very real thing.</v>

3782
02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:37.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people exist.</v>

3783
02:55:37.311 --> 02:55:40.280
<v Speaker 5>There's many photos of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They knock out their lower teeth,</v>

3784
02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:43.430
<v Speaker 5>the plates fit in better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

3785
02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:48.790
<v Speaker 5>So patterns don't have to be logical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just have to exists and people slip</v>

3786
02:55:48.801 --> 02:55:50.720
<v Speaker 5>right into him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the,</v>

3787
02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:54.560
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the semen people of New Guinea where</v>

3788
02:55:54.561 --> 02:55:59.561
<v Speaker 5>they force young boys to ingest their </v>
<v Speaker 5>semen because it's going to make them </v>

3789
02:55:59.561 --> 02:56:00.410
<v Speaker 5>grow stronger and healthier.</v>

3790
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:03.080
<v Speaker 5>They call themselves the semen warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they really?</v>

3791
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:08.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the most lookup semen warriors of </v>

3792
02:56:08.110 --> 02:56:11.411
<v Speaker 5>New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is one of the strangest fucking </v>

3793
02:56:11.411 --> 02:56:13.790
<v Speaker 5>places in the world and you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about thousands of people,</v>

3794
02:56:13.970 --> 02:56:18.970
<v Speaker 5>thousands of people that do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They take the sun from the mom at an </v>

3795
02:56:18.970 --> 02:56:19.330
<v Speaker 5>early age and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3796
02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:22.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new male companion,</v>

3797
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:25.430
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>starts but fucking them in mouth.</v>

3798
02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how they,</v>

3799
02:56:27.001 --> 02:56:30.170
<v Speaker 5>they tell them they have to do this in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order for them to grow strong.</v>

3800
02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:33.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking crazy and that's a pattern.</v>

3801
02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:39.220
<v Speaker 5>That pattern is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it exists and it exists in a strange </v>

3802
02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:40.280
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's there.</v>

3803
02:56:40.310 --> 02:56:45.310
<v Speaker 5>They're isolated and you can study them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and people have gone in there and </v>

3804
02:56:45.951 --> 02:56:50.951
<v Speaker 5>examine their culture enough that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>write on it and they have in detailed </v>

3805
02:56:50.951 --> 02:56:52.550
<v Speaker 5>descriptions from people that have gone </v>
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>

3806
02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:55.250
<v Speaker 5>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That does sound extremely naughty.</v>

3807
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:57.790
<v Speaker 5>It's people are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>David Seaman.</v>

3808
02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:03.280
<v Speaker 5>Crazy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why we got to get people a </v>

3809
02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:04.310
<v Speaker 5>upgraded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get them on bitcoin.</v>

3810
02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Do you in this fucking Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're making me anti bitcoin.</v>

3811
02:57:09.090 --> 02:57:11.900
<v Speaker 5>One bitcoin out of your fucking mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your solution for everything.</v>

3812
02:57:11.901 --> 02:57:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mushrooms in Bitcoin.</v>

3813
02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:16.280
<v Speaker 5>That's what you should sell a t shirt </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

3814
02:57:16.281 --> 02:57:17.350
<v Speaker 5>David Seaman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dotcom.</v>

3815
02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:19.550
<v Speaker 5>Mushrooms in Bitcoin and bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3816
02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of mushrooms the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the New York Times,</v>

3817
02:57:22.761 --> 02:57:27.761
<v Speaker 5>the home page of the New York Times had </v>
<v Speaker 5>an op Ed on mushrooms like very forward </v>

3818
02:57:27.801 --> 02:57:30.350
<v Speaker 5>thinking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and millions of people are reading that.</v>

3819
02:57:30.351 --> 02:57:31.640
<v Speaker 5>If it's on the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3820
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Things are changing while they're being </v>
<v Speaker 5>forced to catch up.</v>

3821
02:57:34.250 --> 02:57:35.760
<v Speaker 5>The Internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3822
02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:39.260
<v Speaker 5>Johns Hopkins University,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we publish that study many years ago,</v>

3823
02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:45.100
<v Speaker 5>the one about people that were taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin and had their lives changed </v>

3824
02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:49.451
<v Speaker 5>for the better permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's been Mtma studies that had been </v>

3825
02:57:49.451 --> 02:57:49.490
<v Speaker 5>released,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's a lot of studies.</v>

3826
02:57:49.491 --> 02:57:54.491
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're being forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The were overwhelming amount of </v>

3827
02:57:54.491 --> 02:57:57.761
<v Speaker 5>information that's coming out there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>being forced to address it now in </v>

3828
02:57:57.761 --> 02:58:00.521
<v Speaker 5>mainstream publications.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The CNN piece Iowasca Sanjay Gupta's </v>

3829
02:58:00.810 --> 02:58:04.200
<v Speaker 5>pieces and is complete 180 degree </v>
<v Speaker 5>turnaround on marijuana.</v>

3830
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:07.420
<v Speaker 3>What's weird is when people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>critics go,</v>

3831
02:58:07.421 --> 02:58:12.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not really connecting to some </v>

3832
02:58:12.421 --> 02:58:12.650
<v Speaker 3>like global universal mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just done.</v>

3833
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:18.030
<v Speaker 3>You're just ingesting the substance that</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows the two hemispheres of your mind </v>

3834
02:58:18.030 --> 02:58:18.130
<v Speaker 3>to communicate better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I go,</v>

3835
02:58:18.131 --> 02:58:20.560
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why aren't I allowed to use that?</v>

3836
02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's something that's,</v>

3837
02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:27.080
<v Speaker 3>it's improving my cognitive ability or </v>
<v Speaker 3>improving my mind's ability to figure,</v>

3838
02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:28.870
<v Speaker 3>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3839
02:58:28.871 --> 02:58:31.600
<v Speaker 3>deep seated challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with that?</v>

3840
02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:32.840
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't.</v>

3841
02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:36.390
<v Speaker 5>There's no bodies and people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>dying of mushrooms and on top of that,</v>

3842
02:58:36.391 --> 02:58:37.950
<v Speaker 5>the people that say you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3843
02:58:37.951 --> 02:58:41.370
<v Speaker 5>you're just doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you have personal experience in,</v>

3844
02:58:42.020 --> 02:58:44.820
<v Speaker 5>in like heavy duty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breakthrough level,</v>

3845
02:58:44.821 --> 02:58:49.821
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you have one of those under your </v>

3846
02:58:49.821 --> 02:58:52.881
<v Speaker 5>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really don't know what you're </v>

3847
02:58:52.881 --> 02:58:52.881
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

02:58:52.881 --> 02:58:54.940
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're guessing on what it's like and </v>

3849
02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:57.081
<v Speaker 5>what it's like is so far beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 5>capabilities of your imagination that </v>

3850
02:58:57.110 --> 02:59:02.110
<v Speaker 5>this is a ridiculous conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is like a blind person trying to </v>

3851
02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:04.080
<v Speaker 5>describe to you what the universe looks </v>
<v Speaker 5>like and like you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and you can't say you can.</v>

3854
02:59:08.231 --> 02:59:11.670
<v Speaker 5>When you get your eyes fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come to me and I'll explain to you why I</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll show you what the draft looks like </v>
<v Speaker 5>in real life,</v>

3857
02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:19.050
<v Speaker 5>but right now you're just guessing.</v>

3858
02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:22.500
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker can't figure out what a </v>
<v Speaker 5>giraffe looks like with your fingers.</v>

3859
02:59:22.770 --> 02:59:25.580
<v Speaker 5>You got to put a lot of data together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We tried to get a blind man,</v>

02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:30.620
<v Speaker 5>draw a picture of a giraffe after you </v>
<v Speaker 5>let them fucking handle this giraffe </v>

3861
02:59:30.620 --> 02:59:32.040
<v Speaker 5>fondling and a giraffe Dick and reached </v>
<v Speaker 5>out the draft,</v>

3862
02:59:32.041 --> 02:59:37.041
<v Speaker 5>like getting on a fucking step ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reaching all the way up to the top of </v>

3863
02:59:37.041 --> 02:59:37.041
<v Speaker 5>the draft patent net like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3865
02:59:41.991 --> 02:59:44.211
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

02:59:44.211 --> 02:59:44.590
<v Speaker 5>grown out of it.</v>
