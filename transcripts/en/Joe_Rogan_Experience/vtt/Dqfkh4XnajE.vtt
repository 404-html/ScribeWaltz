00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But it's just like those same people who will be like a year like against women,</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>like I would never in a million years go out to a show and be like,</v>

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just rooting for the men today.</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

7
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this way.</v>

8
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like on team man,</v>

9
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but you are on team women.</v>

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just,</v>

11
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>it just seems to me that there's a lot of that going on.</v>

12
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:22.801
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

13
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that shit where it's like you kind of projected this thing that you see</v>

14
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>racism everywhere or you see sexism everywhere.</v>

15
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.260
<v Speaker 1>But all I really see is you fucking lecturing people based on race and send</v>

16
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.841
<v Speaker 1>their mind.</v>

17
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to do it the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to have brown pride</v>

18
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>and his chest kind of same thing.</v>

19
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll,</v>

20
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you're disenfranchised or you're marginalized so you're allowed to stay.</v>

21
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.421
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not,</v>

22
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you playing that victim card as a woman and you're allowed to say,</v>

23
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to support my girl.</v>

24
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking about this on stage of the day.</v>

25
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bumper sticker on a car.</v>

26
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>It said girls kick ass.</v>

27
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.003
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

28
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.353
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

29
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>some of them are lazy slobs.</v>

31
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I like what are you gonna Align yourself with?</v>

32
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>150 million women just in this country alone.</v>

33
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.834
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

34
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying if a guy had a bumper sticker,</v>

35
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>it said boys kick ass.</v>

36
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>He be like follow that guy and find out where he's been fucking these kids.</v>

37
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

38
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:11.671
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

39
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you never say boys,</v>

40
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>boys kick ass.</v>

41
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You put that on your bumper.</v>

42
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So where the fuck are you?</v>

43
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.551
<v Speaker 1>You'd pull them over.</v>

44
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.361
<v Speaker 1>Let me see your license.</v>

45
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:19.141
<v Speaker 1>Where do you live man?</v>

46
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for a living?</v>

47
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>What's that bumper sticker about?</v>

48
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do you mean by that?</v>

49
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>And I don't need,</v>

50
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>like I almost feel like an asshole sometimes where I preface everything with a</v>

51
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>disclaimer like,</v>

52
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying this and I'm not,</v>

53
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but I just want it to be clear that I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to</v>

54
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the rule,</v>

55
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's also kind of strange to me that like if you want to celebrate women,</v>

56
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>why are you celebrating such a masculine quality?</v>

57
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it's kind of like,</v>

58
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

59
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.311
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

60
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>there are white players who are great basketball players,</v>

61
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>There are white.</v>

63
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>The Dark Novitsky was an amazing basketball player,</v>

64
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but if I just wrote somewhere like white people kick ass at basketball,</v>

65
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.551
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

66
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.384
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

68
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>well this is that movie coming on in general.</v>

69
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Women don't kick ass in general.</v>

70
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

71
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a male thing to do.</v>

72
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's not exceptions to that,</v>

73
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>

74
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you're writing white people kick ass in basketball.</v>

75
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of misleading.</v>

76
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same feelings about cultural appropriation as some people do</v>

77
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>with fucking braids.</v>

78
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

80
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

81
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's the United States,</v>

83
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>We're sending over super sensitive.</v>

85
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten various senses.</v>

86
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is,</v>

87
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>it all comes from a litigious culture that's,</v>

88
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>oh absolutely.</v>

89
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you can get sued for anything anybody can sue you at anytime.</v>

90
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>That's just like,</v>

91
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>that's American culture.</v>

92
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

93
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.561
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

94
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

95
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>you pissed off someone like enough,</v>

96
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.753
<v Speaker 1>you can sue them.</v>

97
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of like suing,</v>

98
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:34.861
<v Speaker 1>swinging,</v>

99
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>swinging enough successful cases along the way.</v>

100
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.851
<v Speaker 1>That's part of,</v>

101
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fear based operating system.</v>

102
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

103
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Hauling people on Shit maybe they didn't even think was bad.</v>

104
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of like someone,</v>

106
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>like it's a good service to be able to sue someone if you needed to.</v>

107
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>However it's abused up the Ying Yang and there's like professional lawyers,</v>

108
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they have billboards everywhere.</v>

109
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>But do you think Katy Perry who was worried about being sued?</v>

110
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

111
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that I'm saying that the sensitivity issue,</v>

112
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.520
<v Speaker 1>like why,</v>

113
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>why we're so white American culture is so like PC at this point because there's</v>

114
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

115
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it kind of goes hand in hand.</v>

116
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sense of,</v>

117
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

118
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

119
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm at a loss for words a little bit to stoned,</v>

120
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

121
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>but I will say it's having that litigious fear based kind of motivator or it</v>

122
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>causes people to want to correct things like to correct course,</v>

123
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

124
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.480
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

125
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.770
<v Speaker 1>to a form of something that works for everyone to avoid being sued too.</v>

127
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>not me,</v>

129
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>not directly,</v>

130
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>not directly,</v>

131
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>but that thought process.</v>

132
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:37.554
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

134
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

135
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that mindset.</v>

136
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because it's about like,</v>

137
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:40.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

138
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>well how can we make this,</v>

139
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>we have to include everybody on this,</v>

140
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>which I believe in.</v>

141
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>But absolutely.</v>

143
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

144
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but I think it should be done out of a sense of empathy and not to say that,</v>

146
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

147
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

148
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>people fighting for rights to have handicap parking like in the front of the</v>

150
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.370
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

151
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Like there's thing that's just a great idea.</v>

152
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

153
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that the,</v>

154
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>what were you,</v>

155
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>you were kind of referring to that sensitivity come,</v>

156
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>comes from that where someone's like afraid of doing something wrong.</v>

157
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>And it just starts feeding back and feeding back,</v>

159
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:12.671
<v Speaker 1>feeding back.</v>

160
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you get people so fearful of any choice that they're making.</v>

161
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.981
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>

162
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Was it Roosevelt who tried to,</v>

163
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

164
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.793
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

165
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 1>southerners weren't lazy.</v>

166
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Just infected with hookworms.</v>

167
00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:26.960
<v Speaker 1>A story of the postbellum south as told by parasites.</v>

168
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

169
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It makes your teeth fall out and it needs more brain,</v>

171
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

172
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Stereotypes are almost always the conclusion of Lazy Science.</v>

173
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>They're just empirical generalizations that are stripped of their variances and</v>

174
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>encoded as fact and to the collective consciousness of the general population.</v>

175
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>They're the two Bubba,</v>

176
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.921
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

177
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

178
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

179
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:45.361
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

180
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

181
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.901
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

182
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the stereotype reveals a hidden truth that provides an origin to the</v>

183
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

184
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>The trope of the Lazy Southerner dates back to America's postbellum period</v>

185
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>following the end of the civil war.</v>

186
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows where it came from,</v>

187
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:02.811
<v Speaker 1>but the image of [inaudible] filthy drawling farmer has pervaded art literature</v>

188
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>and pop your culture until up until this very moment.</v>

189
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.480
<v Speaker 1>So one argument recently published by Rachel,</v>

190
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>newer for PBS Nova tax present some compelling evidence for the theory that a</v>

191
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 1>hookworm epidemic was responsible for the rural stereotype holding holy</v>

192
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

193
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Germ of laziness through the exhaustion mental fogginess attends to inflict upon</v>

194
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:23.501
<v Speaker 2>its victims.</v>

195
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Historical evidence shows that the parasite ravaged the American south</v>

196
00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>throughout the early 20th century as a result of poor sanitation and lack of</v>

197
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>public health programs among the poor,</v>

198
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>whole crazy by 1905 the parasite ologist.</v>

199
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a job.</v>

200
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm a joke.</v>

201
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Topologist Charles says,</v>

202
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>as we have 40% or more,</v>

203
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>not 60% I was wrong of the southern population was infected with hookworms.</v>

204
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 2>The parasite thrives and fecal matter and the combination of shoddy waste</v>

205
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>disposal in the rarity of shoes,</v>

206
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.981
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>

207
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>no shoes allowed hookworm larvae to enter people's bodies through the webbing</v>

208
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>between their toes.</v>

209
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:56.524
<v Speaker 2>How Fun.</v>

210
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Once they penetrate the skin,</v>

211
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 2>they traveled through their hosts lungs into their intestines where they survive</v>

212
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>on a diet of blood,</v>

213
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>they suck out from the intestinal wall of female.</v>

214
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Hookworm can lay up to 10,000 eggs in a single day,</v>

215
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>which gives you an idea of how ramping a localized infestation can become an a</v>

216
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.954
<v Speaker 2>very short time.</v>

217
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 2>The laziness that is synonymous with hookworm.</v>

218
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Hookworm infections is a synonym of iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss.</v>

219
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

220
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Getting bled out.</v>

221
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

222
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 2>40% of people were anemic and had blood loss.</v>

223
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 2>The poor malnourished victims,</v>

224
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the parasite can cause stunted growth.</v>

225
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.650
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

226
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

227
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>children with hookworms,</v>

228
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>we're plagued with attention deficit disorders,</v>

229
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>lower Iq and the infected often had strange food cravings for dirt,</v>

230
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 2>clay paper and chalk.</v>

231
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>How nuts is that?</v>

232
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Southern states where the nexus of hookworm friendly climate is the parasite</v>

233
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 2>loved the sandy soil that makes a real with the region.</v>

234
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.194
<v Speaker 2>So for at all,</v>

235
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.981
<v Speaker 2>in 1910,</v>

236
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 2>7.5 million southerners had hookworms.</v>

237
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

238
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.870
<v Speaker 2>How nuts is that?</v>

239
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

240
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:51.644
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

241
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

242
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Rockefeller is who donated money to try to combat it,</v>

243
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>but dusty Illuminati,</v>

244
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>isn't he like a,</v>

245
00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:59.940
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is all scam,</v>

246
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.380
<v Speaker 2>50 years for the worm to be eradicated from the south.</v>

247
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:06.480
<v Speaker 2>1960 it was eradicated.</v>

248
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

249
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Because of the sanitation issues.</v>

250
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

251
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Almost entirely freed from hookworms by 1985 yeah,</v>

252
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>that was [inaudible] 20 years ago.</v>

253
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 3>That's so recently.</v>

254
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Speaker 3>It's completely insane.</v>

255
00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:19.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

256
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Is that nuts?</v>

257
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

258
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.331
<v Speaker 3>It's never,</v>

259
00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:23.580
<v Speaker 3>she's going to grab my head and forced me to eat her pussy.</v>

260
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

261
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.021
<v Speaker 3>great thought though,</v>

262
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

263
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Being made to do it.</v>

264
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my greatest turnout.</v>

265
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.883
<v Speaker 3>Stick your tongue</v>

266
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.120
<v Speaker 3>in your mouth</v>

267
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.380
<v Speaker 3>or have someone do that.</v>

268
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It was all right.</v>

269
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Not Bad.</v>

270
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Not that.</v>

271
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.711
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

272
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I had a girl when I had to go and try it.</v>

273
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.351
<v Speaker 3>I tell you this,</v>

274
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:52.260
<v Speaker 3>she's trying to push a fart out and she shot monistat seven on my chest.</v>

275
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

276
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking horrible.</v>

277
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Monistat seven or something.</v>

278
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Girls putting their vaginal infection.</v>

279
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

280
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.343
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

281
00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Not My best moment.</v>

282
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.443
<v Speaker 3>What it smell like?</v>

283
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it had a smell.</v>

284
00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember having a smell to explain that it was monistat.</v>

285
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I knew exactly what it was.</v>

286
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Speaker 3>We both knew what it was,</v>

287
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.183
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

288
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.133
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

289
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.901
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad,</v>

290
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad scene,</v>

291
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.500
