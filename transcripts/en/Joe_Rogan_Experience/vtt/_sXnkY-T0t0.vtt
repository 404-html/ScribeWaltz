00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>You're so good at breaking shit down,</v>

3
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:04.704
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you said that there was not a hint of bias there.</v>

6
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>You were being completely honest about it.</v>

7
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

8
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I really value that in the way you talk.</v>

9
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

10
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was really happy when a,</v>

11
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I watched that Kamau bell show em Kamau Bell Come Matt,</v>

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I totally biased for command Melia,</v>

13
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>which was a w w Kamau Bell,</v>

14
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you and Lindy West,</v>

15
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Lindy West who's a,</v>

16
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>a feminist blogger for Jezza bell,</v>

17
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a feminist website.</v>

18
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>And what I loved about it man was first of all,</v>

19
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you never got upset.</v>

20
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

21
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you were rational and logical and you had,</v>

22
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.341
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

23
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about it in a very measured way and you're being really</v>

24
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>friendly while you were discussing this and you know,</v>

25
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:50.784
<v Speaker 1>in her,</v>

26
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>in her defense,</v>

27
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a very tricky subject to breach for a woman.</v>

28
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And she was saying a lot of shit like comedy clubs are filled with rooms filled</v>

29
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>with angry men and he didn't,</v>

30
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even flinch.</v>

31
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

32
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>he didn't go after her.</v>

33
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>she had like these digs about like,</v>

35
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:06.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to joke about it,</v>

37
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm allowed to tell you're a dick.</v>

38
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.311
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

40
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't think she lacked,</v>

41
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>she hadn't,</v>

42
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the blog wasn't about me.</v>

43
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It was about a guy who,</v>

44
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>any guy making addiction or certain rape jokes that put,</v>

45
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>and this is the tricky part of Lindy West,</v>

46
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>he's a lot of people would say she's against,</v>

47
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.531
<v Speaker 1>she's for censorship,</v>

48
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:23.364
<v Speaker 1>but she really wasn't.</v>

49
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>She was about,</v>

50
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>she didn't like the jokes that she thought minimalize the victim in a rape right</v>

51
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>now it's hard to logically say,</v>

52
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

53
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.801
<v Speaker 1>minimalize you.</v>

54
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>The victim of rape is a good thing.</v>

55
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.951
<v Speaker 1>But she,</v>

56
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.391
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

57
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>what people forget,</v>

58
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they went after Sam morale,</v>

59
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of jokes or just misdirection.</v>

60
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a comedian in New York who had done some like domestic violence jokes or</v>

61
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

62
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>But in a misdirection joke,</v>

63
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.863
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

64
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.823
<v Speaker 1>you go for the,</v>

65
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.131
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

66
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>the most obvious or opposite thing.</v>

67
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

68
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's like I did one joke and this didn't come up in that show,</v>

69
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but like I was talking about,</v>

70
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.381
<v Speaker 1>seeing it a girl,</v>

72
00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:58.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

73
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she had a good time or it was raped in a Porta potty.</v>

74
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna go through the whole joke before,</v>

75
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was at a concert and outdoor concert.</v>

76
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So the two most opposite things I could think of if I said I didn't know if she</v>

77
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>had a good time or not a very good time,</v>

78
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit fuck hill raped in a Porta potty?</v>

79
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.423
<v Speaker 1>Painting a picture.</v>

80
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>If I said I didn't know if she was beaten in a Porta potty or raped in a Porta</v>

81
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>potty,</v>

82
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>nobody would've laughed because they're too close.</v>

83
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.101
<v Speaker 1>So the fact,</v>

84
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm explaining this to the audience,</v>

86
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>not jus the fact that you take two things at a such polar opposites.</v>

87
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the polar opposite you land on for the joke is a horrible thing that</v>

88
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>minimalizes the victim and a,</v>

89
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>every Catholic priest joke is somehow minimalizing the victim part.</v>

90
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Comedy does that.</v>

91
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that it has to just be speaking truth to power.</v>

92
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of it.</v>

93
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>But I think that as long as your intention is genuinely to be funny and not to</v>

94
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>humiliate a person for real,</v>

95
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's allowable.</v>

97
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And it has to be because it gets to be too subjective after that.</v>

98
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>it's an art form.</v>

100
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't like that art form,</v>

101
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I completely and totally understand that,</v>

102
00:02:59.541 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to participate to participate in the shelves.</v>

104
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.214
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go.</v>

105
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>But when you're,</v>

106
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you're being hypercritical about and trying to get people to stop doing it,</v>

107
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make it so that,</v>

108
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>that our form is not available.</v>

109
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the really fucked up thing that you don't mean art form is not available.</v>

110
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Just like rap music.</v>

111
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

112
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>what is going on in rap music?</v>

113
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Or they're really running around killing people and selling cocaine every day.</v>

114
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.571
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

115
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Most of what they're doing is talking shit about something.</v>

116
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

117
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's no different than the movie Scarface.</v>

118
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really died in that movie.</v>

119
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.191
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

121
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you're painting a picture.</v>

122
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:32.224
<v Speaker 1>It's a gross,</v>

123
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>horrific picture.</v>

124
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>But some people like that,</v>

125
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they like to watch Scarface than like the listen to rap music.</v>

126
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>They want to hear a dirty comic,</v>

127
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>say horrendous,</v>

128
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate things that are fucked up.</v>

129
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorites is auto,</v>

130
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>auto and George.</v>

131
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>He would say some of the most fucked up,</v>

132
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous over the top shit.</v>

133
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why I did it is because that's like what shocks is shit out of</v>

134
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you and makes you laugh when you least expect it.</v>

135
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:56.891
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

136
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>well crafted in on time.</v>

137
00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Top of that.</v>

138
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 1>He made me laugh harder than anybody's ever made me laugh in a club.</v>

139
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 1>We were doing a pizzeria in Pennsylvania and he said something.</v>

140
00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:05.031
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

141
00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>it was barbarism.</v>

142
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And it made me,</v>

143
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>it was because of the imagery was such,</v>

144
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

145
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.151
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

146
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it was such poetry that he flew off the top with and it was awful.</v>

147
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

148
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>have you ever told you this story?</v>

149
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

150
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.831
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

151
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

152
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

153
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:20.511
<v Speaker 1>it won't hold,</v>

154
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.131
<v Speaker 1>like if I say it now,</v>

155
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna be the greatest jokey,</v>

156
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but the beauty of it,</v>

157
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.140
<v Speaker 1>we were in a pizzeria.</v>

158
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It was an awful gig.</v>

159
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

160
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.163
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

162
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.251
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

163
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:29.084
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.811
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

165
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.670
<v Speaker 1>we're like real pizzeria bench seats.</v>

166
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It stunk.</v>

167
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

168
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.591
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

169
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:33.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

170
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 1>there was a bar next to it and I'm watching it autos just up there,</v>

171
00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:38.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking struggling and hating it.</v>

172
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.640
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of this dirty act,</v>

173
00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:41.151
<v Speaker 1>the bookers,</v>

174
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Griffin walks down the aisle with her seven year old son,</v>

175
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.690
<v Speaker 1>which was so inappropriate.</v>

176
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And everybody looked at it,</v>

177
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>just derails the show.</v>

178
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.093
<v Speaker 1>And Auto,</v>

179
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

181
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.510
<v Speaker 1>cause everyone looked at this.</v>

184
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:57.530
<v Speaker 1>So the fucking,</v>

185
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the puppet addressed it and said,</v>

186
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

188
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

189
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I make a,</v>

190
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.383
<v Speaker 1>isn't that cute?</v>

191
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I like to grab him by the ankles and smashes Skoll onto a fucking sink.</v>

192
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And it was a calligrapher reference to the end of Caligula.</v>

193
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And it made me the,</v>

194
00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

195
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

196
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the speed at which he put those words together and the,</v>

197
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:17.751
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

198
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the violence attached to that.</v>

199
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.571
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

200
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>and the imagery of that.</v>

201
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It May,</v>

202
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I've never laughed wider.</v>

203
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Anything anybody's ever said in a comedy club because I knew what had just</v>

204
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 1>happened is it was just,</v>

205
00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I immediately saw the end of calendula where they go,</v>

206
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 1>they grab the ankles and they smash the fucking head into the steps.</v>

207
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like the genius to pull that out in this moment.</v>

208
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And where did that quickly,</v>

209
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

210
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.091
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

211
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

212
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>it was beauty.</v>

213
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:40.221
<v Speaker 1>It was beauty,</v>

214
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was a horror and nobody laughed.</v>

215
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Of course they didn't</v>

216
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>fulfill the pizzeria.</v>

217
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

218
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>nobody understood how funny that was.</v>

219
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.801
<v Speaker 1>He had just said that,</v>

220
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 1>and I hadn't seen calendula.</v>

221
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I might not have laughed as hard,</v>

222
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that I immediately saw he did with it,</v>

223
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

224
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to hug him for that.</v>

225
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.461
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant,</v>

226
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.121
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>

227
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant fuck man.</v>

228
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>He's a very funny guy.</v>

229
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And his style of comedy,</v>

230
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>much like dice is style,</v>

231
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>colony is ridiculous over the top things.</v>

232
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't really mean like dice has a some bit about about how a woman gets</v>

233
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>pregnant and it's,</v>

234
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:17.651
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

235
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most hilarious,</v>

236
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous bits because it goes into like this medical or how you can make a gay</v>

237
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:24.314
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

238
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>like how,</v>

239
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>like it's so fucking ridiculous idiocy.</v>

241
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It's completed.</v>

242
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's hilarious.</v>

243
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And for people to say that that's a homophobic joke,</v>

244
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.870
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

245
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

246
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe.</v>

247
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't mean a word.</v>

248
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:36.704
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

249
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>do you understand that this is,</v>

250
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>this is like an art piece that you're watching.</v>

251
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>This is just a ridiculous over the top art piece.</v>

252
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And for you to say that it's not,</v>

253
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>if you to say that I shouldn't be enjoying it,</v>

254
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>well then we have to go with a fine tooth comb over virtually all of pop</v>

255
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

256
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>every song.</v>

257
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>We have to find out what the true meaning behind movies are.</v>

258
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>What's the implication on society?</v>

259
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Because he can't just be humor.</v>

260
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

261
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

262
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a dumb way of looking at it because you know,</v>

263
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

264
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>If it's a standup comedy show,</v>

265
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking joke.</v>

267
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>At least in that sense.</v>

268
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse with a rap music with a rap song like,</v>

269
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:16.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

270
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not a joke.</v>

271
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's being serious with a movie.</v>

272
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they trying to promote that lifestyle.</v>

273
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's real.</v>

274
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a standup comedy show.</v>

275
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why people are laughing is because it's a joke.</v>

276
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>people do know that,</v>

278
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's unfunny people attempting to influence these people trying to influence</v>

279
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>what you said.</v>

280
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same mentality and I don't mean individually like let's just say</v>

281
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>the same mentality that would target dice or that would say,</v>

282
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

283
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you should get in trouble for a gay jug.</v>

284
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I the exact same people who would stand up and defend Maple Thorpe that the same</v>

285
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>people who would defend piss Christ and say that the national endowment of the</v>

286
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 1>arts should have paid for piss Christ because he'll tell people what that is.</v>

287
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,</v>

288
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.191
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

289
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:54.431
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

290
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it's at the NEA and I think paid for,</v>

291
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>it was an artist who pissed into a jar and he put a crucifix in it and he called</v>

292
00:07:59.121 --> 00:07:59.954
<v Speaker 1>it piss Christ.</v>

293
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.351
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

294
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's particularly clever,</v>

295
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't offend me on any level.</v>

296
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And here's more and consistency.</v>

297
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the same people that clever.</v>

298
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

299
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

300
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:07.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

302
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.013
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have mind.</v>

303
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would have thought of that.</v>

304
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:10.401
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

306
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fill a jar with my pis has been like,</v>

307
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>took weeks.</v>

309
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I really would.</v>

311
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>A big jar too.</v>

312
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.213
<v Speaker 1>It's very impressive.</v>

313
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

314
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:16.971
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

315
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a two kegger but,</v>

316
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:18.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

317
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.011
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he,</v>

318
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>that they support that and at the same people who would have attacked Giuliani</v>

319
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>for going after the fucking Brooklyn Museum of art because a guy put African</v>

320
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:28.140
<v Speaker 1>artists painted a,</v>

321
00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>the Virgin Mary and Dung,</v>

322
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>so they would call him a fascist for that.</v>

323
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

324
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

325
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

326
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

327
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand art if you're a maple Thorp,</v>

328
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>but you don't understand art if your TAC piss Christ.</v>

329
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

330
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 1>if you attack a comment,</v>

331
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>well that conduct is insensitive and he's saying something racial,</v>

332
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it may actually insensitive or,</v>

333
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 1>or gender attentive and he should be a t.</v>

334
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's inconsistency.</v>

335
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't fucking respect,</v>

336
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>respected.</v>

337
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't acknowledge any of it with respect.</v>

338
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It's people have to,</v>

339
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to leave room for art.</v>

340
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds ridiculous when you're talking Dick Jokes or any kind of jokes,</v>

341
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but you have to leave room for art because that's what it is,</v>

342
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>is just an art.</v>

343
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't appreciate that style of art,</v>

344
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than you deciding to go to a Metallica show and not liking the</v>

345
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:06.721
<v Speaker 1>lyrics,</v>

346
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:06.931
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:07.651
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like it,</v>

348
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like it.</v>

349
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There's Jodie Mitchell is playing down the block.</v>

350
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:11.401
<v Speaker 1>Go see that.</v>

351
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:11.611
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

352
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

353
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>go see Sheryl crow or go see Dave Matthews.</v>

354
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variety out there,</v>

355
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

356
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it's something that someone creates and when I know says,</v>

357
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to pick them up by his fucking ankles and slammed his head into a sink</v>

359
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and you're laughing.</v>

360
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>That means he delivered art to the person who likes that art.</v>

361
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And I feel the same way when I,</v>

362
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>when I see,</v>

363
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.731
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

364
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>when I saw dykes or when I saw you,</v>

365
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:34.861
<v Speaker 1>and Austin,</v>

366
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:35.694
<v Speaker 1>same feeling.</v>

367
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy ridiculous over the top humor.</v>

368
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.511
<v Speaker 1>It's my,</v>

369
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite things to watch.</v>

370
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So when someone comes along and says,</v>

371
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't do jokes about violence against children cause it's fucked up.</v>

372
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>

373
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>

374
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>You can it even if your kid had been killed.</v>

375
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Well unfortunately for you,</v>

376
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 1>this one hit home and it's not fun to you,</v>

377
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>but everybody else doesn't have a kid that was killed by slamming their head</v>

378
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>into a sank.</v>

379
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It becomes fun for them and it sucks,</v>

380
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just stop the art form because it's going to hit you.</v>

381
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that came up in the conversation with Lindy,</v>

382
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Lindy,</v>

383
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.641
<v Speaker 1>Lindy West,</v>

384
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.031
<v Speaker 1>Lindy West.</v>

385
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Yet one of the things that came up the conversation with her was that she was</v>

386
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:18.441
<v Speaker 1>talking about rape jokes and meanwhile she had a photo on her Twitter of Jeff</v>

387
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Goldbloom who is in Deathwish with an n w who he had enacted,</v>

388
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 1>had really horrific rape scene at barbaric rapes in,</v>

389
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.311
<v Speaker 1>scary,</v>

391
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>

392
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>no joke.</v>

393
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>There was no jokes involved.</v>

394
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.951
<v Speaker 1>There was no hee.</v>

395
00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>He ha ha no double entendres.</v>

396
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And yet an actor doing that in that piece of art somehow or another is</v>

397
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:45.381
<v Speaker 1>exonerated from the impact and this idea that you should know that one third of</v>

398
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the audience I think is those,</v>

399
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>the current thing they're enjoying banding about when people talk about,</v>

400
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say they're enjoying,</v>

401
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to dismiss it,</v>

402
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but the people who really believe this believe that one third of all women have</v>

403
00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>been either sexually assaulted or raped and there's people that dispute that and</v>

404
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it is based on a certain study from,</v>

405
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:09.921
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was 1987 and there was a lot of questions are very controversial in</v>

406
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that study.</v>

407
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they'd say if you ever had sex with someone then regretted it or we are</v>

408
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>recover coerced into having sex and things along those lines.</v>

409
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>They called all of those rates and so then I think,</v>

410
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>but I think their findings was like one in five but now people are saying it's</v>

411
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>one in three whenever the fuck it is.</v>

412
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you have to like not,</v>

413
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to censor yourself because of the,</v>

414
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to,</v>

415
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to,</v>

416
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>if that's your style of comedy,</v>

417
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to,</v>

418
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but for you to get mad at someone who doesn't choose to,</v>

419
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

420
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

421
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you're [inaudible].</v>

422
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>This is a slippery slope and I know people don't think it's a slippery slope</v>

423
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>because you think it's all just about protecting people's feelings,</v>

424
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>especially victim's feelings.</v>

425
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And I see your point,</v>

426
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day we're going to have to go over this whole mother</v>

427
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>fucker with a fine tooth comb.</v>

428
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do that,</v>

429
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you can't just single out stand up comedy because it's coming from one person</v>

430
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>and not a giant movie where a woman gets assaulted and beaten or raped or</v>

431
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

432
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of it has to be looked at.</v>

433
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

434
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at the whole thing.</v>

435
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>See I and I also feel like I give myself the same credit,</v>

436
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>like give the audience like I really do.</v>

437
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:14.681
<v Speaker 1>And it's like we all say,</v>

438
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>we want to just just treat people like you want to be treated well.</v>

439
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I treat the audience with the same level of intellectual respect that I want.</v>

440
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And I went and saw Joan Rivers and I am not,</v>

441
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>it's the edgiest set I've ever seen a comic do.</v>

442
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.311
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

443
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a few years ago at the cutting room in New York,</v>

444
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 1>she's doing nine 11 jokes.</v>

445
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Ai Mean fucking brutal.</v>

446
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

447
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

448
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.291
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

449
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I literally wanted to cry at the end of it because I'm like,</v>

450
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that is what we should be doing.</v>

451
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It is taking everything horrible that we experience.</v>

452
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And I mean horrible and making a roomful of people laugh about it.</v>

453
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And when we walked out of there,</v>

454
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>my feelings about nine 11 did not change my feelings about rape,</v>

455
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 1>my feelings about aids,</v>

456
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>not one thing she said made me value those real experiences.</v>

457
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Less not one thing she said made me devalue anything,</v>

458
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>made me lose respect for the horror of Nile.</v>

459
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Nothing changed for me other than I was able to temporarily laugh at something</v>

460
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that I knew was awful.</v>

461
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't I give my audience the same credit for being able to come to the</v>

462
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>conclusion I came to watching Joan Rivers?</v>

463
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

464
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

465
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.541
<v Speaker 1>it to,</v>

466
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 1>to take their argument,</v>

467
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>it would be because you haven't been raped,</v>

468
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been murdered,</v>

469
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>he didn't lose loved ones in nine 11.</v>

470
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And that what you should be doing by omitting rape jokes is you should be</v>

471
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>avoiding triggers.</v>

472
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>You get PTSD triggers,</v>

473
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:34.780
<v Speaker 1>avoiding people freaking out and thinking about the rape while they're out of</v>

474
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>comedy show.</v>

475
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Just try and have a good time.</v>

476
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.241
<v Speaker 1>And so their,</v>

477
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 1>their opinion is set up entirely to protect the victims of these crimes.</v>

478
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a person,</v>

479
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>like you has a certain sensibility about nine 11 Joan Rivers defies that</v>

480
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:47.951
<v Speaker 1>sensibility,</v>

481
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but does it in a humorous way.</v>

482
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And you walk away with the same opinions that you had going in.</v>

483
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's not where really what you're dealing with,</v>

484
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you'd where you're dealing with is a victimization crime,</v>

485
00:13:56.051 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>a crime or someone's been dehumanized and them being in the audience watching</v>

486
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you talk about that,</v>

487
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 1>you should be more sensitive than that.</v>

488
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's there are there points that very good argument and a lot of ways my</v>

489
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>point back to them would be,</v>

490
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I do understand that.</v>

491
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.671
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>

492
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 1>whenever I talk about tiger woods,</v>

493
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 1>his text messages,</v>

494
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I reveal my own,</v>

495
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I talk about my own.</v>

496
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I also talk about things that have injured me.</v>

497
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I talk about my own suicide attempts to my own sexual proclivities like so I</v>

498
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>include,</v>

499
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>well you do you certain things horrible and things that have affected me and</v>

500
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:26.794
<v Speaker 1>things that haven't,</v>

501
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

502
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I exclude things.</v>

503
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And if you break down humor like that,</v>

504
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:32.171
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

505
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>fine tooth comb,</v>

506
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 1>every single joke or 90% of the jokes you do,</v>

507
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>unless you're talking about balloons are bouncing a ball,</v>

508
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>have hurt somebody.</v>

509
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Well he's talking about De,</v>

510
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:43.601
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

511
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>was I drunk driving?</v>

512
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

513
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.270
<v Speaker 1>children being killed by drunk driving is not.</v>

514
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>If we get that literal with humor,</v>

515
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>then almost all jokes,</v>

516
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:53.410
<v Speaker 1>comics towel are,</v>

517
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>are going to be up for a,</v>

518
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>a careful examination.</v>

519
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think Matt and Trey said it too.</v>

520
00:14:58.481 --> 00:14:59.314
<v Speaker 1>They're all okay.</v>

521
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.051
<v Speaker 1>We're none of,</v>

522
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.830
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

523
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I won't make pedophile jokes when Kevin fucking bacon can't play them in the</v>

524
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:05.500
<v Speaker 1>woodsmen.</v>

525
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

526
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I won't do gun jokes when fucking Hollywood can't tell me how bad guns are.</v>

527
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.541
<v Speaker 1>And then they can move.</v>

528
00:15:10.541 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>He called two guns with too,</v>

529
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>which I have no objection to,</v>

530
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 1>but then don't fucking preach to me about guns motherfuckers.</v>

531
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:17.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like just,</v>

532
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you do as an artist,</v>

534
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone as an artist.</v>

535
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.311
<v Speaker 1>I don't tell you what to do.</v>

536
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.031
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me what to do.</v>

537
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:23.864
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

538
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

539
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it's your point is dead on.</v>

540
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.673
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

541
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

542
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a very important point.</v>

543
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:29.541
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

544
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea of censorship.</v>

546
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that people don't want someone in the audience to be impacted</v>

547
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>negatively about you making light of something that's a horrific crime that</v>

548
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 1>they've suffered from personally.</v>

549
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you should stop.</v>

550
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

551
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean that you're a dick either.</v>

552
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 1>What it means is you're saying something that hits them personally and you know,</v>

553
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you shouldn't go see Jim Norton.</v>

554
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds like a fucked up thing to say.</v>

555
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 1>But really that's,</v>

556
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.781
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

557
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality of the situation.</v>

558
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're doing is a style of art.</v>

559
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>People who don't want to be scared don't go see the conjuring or the evil dead</v>

560
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:05.751
<v Speaker 1>because they don't like,</v>

561
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't like horror movies.</v>

562
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>How come nobody's trying to stop horror movies?</v>

563
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>People that don't like them don't go to see them at the same way she'd be with</v>

564
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:14.480
<v Speaker 1>certain types of humor.</v>

565
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>And what's,</v>

566
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.251
<v Speaker 1>when you break it down,</v>

567
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst that can happen if you see something like,</v>

568
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>am I going to talk about something that they don't shell on law and order</v>

569
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>constantly?</v>

570
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.841
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

571
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the whole things up.</v>

572
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking rape murder fest.</v>

573
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And we think people like it is a rape or a murder or some kind of voyeurism and</v>

574
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I will acknowledge and honor people's Ah,</v>

575
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

576
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>porridge to violence.</v>

577
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>When does an accident in the southbound lane and the traffic in my lane doesn't</v>

578
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:41.024
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>

579
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.750
<v Speaker 1>People slow down to look because they want to see it.</v>

580
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They want to fucking see it on some level,</v>

581
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 1>but they don't admit they want to see it.</v>

582
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>And I hate their lack of admission.</v>

583
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

584
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird exclusion thing too.</v>

585
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:53.651
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

586
00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>you're discussing rape and you're not discussing murder,</v>

587
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.290
<v Speaker 1>if you even have anything that involves a rape in a tweet or something,</v>

589
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:02.691
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

590
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you're a piece of shit.</v>

591
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

592
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:04.631
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

594
00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:05.331
<v Speaker 1>should've had a tour,</v>

595
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>a trigger warning in there.</v>

596
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:06.801
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

597
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 1>this is the attitude that a lot of people are taking it off this stuff.</v>

598
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 1>But why does it have,</v>

599
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't anybody have the same issues about murders?</v>

600
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.840
<v Speaker 1>You can talk about a murder.</v>

601
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.561
<v Speaker 1>You can talk.</v>

602
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:16.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

603
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.383
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

604
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that people get upset at murder jokes or murder movies or</v>

605
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:22.574
<v Speaker 1>anything murder.</v>

606
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.140
<v Speaker 1>But there was a Obama thing recently where Obama said that,</v>

607
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:27.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>he could have been Trayvon Martin and I said,</v>

609
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

610
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you know who else he could have been?</v>

611
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It can be the little kid that got killed by drones,</v>

612
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

614
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>

615
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

616
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a a,</v>

617
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

618
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a joke per se,</v>

619
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

620
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like blocking him.</v>

621
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

622
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

623
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it's mocking the idiocy of this,</v>

624
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also bringing up murder.</v>

625
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.010
<v Speaker 1>It's bringing up people getting hit with missiles.</v>

626
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>No body's exploding.</v>

627
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Why is that image any less disturbing than the image of rape?</v>

628
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Are they,</v>

629
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 1>are they equally disturbing or they both off the menu?</v>

630
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Or why are we only going with rape off the menu?</v>

631
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>How come there's like zero push to take murder off the menu?</v>

632
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Their argument with BB King and then again,</v>

633
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.710
<v Speaker 1>this is what they would say is because rape or murder victims or people murder</v>

634
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not taught to be silent about murder.</v>

635
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

636
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You're taught to be silent about rape and there's a lot of rape victims who are</v>

637
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>too scared to report the crime.</v>

638
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>No one is scared to report a murder lists a mob thing,</v>

639
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

640
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.840
<v Speaker 1>They're saying the perception of the crime is different and our,</v>

641
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>there's such a shame with it where there's not as shame with murder.</v>

642
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 1>This is not a shame with these other things.</v>

643
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.513
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

644
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I heard what she said and I listened to it and I did get it,</v>

645
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>but I won't,</v>

646
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't do a whole shitload of jokes on rape victims anyway.</v>

647
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

648
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 1>but if that's the case and it probably is the case then be for castration of</v>

649
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 1>rape rapists or,</v>

650
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 1>or fight the fact that the recidivism rate is so high in these fucking pigs</v>

651
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>because they're being let out of jail,</v>

652
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 1>like fight that.</v>

653
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

654
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about what dump contributing to a fucking rape culture is nonsense.</v>

655
00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And it is to say comedian contributes to rape culture is simply bullshit.</v>

656
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's simplistic thinking.</v>

657
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of saying I don't like what you're saying and I don't want you to say</v>

658
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

659
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 1>but I can't come out with that.</v>

660
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 1>So I have to find a higher reason which makes it sound like you shouldn't say it</v>

661
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:13.554
<v Speaker 1>for this reason.</v>

662
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

663
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>even the term rape culture,</v>

664
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 1>someone of my message bird said,</v>

666
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>do they have like meetings?</v>

667
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:19.890
<v Speaker 1>They have a magazine.</v>

668
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Like is it really a culture?</v>

669
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

670
00:19:21.831 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

671
00:19:22.781 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>And by calling it that,</v>

672
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 1>by defining it in those terms,</v>

673
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>calling it rape culture,</v>

674
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.131
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

675
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 1>you put quotes around that it starts to be real.</v>

676
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

677
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that it's going to encourage people to rape,</v>

678
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the idea that there is a culture that supports rape is going to be</v>

679
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:39.120
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

680
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be something that people dress as if it's real,</v>

681
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.890
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether or not it is.</v>

682
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it real that people rape?</v>

683
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.441
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

684
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.161
<v Speaker 1>but it is a real,</v>

685
00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>that our culture supports it.</v>

686
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no man.</v>

687
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:50.454
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

688
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.913
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

689
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.123
