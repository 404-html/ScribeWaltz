00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.791
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>you and you were married at the time and you were getting divorced while we were</v>

6
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:08.784
<v Speaker 1>doing the show.</v>

7
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

8
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life and not just to Phil</v>

10
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.821
<v Speaker 1>Hartman divorce thing,</v>

11
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:15.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:15.511
<v Speaker 1>scared me.</v>

13
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>But Dave thinks carried me.</v>

14
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why Dave scenes things scared me was you do not want to</v>

15
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>get fucking married in Canada because when you break up in Canada,</v>

16
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>say you decide you want to get a divorce,</v>

17
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't legally get divorced until you're separate for a year,</v>

18
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

20
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

21
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember.</v>

22
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a year.</v>

23
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It's tattooed in my brain because I remember thinking how crazy this was that</v>

24
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you were fucked.</v>

25
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And what was happening was his wife,</v>

26
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>his first wife,</v>

27
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.000

29
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>at Accenture character and she decided to start taking this shit all over the</v>

31
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:49.741
<v Speaker 1>fucking world,</v>

32
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>or a content on the radio.</v>

33
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:52.164
<v Speaker 1>I would have gone with that.</v>

34
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.801
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

35
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you're a great guy and I want to say,</v>

38
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

39
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't excuse that.</v>

40
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Does that is not a get out of get out of countries.</v>

41
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>she was very odd and uh,</v>

44
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.271
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>the first season the guys were together and then I believe by the second season</v>

46
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.534
<v Speaker 1>it was over.</v>

47
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

50
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:13.771
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

51
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:14.604
<v Speaker 1>we split up.</v>

52
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And so she started,</v>

53
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>what she would do is spend all days money.</v>

54
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>So Dave would be working and she would spend all day,</v>

55
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>it's money,</v>

56
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean by crazy expensive furniture fly all around the world all the time.</v>

57
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>So whenever Dave wanted to see his kids,</v>

58
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>he used to have to get fucking malaria shots.</v>

59
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>So one time we were at one of these NBC things and Dave's fucked up on malaria</v>

62
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>medication and gin and tonics or whatever the fuck you were drinking.</v>

63
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>And you get like,</v>

65
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>

66
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop Dave from beating a guy up.</v>

67
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I had to step in between.</v>

68
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the big guy with the long hair with the fucking dawn Jovi's</v>

69
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.243
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

70
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.951
<v Speaker 1>Tony Carry.</v>

72
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:53.784
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

73
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that the guy had done anything wrong.</v>

74
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It was just the malaria medication.</v>

75
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>You become a psychotic,</v>

76
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a very common uh,</v>

77
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.913
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

78
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially apparently when you mix it with alcohol.</v>

79
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

81
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

82
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 2>and then you added that having made two trips to Africa.</v>

83
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.010

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.343
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

86
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.370

87
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I had to fly to,</v>

88
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I had to fly to Morocco at Thanksgiving and so we had two weeks off of it.</v>

89
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.114
<v Speaker 2>So I had floated,</v>

90
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.433
<v Speaker 2>flew to uh,</v>

91
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>and this again.</v>

92
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

93
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>when we first separated,</v>

94
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 2>she took the kids,</v>

95
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 2>we just said we'd like a summer sent mom divorce where it was like I need to</v>

96
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:29.110
<v Speaker 2>take the children to the continent and gather my thoughts.</v>

97
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 2>So she like traveled through Europe with,</v>

98
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99

100
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 2>two and a half year old for six months.</v>

101
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.941
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

105
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 2>then another 24 hours flying back.</v>

116
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>when I made her get into therapy,</v>

117
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:04.990

<v Speaker 2>and so since we got,</v>

124
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

125
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.961
<v Speaker 2>let's go to therapy.</v>

126
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.111
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

127
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.201
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

128
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go first.</v>

129
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can go see the therapist at the traffic.</v>

131
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>So she goes in and explains to the therapist that I'm an abusive husband,</v>

133
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.430
<v Speaker 2>and then she starts pulling any,</v>

136
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.531
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

137
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>being physically abusive.</v>

138
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

139
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>and then she starts like phoning my family and friends and saying that</v>

140
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>physically abusive or complete fabrications.</v>

141
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:36.281
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

142
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So she's just creating stories.</v>

143
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>A good friend of mine,</v>

144
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

145
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.500

146
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.131
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

147
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

148
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>if Dave was abusive,</v>

149
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>she would be dead.</v>

150
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

151
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.931
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

152
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 2>but then I go into therapy and the therapist goes,</v>

153
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>who is prepared for this abusive husband and to walk in.</v>

155
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

156
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

157
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.271
<v Speaker 2>and she explained to me later,</v>

158
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 2>she said it was very weird because you walked in and you didn't match the</v>

159
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>description of you at all.</v>

160
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's just said when you walked in yet.</v>

161
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>And I saw you two together,</v>

162
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I immediately realized that if anyone in this couple was abused,</v>

163
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

164
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.663
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

165
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>it was me.</v>

166
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Did the therapist say this to her?</v>

167
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.691
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

168
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she ever said it to her in therapy.</v>

169
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a one on one with the third?</v>

170
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I have one on one with it.</v>

171
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.691
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

172
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>we both saw her individually and together.</v>

173
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And then after,</v>

174
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

175
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 2>about six months of therapy,</v>

176
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

177
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

178
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 2>when I thought things were starting to get better cause I was,</v>

180
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I was able to do things like go CD shopping with Steve,</v>

181
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:33.740
<v Speaker 2>without getting,</v>

183
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>without that being a huge fight when I got home,</v>

184
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.711
<v Speaker 2>so that was like,</v>

187
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

188
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.251
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

189
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit of freedom here.</v>

190
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I can go out and hang out with,</v>

191
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 2>hang out with my friends for a little bit without there being a huge fight.</v>

192
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

193
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 2>but then she was diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder by our</v>

194
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.501
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

195
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 2>That exactly mean why is it borderline personality disorder?</v>

196
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a misnomer.</v>

197
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Really don't like it.</v>

198
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>They used to,</v>

199
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>they used to think it was because it was a condition that bordered on being</v>

200
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 2>psychotic.</v>

201
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.713
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.441
<v Speaker 2>and now it's,</v>

203
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.274
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

204
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>they know that isn't the condition.</v>

205
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not anything to do with psychosis.</v>

206
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>But the name has stuck.</v>

207
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>The problem with my problem with the name is when you say borderline personality</v>

208
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

209
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>do you have a fucking personality disorder or not?</v>

210
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 2>What is borderline?</v>

211
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of weird kind of.</v>

212
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Cause in fact borderline's a lot of therapists when even treat them cause they,</v>

213
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>they think they're just impossible to treat and that they're horrible people to</v>

214
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.184
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>

215
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 2>You know that they're incredibly dishonest.</v>

216
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>The pathological liars.</v>

217
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 2>How do you define it though?</v>

218
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>How can you define certain sets of mental illness?</v>

219
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean who was it a judgment call?</v>

220
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>

221
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 2>was the Dsm,</v>

222
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.721
<v Speaker 2>is that what it's called?</v>

223
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 2>The diagnostic standards manual or something like that.</v>

224
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's got like a checklist and if you score a certain number on the</v>

225
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:51.371
<v Speaker 2>checklist,</v>

226
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

227
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>that's a diagnosis.</v>

228
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.861
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

229
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

230
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 2>she had like nine at a 10 on the checklist for borderline.</v>

231
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Was she always this way or did she change?</v>

232
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>She was always that way.</v>

233
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

234
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Like basically as soon as we became a couple,</v>

235
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>like before we were a couple,</v>

236
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 2>she was like my,</v>

237
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.223
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

238
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.021
<v Speaker 2>before she did,</v>

239
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>she was my best friend's girlfriend.</v>

240
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

241
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

242
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 2>it's Karma son.</v>

243
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

244
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

245
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

246
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you got hooked up with Karma.</v>

247
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of these things where it's like,</v>

248
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>did she break up with him first and then go out with you or you can,</v>

249
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

250
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.701
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

251
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of these things where I sort of said,</v>

252
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:24.261
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

253
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

254
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>we should stop hanging out so much cause I'm,</v>

256
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I was like feeling bad about it.</v>

258
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I was like 20 years old and at that point kind of lonely and desperate and said,</v>

259
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:35.451
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

260
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I've got these feelings and we should stop hanging out together alone.</v>

261
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.361
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

262
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 2>You actually said I have these feelings and we should stop hanging out.</v>

263
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 2>How many guys will do that?</v>

265
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Very few.</v>

266
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.701
<v Speaker 2>And her,</v>

268
00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>her reaction to that was the,</v>

269
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

270
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>she just showed me her tits and started kissing me.</v>

271
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

272
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

273
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:51.524

276
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.851
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

277
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

278
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>so what happens then you go to the buddy and go,</v>

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

283
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

284
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I tried to cool it,</v>

285
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 2>tried to get out of it and I even was out of town for a while and tried to stay</v>

286
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:08.391
<v Speaker 2>away from it.</v>

287
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>thank God.</v>

291

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't til she and I hooked up like,</v>

298
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:23.061
<v Speaker 2>cause again,</v>

299
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>as soon as we hook cause borderlines when they love you,</v>

300
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 2>you're the most beautiful,</v>

301
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>perfect thing in the world.</v>

302

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

304
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 2>but then after that,</v>

305
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 2>like if anything is wrong,</v>

306
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 2>then you suddenly become the most evil,</v>

307
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:35.781
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

308

<v Speaker 2>horrible thing in the world and they can't,</v>

309
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 2>they can't see the two at the same time,</v>

310
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 2>they can't see your flaws and your,</v>

311
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 2>and your virtues.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I've dated somebody.</v>

315
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Every girl you remember that you'd like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was wonderful for me.</v>

322
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Speaker 2>It was like I had my own soap opera going on,</v>

323
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 2>but it was also just like this where,</v>

324
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.561
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

325
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>when Shit went down,</v>

326
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.444

00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can work through this.</v>

332
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.221
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

333
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the key signals of a borderline,</v>

403
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck and you think for some reason or that this person is a part of your</v>

404
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.051
<v Speaker 2>it was like this,</v>

412
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guilt about how we started course.</v>

413
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually,</v>

414
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.883
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

415

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 2>your brain doesn't function properly,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I got to the point where I was so crazy,</v>

431
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:12.091
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

432
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:12.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

433

<v Speaker 2>And that's how crazy.</v>

440
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.393
<v Speaker 2>And literally,</v>

441
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 2>within less than a month after my son was born,</v>

442
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

447
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you left me,</v>

00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I would still kill myself.</v>

450
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

451
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.873
<v Speaker 2>she could read my mind.</v>

452

<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

453
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.100

<v Speaker 2>I have a look.</v>

458
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 2>At that time I was like,</v>

459
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 2>when tabs and I split up,</v>

460

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>That was before we had like a separation agreement.</v>

464
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Half a million a year.</v>

00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 2>And you have to make a million to spend a half a million.</v>

470
00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.390
<v Speaker 2>She was renovating the house constantly to be heard,</v>

474
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:10.391
<v Speaker 2>to be heard and that she rescate re lance had the backyard re landscape twice</v>

475
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 2>cause she decided she didn't like where the Koi pond was.</v>

476
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.060

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

481
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing I've always thought about killing whenever we get around to</v>

482
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:22.670
<v Speaker 2>lead.</v>

486
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 2>That was at our argument,</v>

487
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.861
<v Speaker 2>our argument.</v>

488

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

490

<v Speaker 2>The kids need a Koi pond.</v>

491
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Kids need to go to Morocco.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a half a million dollars renovating a fully renovated house.</v>

497
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Well this is why I brought this up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I ran into you on Twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I saw you on Twitter and one of the first things I saw you on Twitter was you</v>

500
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 2>talking about how you had just gotten,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the court had just told you you have to pay three times your monthly salary in</v>

504
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.463
<v Speaker 2>alimony.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

506

<v Speaker 2>it's two times slept,</v>

507
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>but I would say as an average because a lot of months I don't have a salary.</v>

508
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

517
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 2>that was the 10th the judge's ruling jail for 10 days.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been in jail for six months.</v>

591
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 2>How was I supposed to earn any money?</v>

592
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:12.251

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

642
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

643
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't fuck me for 11 years.</v>

644
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Tell called crazy ass laws.</v>

645
00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 2>And then when you tell them that you don't make that much money anymore,</v>

646
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 2>what do they say to the judge pat who made this ruling because they were,</v>

647
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I asked you for this six months.</v>

648
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.033
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

649
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And the judge kept saying to the fro attorney,</v>

650
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

651
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>give me another option because I'm looking at,</v>

653
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at the,</v>

654
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

655
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 2>the financial documents and I'm seeing where all the money,</v>

656
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 2>all the money that has come in and I'm seeing where it's all gone.</v>

657
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 2>It's all here in this documents,</v>

658
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 2>all the money that's come in and where it's all gone.</v>

659
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I can see it all in these documents.</v>

660
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.340
<v Speaker 2>So I am convinced that there isn't a half a million dollars from Mr. Foley to</v>

661
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 2>come up with today.</v>

662
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>So if you insist on that ruling,</v>

663
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 2>then I would send them to jail and your client will never see another dime</v>

664
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 2>because Mister Foley's career will be over.</v>

665
00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

666
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.501
<v Speaker 2>And he kept saying,</v>

667
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:05.501
<v Speaker 2>give me an option that will get your client some money and the Fr or refused.</v>

668
00:16:06.461 --> 00:16:06.681
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

669
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:06.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

670
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the authority from our client,</v>

671
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 2>my ex wife,</v>

672
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 2>to make any other offer.</v>

673
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

674
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 2>so for about two hours,</v>

675
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 2>the judge kept asking them to come up with another.</v>

676
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.320
<v Speaker 2>So all this time while you're sitting there,</v>

677
00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:19.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>

678
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jail.</v>

679
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 2>And I might be going to jail essentially forever.</v>

681
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

684
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Going to jail for being for the crime of not earning $1 million.</v>

685
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

686
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.130
<v Speaker 2>So what happens if that actually does happen?</v>

687
00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

688
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.360
<v Speaker 2>we have guys gone in jail with a large sum like that and never come out.</v>

689
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

690
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 2>But people have definitely gone to jail and,</v>

691
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 2>and definitely there's a lot of people who have been looking at jail time who</v>

692
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.710
<v Speaker 2>have just killed themselves.</v>

693
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

694
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.570

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't marry worse than I have because they'd probably be a lot better.</v>

737
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

738
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:43.961
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

739
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:45.280
<v Speaker 2>They're just an ambitious man.</v>

740
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

741
00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So what's the solution?</v>

742
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>So you cannot to Canada and you</v>

743
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>just send whatever you have and then you have to constantly deal with legal</v>

744
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>payments because they're constantly trying to fuck you.</v>

745
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And she spent like year and a half</v>

746
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 2>literally going to court every single month with lawyers.</v>

747
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Just basically having to go to court every month,</v>

748
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

749
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 2>just stay out of jail to go and have them put it over till the next month.</v>

750
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.283
<v Speaker 2>And the lawyers,</v>

751
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.273
<v Speaker 2>the lawyers,</v>

752
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people that do family law,</v>

754
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are really horrible people and they just make money off misery.</v>

755
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And even my own words,</v>

756
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>we're just extending this as far as they could until I ran out of money and</v>

757
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:22.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

758
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>and then quit.</v>

759
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So when I went to court for this ruling,</v>

760
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have,</v>

761
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a lawyer that couldn't afford one.</v>

762
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So you went by yourself,</v>

763
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 2>was there by myself.</v>

764
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Not only was that there by myself,</v>

765
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>but all of the documents that had been piled up,</v>

766
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>all of the evidence that had been piled up over the course of a year and a half</v>

767
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 2>was sitting in my lawyer's office.</v>

768
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

769
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.981
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

770
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 2>So you had no evidence and no lawyer.</v>

771
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

772
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Did you have records?</v>

773
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:46.314
<v Speaker 2>Did you have anything?</v>

774
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

775
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.461
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing.</v>

776
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

777
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So you're just going from there.</v>

778
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

779
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.261
<v Speaker 2>I have no money.</v>

780
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

781
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 2>this is all I can do.</v>

782
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And they're asking me questions about files that have been piling up over a year</v>

784
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

785
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.833
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

786
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

787
00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall.</v>

788
00:18:59.341 --> 00:18:59.641
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

789
00:18:59.641 --> 00:18:59.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't,</v>

791
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>how do they justify such an exorbitant amount of money?</v>

793
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

794
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 2>because it's the,</v>

795
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

796
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 2>as it was explained to me by my lawyers was that the courts,</v>

797
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

798
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 2>assumption is that the children should continue to live at the level they were</v>

799
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

800
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 2>at the time of the dissolution of the marriage.</v>

801
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

802
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.200
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy because if I were still married and my income dropped,</v>

803
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 2>their lifestyle would change.</v>

804
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

805
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 2>But because we're not married anymore,</v>

806
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 2>their lifestyle should never change no matter what I'm earning.</v>

807
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.501
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

808
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:28.921
<v Speaker 2>The judge,</v>

809
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:32.560
<v Speaker 2>the ruling that was enforced was by another judge named judge justice back</v>

810
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:33.394
<v Speaker 2>backhouse.</v>

811
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And she's the one who ruled about three,</v>

812
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 2>four years ago when I went back to try and get it adjusted,</v>

813
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:39.181
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

814
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:40.014
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

815
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.771
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

816
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

817
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 2>have to have a hearing to have it adjusted to meet my income.</v>

818
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

819
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and she ruled against me and in her ruling she said my ability to pay was not</v>

820
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 2>relevant to my obligation.</v>

821
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't matter to her what I proved my income to be if my income was zero,</v>

822
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 2>she said I was still obligated to pay as though I was earning $1 million.</v>

823
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people were saying,</v>

824
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:03.741
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan this day,</v>

825
00:20:03.741 --> 00:20:05.330
<v Speaker 1>fully guys bombing me the fuck out.</v>

826
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.513
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

827
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.401
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

828
00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:08.540
<v Speaker 1>this is some important shit.</v>

829
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.550
<v Speaker 1>This was my education in,</v>

830
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>in relationships and the law regarding relationships as I was growing up.</v>

831
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:15.500
<v Speaker 1>But literally,</v>

832
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:15.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

833
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:18.890
<v Speaker 1>when I was on news radio was a fresh face boy didn't know Jack Shit about the</v>

834
00:20:18.891 --> 00:20:19.430
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

835
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And this is how I learned about relationships and just how I learned about all</v>

836
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.290
<v Speaker 1>the whole gamut from divorce to fucking murder suicide.</v>

837
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And I learned it all.</v>

838
00:20:28.191 --> 00:20:29.240
<v Speaker 1>You are happily married.</v>

839
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.570
