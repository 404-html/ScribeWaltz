This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by Ting Tang

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:12.630
has a a new thing going on right now as we speak.

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:17.310
There's a new contest going on where they're giving away an iPhone five to one

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.920
lucky Joe Rogan podcast listener.

how much you'd save two at Joe Rogan with the Hashtag Ting.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.140
That's like the little pound sign.

11
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:34.974
It used to be pound,

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
pound Tang and the winner will be announced Friday,

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.350
April 4th u s residents only.

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.880
Very ironic for those who live in Canada cause although ting is an awesome cell

15
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.714
phone company,

16
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.160
it doesn't work in Canada.

17
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.030
It works in Canada,

18
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.980
but he can't like live in Canada and buy it.

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.300
I don't know why.

20
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.500
I don't understand anything.

21
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.350
What his tank tank is a no bullshit cell phone service.

22
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.230
What they have is a sprint backbone.

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.221
They use sprint,

24
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.600
they rent time on the sprint network,

25
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.510
but they do it all their way with no contracts,

26
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.280
no early termination fees,

27
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.060
no a bundling or ride along services.

28
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.980
The rates are what?

29
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.050
The way it works is you pay for what you use.

30
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:13.831
If you use more,

31
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.551
you pay more.

32
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.450
If you use less,

33
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.284
you pay less.

34
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.350
98% of people who would use Tang would save money.

35
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.520
That's straight from their website.

36
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.960
So it must be true.

37
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.510
I've done no research of my own to verify this,

38
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.490
but I have friends that use it.

39
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.570
Chris Ryan uses it,

40
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.730
he loves it.

41
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.920
Uh,

42
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.980
I know several people that I've met from doing the podcast.

43
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.300
Then use Tang,

44
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.090
love the service and love the fact they save a shitload of money.

45
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360
Go to rogan.ting.com and you can save 25 bucks off of your first ting device.

46
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.540
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com that's o.

47
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.220
N N.

48
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.220
I.

49
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.220
T.

50
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.380
Lots of new shit going on with on it.

51
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.050
I have a secret but I can't tell you.

52
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.820
We've got a lot of shit happening.

53
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170
But what on it is is a human optimization website,

54
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.320
but we sell is essentially all the different things that I use as far as like

55
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.990
strength and conditioning equipment like kettle bells or or a club bells or

56
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.860
battle ropes,

57
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.770
all things for developing functional strength.

58
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.340
All the different supplements that we've found that we find beneficial,

59
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.810
whether it's Alpha brain,

60
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.290
which is a competent Tory nootropic or shroom tech sport,

61
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.260
which is a an endurance supplement based on the court accepts mushroom.

62
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.930
All the different supplements have science behind them.

63
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.560
If you go to [inaudible] dot com you can read all the references.

64
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.430
There's been a clinical test recently that we just did on Alpha brain.

65
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.160
The double blind placebo test showed positive results.

66
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.850
The,

67
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.820
although the lab results are available,

68
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.740
but on a.com and there's more tests ongoing right now.

69
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:44.970
One for t plus.

70
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:47.520
We've got another Alpha brain going on one right now.

71
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.540
Um,

72
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.820
these are controversial supplements cause a lot of people think,

73
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.720
well wait a minute,

74
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.270
brain supplements of food for your brain,

75
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.770
it actually makes you smarter.

76
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.610
Get the fuck out of here.

77
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.480
It's like a big deck pill.

78
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.201
Well,

79
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.590
it's not the,

80
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.041
the,

81
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.550
the science behind it has been around for a long time and all the references and

82
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.050
all the information and data behind it.

83
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:10.051
Is that on at.com we also offer a 100% money back guarantee for 90 days.

84
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.440
And the first 30 pills,

85
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.101
you buy a bottle,

86
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.581
try it.

87
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.720
You don't even have to bring it back.

88
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.790
You don't have to send it in.

89
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.720
You just say it sucked and you get your money back.

90
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.390
The reason why we do that is because first of all,

91
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.190
we don't want anybody to feel ripped off.

92
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.300
These are controversial supplements in the beginning,

93
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.143
in the first place,

94
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.881
and two,

95
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.740
because we believe in it.

96
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.090
It's all shit that I use.

97
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.580
I used it long before I started working with on it.

98
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.580
Um,

99
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.570
I've been a fan of nootropics for a long time now.

100
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.620
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com O.

104
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.201
All right,

105
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:41.530
that's it.

106
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.221
Let's keep it brief.

107
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.650
I haven't curls here running out of time.

108
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.623
<v 1>Kick.</v>

109
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.470
Cute,

110
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.741
cute.

111
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.220
Jamie,

112
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.521
do it.

113
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:48.150
Jamie.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.823
Experience.

116
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.310
<v 2>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

117
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.370
Adam Carolla,

118
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.820
I saw you looking for some causes,

119
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.180
coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oil mixed in to,

120
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.343
do you know what that is?

121
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.190
Well,

122
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.300
the idea behind it,

123
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.930
it was a apparently invented two

124
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.400
<v 1>by a guy named Rob Wolf and then made popular by another guy named Dave Asprey</v>

125
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.850
and what it is is the grass fed butter in the MCT oil provide healthy fats mixed

126
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.470
in with the coffee and a,

127
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.200
it allows a slow burn of the caffeine,

128
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.060
so instead of that big crash that you get,

129
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.270
you don't get the big crash because your body has to absorb the fats that are

130
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.710
blended in with the caffeine.

131
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.130
Yeah,

132
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.010
it's very nice.

133
00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:34.600
It's sweet.

134
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.770
Very nice.

135
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.400
Yeah,

136
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.641
no.

137
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:41.560
What I do is I simply eat cows that had been fed coffee grounds.

138
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.050
That's a way to do it around them.

139
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.240
Go outside like a Cappuccino,

140
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.380
porterhouse or whatever.

141
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.270
Like instead of the grass fed beef,

142
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.420
I just feed him just straight Sumatra beans straight from a whole foods or

143
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.280
trader Joe's and then I'll eat that cow.

144
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.410
I would go to that steak joint by the way,

145
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.303
the coffee,

146
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.661
just coffee,

147
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.494
fat cow,

148
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.680
bunch of cows all jittery sitting around scratching at their utters and uh,

149
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.320
you know,

150
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.360
scratch scraping themselves up against the fence.

151
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.890
But I would definitely eat that.

152
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.230
That cow sounds like a great idea actually.

153
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.180
I wonder if it would have some sort of effect on the meat.

154
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.171
I don't know,

155
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.030
but I wonder does I'm in man,

156
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.931
I'm into,

157
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.531
let's open it.

158
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:21.311
Let's do it together.

159
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:22.870
It's the joint podcast business.

160
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.733
Yeah.

161
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.840
I want to also,

162
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.360
I want to tell me if you're down with this.

163
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.223
Okay.

164
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.410
The best part of going out and eating Italian food is where it's when the chick

165
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.770
comes by with that little silver bucket that has to Parmesan cheese in it,

166
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.300
and she does it with you,

167
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:43.600
like a little Parmer Shon on that pasta and you go,

168
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:44.201
fuck yeah,

169
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.900
I'd like a little Parmesan on that pasta.

170
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:49.000
And she takes the spoon out and she kind of flicks it around the top.

171
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.460
You never quite have the balls to go,

172
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:51.911
sweetie,

173
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:53.020
I need a second tip.

174
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.490
Like,

175
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.550
it's that good.

176
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:54.941
And you go,

177
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:55.241
yeah,

178
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.810
that's good.

179
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.070
I realize half the time people say you're good.

180
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.731
<v 3>I'm not good,</v>

181
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.200
but I just say I'm good anyway.

182
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.420
And then she walks away and then you eat the spaghetti but you eat the top,

183
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.840
you take the Parmer Shawn off the top and you get at some point you get down to

184
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:12.290
the middle and now your permit less.

185
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.540
I would open a restaurant where that bitch came back a second time and it's just

186
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.040
called more Parmer Shon,

187
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.380
it's mediocre Italian food,

188
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.670
but here's the rub.

189
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.650
The chick comes back a second time.

190
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:24.951
It goes,

191
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.980
can I top off some of that shit that I didn't hit the first

192
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.490
<v 1>time around?</v>

193
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.340
Your point of diminishing return with cheese,

194
00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.530
like the gets to be a point where you don't want half cheese,

195
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:33.221
half pasta.

196
00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:34.050
That would be a wreck.

197
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.740
<v 3>No,</v>

198
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.300
but the ratio is too great with the cheese at the beginning and then your cheese

199
00:06:39.301 --> 00:06:42.000
less in the middle to the end.

200
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.430
I just want that last dusting,

201
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.743
just that crop

202
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.310
<v 1>dust life.</v>

203
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.700
It's more exciting and fascinating in the beginning and the end.

204
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:51.840
You just sort of maintaining,

205
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.890
yeah.

206
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.940
Are you in maintenance mode?

207
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.610
No,

208
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.270
I'm fine.

209
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.103
Okay,

210
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.880
good.

211
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.713
Good.

212
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.890
I like your digs.

213
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.130
I,

214
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.690
last time I came to your place,

215
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:03.480
I was at your place and now I'm at your new place.

216
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.701
Yeah,

217
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.680
we got tired of bringing Weirdos over my house after awhile.

218
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.310
<v 3>No,</v>

219
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.491
I,

220
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:08.324
I,

221
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.820
I had that with a,

222
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:14.821
I had Andy Dick come over to my house and devour all of my lunch meats and like

223
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.590
thinly sliced provolone cheese.

224
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.110
You know the stuff you get from the Italian Deli that comes wrapped up in the,

225
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.980
in the paper and the white paper stuff.

226
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.750
Yeah.

227
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.590
And there's a weird thing,

228
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.750
and I don't know how you feel about this,

229
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.500
but I grew up poor and hungry.

230
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.530
Like I was fucking hungry all the time and food was a big deal and I had to Mooc

231
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:42.430
a lot of food off of other people.

232
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:46.960
Go to other people's houses and mooch their food at lunch was always bombing,

233
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.291
you know,

234
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:47.441
hey,

235
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:48.550
you're going to finish that sandwich,

236
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:49.371
got eat that sandwich.

237
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:49.540
You know,

238
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.530
it's like I'll always mooching and bumming Henry's Tacos over here in north

239
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:54.700
Hollywood when I was a kid.

240
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.430
I should go there and get the broken taco shells.

241
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:58.860
I'd go,

242
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.250
they make hard shell Tacos,

243
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:00.520
right?

244
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.791
Yeah.

245
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:02.230
You got brandy broken shells.

246
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.010
They'd go,

247
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.281
yeah.

248
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:04.180
Some of them break.

249
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:05.740
I go give me the broken shells.

250
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.000
They give me the broken shells.

251
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.350
I go give me some hot sauce.

252
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:08.770
I go,

253
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.670
here's some hot sauce.

254
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:10.260
It's free.

255
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.530
I got kind of a cup of water,

256
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.130
a cup of water,

257
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.000
not just sitting there eating my own fucking Nachos free.

258
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.991
It sucked.

259
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:17.711
At the time though,

260
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:18.101
it was like,

261
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:18.281
all right,

262
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:19.210
I'm getting free food.

263
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.050
Uh,

264
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:25.050
I was always crazy with food and if somebody ever gets into my shit,

265
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.190
I'm okay with it.

266
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.020
But there was some about the lunch meat.

267
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.820
Andy Dick came over and he's like,

268
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.841
you got any cheese,

269
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:32.531
you got any lunch meat?

270
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:33.850
And he stood in my kitchen.

271
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.750
He was just taking big handfuls of it and just shoving it in his face.

272
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.650
And then later on when we did the podcast,

273
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:42.700
he lit up a cigar,

274
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:46.030
smoked half of it in my office and then kept the other half,

275
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.360
but he never retrieved it and it rolled behind my printer.

276
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:54.040
And then my house smelled like smoke the lunch meats and smoke cigars and Andy

277
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.260
Dick for the next week.

278
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.094
And I was like,

279
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.690
it's time to move it to the studio.

280
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:58.350
It's time to go.

281
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.430
It's time to go to the warehouse.

282
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.540
How long ago was this?

283
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.270
I probably,

284
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.290
it's so weird because at the time you don't think to like write anything down.

285
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:12.291
But I probably started from my Dan in my house and I probably lasted about three

286
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.330
or four months and then I moved it to my

287
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:16.890
<v 1>warehouse.</v>

288
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.230
And what year did you start podcasts?

289
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.341
He,

290
00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:20.730
you started right when the radio show was done?

291
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.470
Yeah.

292
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.590
And a February.

293
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:23.101
Oh nine.

294
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.010
Isn't it funny that that was probably the best thing that could've ever happened

295
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:26.550
to you?

296
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.000
Is the radio show being done cause that radio show being done,

297
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.400
let you just completely be,

298
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.970
you not worry about nothing,

299
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.410
talk,

300
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.700
say whatever the fuck you want.

301
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.630
And your podcasts became the biggest podcast in the world directly.

302
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.680
As a result of that,

303
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.700
you went right from one right into the other and it became better.

304
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.291
<v 3>Well,</v>

305
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:46.130
you know,

306
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:46.964
uh,

307
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.010
we'd like to get philosophical,

308
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.830
which is what I always take about doing your show.

309
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.250
And everyone spends their life fearful and trying to avoid change and they look

310
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:01.101
at,

311
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.480
change is a,

312
00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.250
is a negative all the time.

313
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:04.401
Like,

314
00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:05.660
I want to keep my job,

315
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.770
I want to keep my house,

316
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.090
I want to keep my car,

317
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.460
I wanna,

318
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.530
I wanna keep my wife,

319
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.393
I want to keep,

320
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.671
you know,

321
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:13.610
unless you start making some real cash and then it's time for change.

322
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:14.730
But what I'm saying is,

323
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.830
you want to,

324
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.460
you should,

325
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.750
we spend our whole lives sort of hanging on to whatever we're hanging on to.

326
00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:23.600
Our youth are whatever,

327
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.400
it's don't change.

328
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:30.110
And then when somebody gets fired or somebody gets,

329
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.441
you know,

330
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:31.274
for me,

331
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.200
I tried to be a Groundling and,

332
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.550
and after a certain point,

333
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:35.390
the Groundling said,

334
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.270
you're not going to make it and you're gone.

335
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.600
And I was heartbroken and devastated.

336
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:44.330
And I've had girlfriends dumped me and I was heartbroken.

337
00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:44.721
I was Devin,

338
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:46.070
I had been fired from jobs.

339
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.121
Oh my God.

340
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:51.230
I had a terrestrial radio GIG and it paid tons of cash and had a big contract

341
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.100
and now you're done.

342
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.520
So you spend your entire life basically fearful and trying to avoid change.

343
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.910
But my question to you is,

344
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.430
when has changed ever been bad?

345
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.740
When is it ever slowed you down?

346
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.581
Is it,

347
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:12.200
doesn't it just open up other opportunities and can't you look back on your life

348
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:17.201
at a million times that things have changed and then almost immediately we're

349
00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:19.340
were better after that change.

350
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.731
Sure.

351
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.710
Your girlfriend dumps you and you're bummed out,

352
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.761
beaten off,

353
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.830
and he put tears for six weeks or months and then you meet a hotter chick or

354
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.700
different chick or smarter chick.

355
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.481
You know what I'm saying?

356
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.380
Same with the job.

357
00:11:30.381 --> 00:11:32.270
Same your entire journey of life.

358
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.800
What is no change?

359
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.310
No change is working at the same postal sorting place and Illinois for 41 years.

360
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.750
That's no change.

361
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.780
So even though we're always freaked out by change,

362
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.610
it's usually a good thing.

363
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:49.100
And it's basically life for them.

364
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.100
Are

365
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.580
<v 1>the people with the right attitude who do the right things right after a change?</v>

366
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:53.260
Definitely.

367
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.100
But some people

368
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.180
<v 0>allow to change to beat the fuck out of them and they never recover.</v>

369
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.420
There's people that got dumped in high school and were never the same human

370
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.320
being afterwards.

371
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.980
There's just people that just never recovered from getting fired from the first

372
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.310
good job they had and then got a pill addiction or whatever the fuck.

373
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.030
There's people that got one divorce and they lost all their money and they

374
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:14.350
decided to start shrinking.

375
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.741
It is,

376
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:15.574
fuck this,

377
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.560
<v 3>I'll throw it all away now.</v>

378
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:16.870
No,

379
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.870
and I agree and those people need to change and those people,

380
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:28.240
I mean you ever talked to those dudes that are hanging on to some shit from 20

381
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.074
years ago?

382
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.010
<v 0>I can't talk to someone who's hanging out with some shift from two weeks ago.</v>

383
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.520
<v 3>I cut it out.</v>

384
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.770
You know doctor drew,

385
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.570
when he first started doing love line a million years ago,

386
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.210
he worked with a dude called the poor man.

387
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.800
I remember that guy and poor man got himself fired.

388
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.330
I don't know all the ins and outs,

389
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:54.331
but he sent a bunch of listeners over to being of Kevin and beans house Gay Miss

390
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:56.650
Address that came out to his lawn.

391
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.000
He Ascot.

392
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.241
Well,

393
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.620
he did a few things that,

394
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.341
you know,

395
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:03.910
the management wasn't happy when the enemy's him and being or was it just for a

396
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:04.390
goof?

397
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.860
I think uh,

398
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.250
being with scrolling with poor man and poor man risk grown with being,

399
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:11.080
but it's like you,

400
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.190
it's like I was tickling you and you are tickling me and then I walked away and

401
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:21.220
you took a snow shovel and hit me over the head with it and whatever it is,

402
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.220
he crossed the line and it,

403
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.160
at some point the management just went,

404
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.601
well,

405
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:32.230
we're making a change and a poor man,

406
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:37.231
you're out and Ricky Rachman you're in and okay.

407
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.290
Ricky Rachman took over and it was doctor drew and Ricky Rachman and poor man

408
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.330
always want a doctor drew to hold out or quit with him or her or whatever he

409
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:50.230
wanted him to do.

410
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.000
I don't even know all the details.

411
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:52.391
Now.

412
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:57.391
Three years later I showed up and I took over for Ricky Rachman.

413
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.943
Uh,

414
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.160
six months ago I was doing one of my,

415
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.290
like Mangria tasting events,

416
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.340
um,

417
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.340
in Manhattan and somebody who was affiliated with the poor man was dispatched to

418
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.750
come to the event and sort of cornered me and hold a microphone in front of me

419
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:17.584
and say like,

420
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.980
what do you think of the poor man and what do you think a doctor drew and all

421
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:21.460
that.

422
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.310
And I started thinking to myself,

423
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.470
Jesus fucking Christ,

424
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:28.630
it's been 20 years.

425
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.730
And when I say 20 years,

426
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.160
I mean 22 years,

427
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.743
I thought,

428
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.831
let it go,

429
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:36.664
man.

430
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.070
Move onto whatever you're moving on to.

431
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.490
I don't know if you got screwed or you didn't get screwed.

432
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:45.640
We all get screwed at some point or another.

433
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:46.930
Move it on.

434
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.760
And I think she said,

435
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.040
is there anything you'd like to,

436
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.063
to poor man?

437
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
And by the way,

438
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.920
all I did was fill in,

439
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.890
all I did was take over for the guy who took over for him.

440
00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:00.050
I don't even have any association with him.

441
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.183
And I just said,

442
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.240
may the next 20 years be as fruitful as the last.

443
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.290
<v 1>Always a good thing to say someone but in context,</v>

444
00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:12.020
yes.

445
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.801
<v 3>Context.</v>

446
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:16.520
So I guess some people move on better than others,

447
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:17.354
but uh,

448
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.961
people,

449
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:22.430
if you're staring in your rear view mirror and you never stop looking at that

450
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:27.110
thing and all you want is for that thing to make you whole again,

451
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.650
you just keep driving and get getting further away.

452
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.330
The years just keep wearing on and that thing you're staring on staring at,

453
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.710
I think he's moved on.

454
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.401
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

455
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:40.190
patterns of thoughts can be a really good,

456
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.130
if you just one of those guys that develops a really good pattern of thought,

457
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:44.030
dust yourself off.

458
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:44.421
All right,

459
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.900
you can fucking keep moving by default and we're going to fucking use this.

460
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.290
It's going to be fuel and from here on how things are going to be way better

461
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:53.060
because there's no losses.

462
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:54.830
There's only lessons learned.

463
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:58.010
Our lesson we're moving on and then there's the other person that by default

464
00:15:58.011 --> 00:15:59.420
fuckin always happens to me.

465
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:01.190
Man always happens to me,

466
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.551
right?

467
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:03.110
So tired of the full the world.

468
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:03.980
Fuck me over.

469
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.510
She leaves me and Roy,

470
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.760
my fucking boss.

471
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.960
Fuck now all the same nonsense.

472
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.730
<v 3>Love the,</v>

473
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.051
I love the,

474
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:12.770
why'd you get it

475
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.340
<v 1>fired?</v>

476
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.600
I got fired because I do the work of five dudes and the boss felt threatened.

477
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:18.800
Yeah.

478
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.633
Has that ever happened?

479
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.340
No.

480
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.890
No.

481
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.280
I,

482
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.000
I've been the boss a lot of times.

483
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.100
I fired the guy should do the work of half a dude,

484
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:26.480
not find a nice guy.

485
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.380
You're a nice guy.

486
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.950
There are some people that don't like you doing better than them.

487
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:32.030
If they're in a position of power,

488
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:33.020
they will fuck you over

489
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.900
<v 3>there are always,</v>

490
00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:35.320
you know,

491
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:35.680
I try,

492
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.680
I say there are always people who are out there to fuck you over.

493
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:43.180
Just like there,

494
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.000
your chances,

495
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.863
there's a,

496
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.110
there's a chance that you can be hit by a drunk driver when you're just sitting

497
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:54.400
in an intersection,

498
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.420
you know,

499
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.800
minding your own business.

500
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.180
Just this guy is,

501
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.410
you know,

502
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.071
0.2,

503
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:04.810
seven five blows through a red lights completely blocked out and just puts you

504
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:06.580
in a wheelchair or a casket.

505
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:06.881
I mean,

506
00:17:06.881 --> 00:17:10.210
there is that opportunity that's out there for everyone.

507
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.980
And then there's the chance that you win the lottery.

508
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.690
Or Your Dad is Jerry Jones and owns a professional sports franchise,

509
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:20.590
and when he dies,

510
00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:22.540
he's going to give the Dallas cowboys to you.

511
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.900
That's not going to be anybody we know.

512
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:27.700
There'll be the high,

513
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.750
there'll be the low,

514
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.440
almost everyone we know we'll live in the middle and the middle is you get the

515
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.550
Dickhead boss that has it out for you.

516
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.100
You get the girlfriend that dumps you,

517
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.510
cheated on you,

518
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:45.750
and then you have the best friend who did Jia solid and the boss who was a

519
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:49.270
really cool guy and the landlord that was cool.

520
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.970
The landlord that is a deck,

521
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.130
you're just going to live in the middle.

522
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.113
So when you,

523
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.290
when you're in the middle and once you've decided you're not blessed,

524
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.460
you're not cursed,

525
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.990
you're just in the middle.

526
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.810
Now you get to control your own own destiny.

527
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.170
<v 1>I firmly believe that without all those fuck ups,</v>

528
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.850
the honey isn't this sweet.

529
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.730
You have to,

530
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.730
you have to get dumped if you don't get dumped.

531
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.690
If I was still with the same girl that I didn't want to get dumped by when I was

532
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:20.310
17 my life would be horrifying to be a horrible disaster.

533
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.180
She was,

534
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:21.990
you know,

535
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.400
we were not compatible.

536
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.810
Right.

537
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.520
Who were you compatible with?

538
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:31.521
It's that exactly who is compatible with anybody at 17 I wasn't at you think

539
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:34.050
about it like you hear about these people.

540
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:34.351
Wow.

541
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:36.630
You know we're 23 we're going to get married.

542
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.020
I think about where your fucking head was at at 23 Oh god,

543
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.273
no nowhere.

544
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.113
It was in the clouds.

545
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.253
I mean,

546
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.370
I don't even know that guys should be allowed to get married before 30 yeah,

547
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:50.920
I don't think you can think straight your,

548
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:51.311
your,

549
00:18:51.311 --> 00:18:52.080
your you,

550
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.100
you first off,

551
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:56.370
it's amazing that you're an adult and just how fucking stupid you are

552
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.580
<v 3>when you're 22 or 23 he said,</v>

553
00:18:58.581 --> 00:18:59.390
dude.

554
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.390
Also in terms of your understanding of a woman or giving her what she needs or

555
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:06.410
responsibility or responsibility,

556
00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:06.921
yourself,

557
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:07.580
family,

558
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.420
that kind of stuff.

559
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.340
No fucking wise.

560
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:10.931
<v 1>Bachelor.</v>

561
00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:13.820
If you don't have a close relationship to some women,

562
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.530
either women that are you're friends with,

563
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:20.060
he grew up with or preferably sisters or a close relationship with your mother.

564
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.370
You're a guy that grows up with his dad and mom's out of the picture and you're

565
00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:26.390
supposed to learn women.

566
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.890
Good fucking luck.

567
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.150
It's like shelling up in a school in Mexico and try to take first year Spanish.

568
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.520
Yeah,

569
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.300
everybody's fucking way ahead of you man.

570
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.350
They're way ahead of you.

571
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.310
They under like we don't understand each other until deep into our thirties as

572
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:44.750
far as like men and women kind of understanding it that this other person who

573
00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:45.450
is,

574
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.800
they have a completely different way of thinking.

575
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.250
This is a completely different wiring under the board and you press a button

576
00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:56.330
that you press on a guy and get a positive response and someone's mad at you and

577
00:19:56.331 --> 00:20:00.170
you have to kind of figure out what to say and what not to say and what to tease

578
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.690
about what you can't tease about ever.

579
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.950
I,

580
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.310
<v 3>when I,</v>

581
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.960
I didn't have a real close relationship with my family,

582
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.890
but when my,

583
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.100
when I was about 19 or 20 I was doing construction.

584
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.081
I was,

585
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:22.500
you know,

586
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.520
doing construction.

587
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:23.731
I mean,

588
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:27.500
I was picking up garbage on a construction site and digging ditches and you

589
00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:27.780
know,

590
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.360
basically just a glorified goop or you know,

591
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.140
like literally you,

592
00:20:32.141 --> 00:20:33.090
you think of it as,

593
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.481
oh,

594
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:37.230
you're constrained a bunch of guys wearing hard hats and putting together I

595
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:38.250
beams and girders.

596
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.260
Now it's just me walking around and picking up garbage,

597
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.980
you know,

598
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.860
that's kind of sweeping shit and stacking drywall.

599
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.753
You know,

600
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.070
I was probably making about seven,

601
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.380
$8 an hour and my dad said to me,

602
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.803
uh,

603
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.410
you're going to have trouble with women.

604
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.963
And I was like,

605
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.740
why?

606
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.573
And he's like,

607
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.241
ah,

608
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:03.241
I was married to your mom and you were raised by your mom and there's going to

609
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:04.840
be issues here.

610
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.160
And he shed a,

611
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.140
I'm going to find your shrink and I'll pay for half.

612
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.370
And you pay for half.

613
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.630
Now.

614
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.590
It is insane.

615
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:19.510
When you make $8 an hour and you're sitting down with someone who gets $100 an

616
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.190
hour for 50 minutes,

617
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.920
it's the most insane thing in the world.

618
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.580
It was literally like five hours of work for me to sit down with this woman in

619
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:34.150
Beverly Hills and discuss my problems when I was 20.

620
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.721
<v 0>And what,</v>

621
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:38.120
what kind of problems that you have that were so unusual that you had to sit

622
00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:38.954
down with a shrink?

623
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:45.410
<v 3>My Dad who comes from that kind of world basically said,</v>

624
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.430
you need to sit down with a woman and you need to establish a relationship with

625
00:21:53.371 --> 00:21:54.150
a woman.

626
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.890
That's a good relationship,

627
00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.340
basically saying it's not so much the information that you're going to get from

628
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:01.920
her,

629
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.250
but it's the relationship that you're going to have with her.

630
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.650
<v 0>So the fact that she's the position of authority and that she's intelligent and</v>

631
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:10.820
she's rational,

632
00:22:10.821 --> 00:22:15.500
and then you have to see her and you're sort of raise your bar on women because

633
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:16.334
of that.

634
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.001
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:18.110
Not so much,

636
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.363
um,

637
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.080
raising the bar,

638
00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:26.081
but just like you have never had a positive,

639
00:22:26.361 --> 00:22:31.220
consistent relationship with something that has a vagina.

640
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.150
Uh,

641
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.110
and I,

642
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.060
you need to have that.

643
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.541
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

644
00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:36.280
So he,

645
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.330
he basically saw trouble in your future?

646
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.200
<v 3>He did and he,</v>

647
00:22:40.201 --> 00:22:41.520
he knew that,

648
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:41.931
well,

649
00:22:41.931 --> 00:22:45.810
I didn't have that with my mom and I didn't really have that with my grandma and

650
00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:49.590
I wasn't really having that with anybody around me.

651
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.140
And that this needed to be established.

652
00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.320
<v 0>That's some deep insight by your dad.</v>

653
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.073
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

654
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.500
I,

655
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.370
it was kind of interest.

656
00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:57.611
I mean,

657
00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:59.440
it is kind of his bag,

658
00:22:59.441 --> 00:22:59.681
you know,

659
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:00.820
it's kind of his thing,

660
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.990
but it was,

661
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.861
and you know,

662
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:05.980
it's one of these things where it's like a Multivitamin,

663
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.671
you know,

664
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:08.370
he's to help people like therapies,

665
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.460
like a multivitamin.

666
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:09.790
They're like,

667
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.541
does it work?

668
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.380
Does it not work?

669
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:13.420
I go the field different.

670
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.080
I go,

671
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.651
I don't know.

672
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.820
When you take a Multivitamin,

673
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:20.470
do you feel different or are you just being active in your health,

674
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.500
into your participating in your health?

675
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.701
Do you know what I'm saying?

676
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:25.534
Yes.

677
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.530
And you know,

678
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.070
obviously when you take a quite Lou,

679
00:23:28.071 --> 00:23:29.020
do you feel different?

680
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.000
But when you take a Multivitamin,

681
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.500
I don't know if you feel different.

682
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.390
It's part of,

683
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.110
but you should take that multivitamin.

684
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.280
That's what I'm saying,

685
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.080
be active in it.

686
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.801
I always thought,

687
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:42.634
you know,

688
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.760
half of therapy is you physically getting up and going right to therapy and

689
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.730
participating in that aspect of your life.

690
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.571
<v 1>So the,</v>

691
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:55.730
the therapy wasn't like,

692
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.840
it's not something like,

693
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:57.740
Holy Shit Dude,

694
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:59.120
you need fucking therapy.

695
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.313
It was more like,

696
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.801
you know,

697
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:01.880
it's good to take a vitamin.

698
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.320
Yeah.

699
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:03.740
Yeah.

700
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.650
It's like if your dad was into holistic health and he said,

701
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.080
here's poor kid,

702
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:10.100
here are some herbs.

703
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.380
Tape bonkers drives me crazy.

704
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.350
The idea that some douche bag who's got a,

705
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:19.970
an ancient book on leaves knows more than some fucking dude who has spent his

706
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:22.490
entire life studying diseases.

707
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:22.920
Yeah.

708
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.520
They have like some really good modern cures,

709
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.630
but no shit had over here wants to give you some holistic cure then may or may

710
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.320
not work.

711
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.130
<v 3>Well,</v>

712
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.240
here's the whole thing about the holistic stuff for me and it's sort of the,

713
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:35.720
you know,

714
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.480
the wisdom of the Orient and all that kind of bullshit.

715
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.710
To me it's like this.

716
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.920
If you don't have a real problem then it'll cure whatever your non real problem

717
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:47.510
is.

718
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.510
If your real problem is just some sort of fatigue that's based on depression or

719
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:56.930
d or based on something that's going on emotionally in your life,

720
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.420
basically it's living in your head but you say,

721
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:04.430
oh my joints take and I have trouble getting out of bed and I give you a magic

722
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:09.431
pill that has a little bit of whisker of the cat and it then that will work on

723
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:10.460
you.

724
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.680
Now if you got a real problem,

725
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.830
I do a podcast with a guy named Brian.

726
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.130
Brian has a tumor on his brain stem and he's got a real problem that's a

727
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:28.961
different problem and he takes medication that stops the growth of that.

728
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.470
If that tumor it experimental at the time,

729
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.800
but if that tumor grows then he's dead within six months and he started years

730
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:40.844
old.

731
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.620
So when you have a tumor on the base of your spine or the top of your spine and

732
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:46.011
the base,

733
00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:46.551
your brain,

734
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:50.180
that's an opera ball whisker of the cat and the fucking hair,

735
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.014
the newt

736
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.790
is not going to fucking heel that shit

737
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.020
<v 1>for you rhino horn for right,</v>

738
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.220
right.

739
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:58.910
No,

740
00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.900
that doesn't work.

741
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.250
If you have a real problem,

742
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.470
that's the best combination.

743
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.420
Like the best comparison rather is Rhino Horn versus Cialis.

744
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.050
Right?

745
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:09.883
One of them,

746
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.730
you know,

747
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.770
only works in your mind and you're like,

748
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:13.110
Whoa,

749
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.690
I feel more viral.

750
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:19.580
And the other one gives you a steel rod and your pants for a solid day.

751
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.550
Right?

752
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.260
You have a choice whether you want to go with Voodoo or that little blue thing.

753
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.380
While the Rhino Horn should be a strap on Rhino Horn,

754
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.760
you should get the whole horn.

755
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.740
Forget about grinding it up and do a fucking powder and putting in your teach.

756
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.040
Give me the whole fucking horn.

757
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:34.671
I'll put,

758
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:34.880
uh,

759
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.500
I'll put a,

760
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:35.890
you know,

761
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.730
Bob bicycle inner tube around it.

762
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.050
Wrapper once around the Pauls and nail over the fucking horn.

763
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.010
Could you imagine how horrible it

764
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.320
<v 0>would be if men had hard on all the time,</v>

765
00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:46.980
like a horn.

766
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.580
It wasn't a biological process that you had to like engage in your head.

767
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.190
All factors have to be right and anything that's wrong,

768
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.293
fear,

769
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.680
boner shuts down,

770
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.310
drunk.

771
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.270
The boner shuts down,

772
00:26:57.271 --> 00:26:58.110
all these things happen.

773
00:26:58.111 --> 00:26:59.040
Your bonus shuts down.

774
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.140
The complex biological process.

775
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:01.974
That is the erection.

776
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.670
If we just had a rhino horn and we could just fuck all the time,

777
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.530
what a wreck it would be on earth.

778
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.150
Everyone would have callous dicks.

779
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.930
We'd have like caked calluses all around the outsides of our dicks.

780
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.020
All these places instead of Manny petty places.

781
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:19.380
The places that would remove the cows is so you could enjoy pleasure with you.

782
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.090
<v 3>Again,</v>

783
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:25.090
I'm going to step up your apocalyptic boner future nightmare scenario.

784
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.810
I'm going to fucking turn this one up to 11 then imagine if there were boner

785
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.983
poachers

786
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.061
and they're like,

787
00:27:35.061 --> 00:27:35.720
Hey,

788
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.250
some guy and uh,

789
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.810
Japan wants to make some soup at a Rogan's cock cause he thinks it's going to

790
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:43.220
make his cock harder.

791
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.790
Wow.

792
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.820
Rogan's at Veeroll guy sit into the MMA.

793
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.661
So the next thing you know,

794
00:27:47.661 --> 00:27:48.261
you've got to look,

795
00:27:48.261 --> 00:27:51.470
you're looking over your shoulder because there's some dude and you don't know

796
00:27:51.471 --> 00:27:54.950
if he's a game warden or she's on your side or their side,

797
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.950
but every time the sun goes down,

798
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.300
you've got to worry about the cock poachers.

799
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.800
<v 0>Could you imagine there is no way to grow your Dick,</v>

800
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.250
but could you imagine if the only way to grow your dig would be sucking dicks?

801
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.420
You'd have to run around and suck has many dicks as possible to get your Dick

802
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.930
Bigger.

803
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.310
But it did work.

804
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.181
So girl,

805
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:13.610
when you know you pull your pants up,

806
00:28:13.611 --> 00:28:16.170
she'd look at your deck and she would know for a fact,

807
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:16.471
wow,

808
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:17.251
that's a great deck.

809
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:20.910
But this guy most likely sucked a lot of Cox to get that Dick so big.

810
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.940
<v 3>Right?</v>

811
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.940
Well then you'd have to explain that that's just a sort of born this way.

812
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.960
God's gift.

813
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.210
Your Dad and Grandpa have huge Cox.

814
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.931
They never suck.

815
00:28:31.931 --> 00:28:32.440
Cock.

816
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.220
Maybe you wouldn't,

817
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.850
you wouldn't want to protest that much.

818
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.060
You don't have to lie about it a little bit.

819
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.990
I don't know.

820
00:28:37.991 --> 00:28:39.310
Body builders and steroids.

821
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.680
I don't know if the chick would assume that,

822
00:28:41.681 --> 00:28:46.681
but it would be an interesting thing to find out a survey of straight guys,

823
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.880
which is if you could grow your cock by sucking cock,

824
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.640
would you be in and down for that?

825
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.301
It would be like,

826
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:56.680
how much does it grow too?

827
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.281
Oh yeah.

828
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:57.820
There'd be like,

829
00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.241
you suck.

830
00:28:58.241 --> 00:28:58.991
Dick grew an inch.

831
00:28:58.991 --> 00:28:59.824
Holy Shit.

832
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.670
There'd be a long negotiation about swallowing,

833
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.970
about length,

834
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.000
about are we metric or standard.

835
00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:08.350
Here we go in millimeters.

836
00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:09.400
We going by the inch.

837
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.473
How do we do it?

838
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.640
I always say this and it was,

839
00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:14.170
everyone talks about you know your Dick,

840
00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:14.971
your Dick size,

841
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:16.720
you measure the Dick had he measured the Dick.

842
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.363
I say this,

843
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.260
it should be standardized.

844
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.940
You mentioned your cock this way.

845
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.560
You,

846
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.970
you heard it on Joe Rogan's show it once and for all.

847
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:25.700
Okay.

848
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.740
The official way to do it,

849
00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:28.090
use a cloth measuring tape,

850
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.640
center of the anus,

851
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.303
watts.

852
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.163
Hear me out.

853
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.710
Center of the anus once around the balls to just pass the tip.

854
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.400
Just pass the test that that's official way.

855
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.540
I measure my cock and I think it should be a standard that's um,

856
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.160
it's very generous of you.

857
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:49.811
That's your way.

858
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:50.411
You mess your car.

859
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:52.660
I've heard these supposed to measure from the bottom and I think that's

860
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:53.290
ridiculous.

861
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.870
Nobody knows central venous,

862
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.130
don't cheat it back.

863
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.290
Go Center once around the balls.

864
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:00.160
Just pass the tip.

865
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.510
Let me ask you another thing,

866
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:02.620
Joe Cocker related.

867
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:03.250
Okay.

868
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.720
Tell me if you'd be down with this.

869
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:05.770
I,

870
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.160
I've,

871
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.260
I've given this a lot,

872
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.790
a lot of thought,

873
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.840
a lot more thought than,

874
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.220
than,

875
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.590
than I'm really comfortable admitting.

876
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:19.591
But I had this idea where we do a water displacement test on every guy over 18

877
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.800
your hard cock into a graduated cylinder filled to the top with water through

878
00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:36.280
just a very thin sheet of like stainless steel,

879
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.400
lower you down and we literally see how much water's displaced by your two

880
00:30:41.401 --> 00:30:42.300
messant cock.

881
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.940
Hmm.

882
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.600
Okay.

883
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.170
Now this factors in girth and length and everything else.

884
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:50.080
This is so water should be a volume thing.

885
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:51.490
This is water displacement.

886
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.683
Okay.

887
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.940
Once we do that,

888
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.550
we do it for every male in America over the age of 18.

889
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.360
You then are issued a windbreaker that windbreaker has your ranking on it,

890
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.840
not how much water you displaced,

891
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.140
not how big your caucus but out of,

892
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.420
Oh let's say there's 100 million males that are over the age of 18 and the

893
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:20.374
United States,

894
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.720
what place you come in.

895
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.650
Number one,

896
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.700
that'd be a pretty fucking good windbreaker to have.

897
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.510
You'd also,

898
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:33.730
anybody was in the top 10 would be making the fucking rounds on the late night

899
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:36.010
shows and each year,

900
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.220
you know there's two,

901
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:39.551
three,

902
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:44.551
5 million guys turning 18 it all has to be recalibrated every year.

903
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.900
I mean you may see getting bigger if you saw a graph of how big dicks used to be

904
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:51.840
in the 20s and 2000 well it to,

905
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:52.240
you know,

906
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:52.830
just if,

907
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.021
if,

908
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:54.490
if people are getting bigger,

909
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.241
I'm sure.

910
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:56.620
Proportionately we are.

911
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:57.850
So the point is this,

912
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.920
you may be number one,

913
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.910
but there's always some guy turning 18 I mean there's a thousand guys just

914
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:05.740
turned 18 the time I said that.

915
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.390
And they're getting tested and there's a big reveal and for one month

916
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.510
everybody's got aware that windbreaker,

917
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.950
wherever they are.

918
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.540
And you know,

919
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.220
look,

920
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.970
if you're going to wear that thing for a month,

921
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:19.420
if you're,

922
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.410
that's the rule,

923
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.460
2 million,

924
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:25.400
999 billion and someone's,

925
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.380
it's starting at 100 million.

926
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:27.911
I mean,

927
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:30.490
you can be sure somebody is going to be last.

928
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.701
Well,

929
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:31.320
there's three,

930
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.410
150 million,

931
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.970
300 million people in the country,

932
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:36.640
so 150 million plus minus,

933
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.460
but then you've got to go 18 year old right after that,

934
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.360
but let's just call it 100 million people.

935
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.340
And for my money,

936
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.330
the number one dude is going to do all the late night shows.

937
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.560
And the last dude,

938
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.630
he's going to make the rounds to

939
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.510
<v 0>one guy that has the biggest cock in the world.</v>

940
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:55.160
Apparently he went to the Tsa,

941
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.730
uh,

942
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.160
like he was wearing sweatpants and they accused him of trying to smuggle

943
00:32:58.161 --> 00:32:58.580
something.

944
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.960
The guy's got a giant hog.

945
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.411
Yeah.

946
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:03.350
Apparently it was like all over these news reports.

947
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.000
I white guy too.

948
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:06.020
Pasty looking white guy.

949
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.401
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

950
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:10.000
I think his name is Jonah Falcon or something like that.

951
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.130
That's,

952
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:11.951
that's what I heard.

953
00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:12.300
I thought,

954
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.870
I think I saw a documentary right.

955
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.590
<v 0>Do you remember in the porn days?</v>

956
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:17.870
And it's not saying that John Holmes doesn't have a big Dick.

957
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.040
He definitely has a big Dick.

958
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:20.750
But you remember when we were kids,

959
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:21.830
we'd watch porn.

960
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.000
If you saw John Holmes,

961
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:23.301
you'd be like,

962
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:23.991
Holy Shit,

963
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:24.830
that's a big Dick.

964
00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.850
Show it on a falcon.

965
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.570
So sad frist by TSA by the way.

966
00:33:28.571 --> 00:33:29.090
Don't believe it.

967
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.770
Ask me who the vice president is.

968
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.280
I'm like,

969
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.113
AH,

970
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.663
state.

971
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.660
Ah Fuck Man.

972
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:37.250
I didn't know it's going to be a history quiz,

973
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.900
but big Cox,

974
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.760
I'm fucking your man.

975
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.920
John Holmes used to have a giant Dick.

976
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.410
But now that's like pretty standard.

977
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.290
Like there's a lot of those guys with big giant Dicks,

978
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.520
especially the black ones.

979
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.290
<v 3>I don't,</v>

980
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.880
well I got a theory about big giant black dicks.

981
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.743
Thank God.

982
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.300
Tails nicely into my windbreaker right there.

983
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.760
I got a theory about that.

984
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.560
Um,

985
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:01.850
and it,

986
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.890
and it is the following.

987
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.013
First off,

988
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.390
how dare you be.

989
00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:09.590
Smirch a good name of Johnny Wad home.

990
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.120
Cause he did have a big Dick still big by today's big Dick Standard.

991
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:16.953
No doubt.

992
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.823
But,

993
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.580
uh,

994
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.580
as far as black guys having big dicks in porn,

995
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.280
I think that's a form of porn racism.

996
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:28.660
Hmm.

997
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.530
And I'll tell you why.

998
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.400
I think if you show up onto a porn set is a black guy with a medium sized cock

999
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.830
fair to Midland.

1000
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:39.720
You know,

1001
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.030
man,

1002
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.500
I got six and a half inches here.

1003
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.670
They send you a packet.

1004
00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.391
They're like,

1005
00:34:43.391 --> 00:34:45.460
we don't need black guys with small Cox.

1006
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.440
We only need black guys with big Cox.

1007
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.890
We can take a white guy with a medium cock,

1008
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:52.480
but we can't take a black guy.

1009
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:53.081
Well,

1010
00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:56.410
why bother getting fucked by a black guy if the guy has got a medium cock?

1011
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.520
You see what I'm saying?

1012
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.050
I think they're discriminated against.

1013
00:34:59.051 --> 00:35:04.051
So I think we think the only huge cock we've seen is in porn.

1014
00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:04.930
It's on black guys.

1015
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.890
They won't let average size cocked black men in.

1016
00:35:08.891 --> 00:35:13.891
And I dream of a future where my children can watch pornography and see black

1017
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:17.620
guys with medium sized Cox,

1018
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:18.070
you know,

1019
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.330
balls deep in a junky coked up blondes here.

1020
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:22.930
Here.

1021
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:23.260
Yeah.

1022
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.581
That's,

1023
00:35:23.581 --> 00:35:24.920
that's offensive future for,

1024
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.833
yeah.

1025
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.471
<v 0>I remember,</v>

1026
00:35:26.471 --> 00:35:26.830
um,

1027
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.390
you were talking about Ricky Rachman earlier.

1028
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.250
Do you remember the con Wayne Steckler show?

1029
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.850
That was a great show,

1030
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:32.230
right?

1031
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.511
Yeah.

1032
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:33.460
I love John Wayne Stack,

1033
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:33.611
right?

1034
00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:33.820
Yeah.

1035
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.151
And,

1036
00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:34.570
uh,

1037
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.690
didn't Ricky Rachman Punch Steckler stuck in the old days?

1038
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.553
Oh,

1039
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 1>I think he did to stack used to like mock a show.</v>

1040
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.470
They would make fun of a show.

1041
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.790
<v 3>I think I did.</v>

1042
00:35:45.791 --> 00:35:46.211
Yes.

1043
00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:51.010
He had like the triple r Ricky Rachman radio or something like that.

1044
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.000
And there was a lot of that back in the day,

1045
00:35:55.001 --> 00:35:58.480
like way back in the day when a Kimball was,

1046
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.100
when we're doing mornings,

1047
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.931
not me and him,

1048
00:36:01.931 --> 00:36:02.890
but on Kevin and being,

1049
00:36:02.891 --> 00:36:04.510
and he was making fun of somebody,

1050
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.333
uh,

1051
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.450
this guy,

1052
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.200
this guy came into the studio and just started choking him.

1053
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.333
Whoa.

1054
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.660
I could literally just

1055
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.730
tried to throttle him for no reason.

1056
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:18.880
Just he heard him on the air.

1057
00:36:18.881 --> 00:36:19.714
Like,

1058
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.861
you know,

1059
00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:25.861
the thing about radio is it was real time and it was back in the day.

1060
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.680
And I've,

1061
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.940
I'd had situations where I've said,

1062
00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:31.570
you know,

1063
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:31.961
David,

1064
00:36:31.961 --> 00:36:33.250
our cats nuts,

1065
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.450
he's insane.

1066
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.051
I think he's,

1067
00:36:35.051 --> 00:36:38.020
he should be institutionalized and shit like that.

1068
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.220
And then like walked out of the studio during a commercial break and David

1069
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.140
Arquette is standing there going,

1070
00:36:44.141 --> 00:36:47.080
I was driving home from the Lakers game on the 10 freeway.

1071
00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:48.640
I was listening to love line.

1072
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.020
I heard you call me and saying,

1073
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.690
ah.

1074
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.180
Then when doctor drew said,

1075
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.940
aren't you worried he's going to come over here and punch you?

1076
00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:55.480
Uh,

1077
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.760
you laughed and said he's too nuts.

1078
00:36:57.761 --> 00:36:58.150
He doesn't,

1079
00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.650
he couldn't find this place and literally told us driver to pull over,

1080
00:37:02.651 --> 00:37:04.960
get off the freeway and drove right to us.

1081
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.550
It was literally standing there.

1082
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.420
Was He mad?

1083
00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.253
Was He laughing?

1084
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.060
He was both,

1085
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.190
which I've had a few times.

1086
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.290
It's just an insane thing.

1087
00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:16.840
It's like you pick a random celebrity,

1088
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.520
talk about how nutty you think they are and then 10 minutes later opened that

1089
00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:23.140
door and they're standing there.

1090
00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.510
Yeah.

1091
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.340
<v 1>Worried that I run into Stephen Dorff and I have to explain that I was only</v>

1092
00:37:27.341 --> 00:37:29.080
joking about his fucking commercial.

1093
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.750
Those.

1094
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.470
Yeah,

1095
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.220
those are Dorky commercials.

1096
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.761
But you know,

1097
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:36.760
the Dorky man or if they weren't your commercials you'd be mocking them to cut

1098
00:37:36.761 --> 00:37:37.230
the shit.

1099
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.063
<v 3>I,</v>

1100
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.570
I liked him and Blake,

1101
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.170
who's awesome,

1102
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.720
I've had a lesson,

1103
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:48.210
you know the idea that first off,

1104
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.530
I don't know how you are,

1105
00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:52.560
but people send me shit all the time.

1106
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:53.010
They're like,

1107
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.843
oh,

1108
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.670
checkout,

1109
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.020
uh,

1110
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.620
Andy kindler talking all kinds of shit about your calling you Hitler and this,

1111
00:37:58.621 --> 00:37:59.140
that and the other.

1112
00:37:59.140 --> 00:37:59.620
Like,

1113
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.330
here's a,

1114
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.140
here's a link,

1115
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.680
you know,

1116
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.371
listen to it.

1117
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:03.240
And I just go,

1118
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.700
why do I need to go to a link where someone is talking shit about me?

1119
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.100
Like I'm not interested in that.

1120
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.760
I most people have a morbid curiosity about it.

1121
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:20.390
I'm sure that there are plenty of people that call me an asshole or who think

1122
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:22.500
I'm an asshole or both.

1123
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.790
Like I don't,

1124
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.270
I'm not interested in stopping them from doing it or,

1125
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.250
or curing them of that,

1126
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.210
of that problem.

1127
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.150
I don't know how you feel like I don't,

1128
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.540
I don't seek anything about myself because I know with a ratio of 10 positive

1129
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:46.060
things to one shitty thing and if the one shitty thing is going to fuck your day

1130
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:46.750
up,

1131
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.650
don't bother.

1132
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:48.370
You know,

1133
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.090
doing,

1134
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.000
putting your name and the Google search and seeing what's coming up.

1135
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.480
But I assume people are saying shitty things about me all the time.

1136
00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.021
Well,

1137
00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:01.030
some most certainly world will,

1138
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.120
especially if you're out in the public eye and it's definitely a good idea.

1139
00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:08.320
I think I agree with you 100% don't go searching negative shit about yourself.

1140
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:08.861
It's just,

1141
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:09.670
it's not fun.

1142
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.390
It's not,

1143
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.010
but David Arquette was in his car,

1144
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:12.370
right?

1145
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.630
So he just heard you.

1146
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.471
It's kind of funny.

1147
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:16.180
When he did find is funny.

1148
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:16.451
Yeah,

1149
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:17.284
no he was,

1150
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.240
it was perfect because we,

1151
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.740
we were in Culver city and you have to sort of know the lay of the land out

1152
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:24.550
here.

1153
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.230
We were in Culver city.

1154
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.450
He had gone to a Lakers game,

1155
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.280
I guess it's a staple center.

1156
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.280
He was driving back to where Haman,

1157
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:36.040
Courtney Cox live in Malibu.

1158
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.260
He had a town car.

1159
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.430
Um,

1160
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:40.930
the Lakers game ended it,

1161
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.440
you know,

1162
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.440
10 o'clock and love lines started at 10 o'clock and he was in his town car at 10

1163
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:49.930
20 driving past.

1164
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:50.560
I mean,

1165
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.310
Culver City was a block away from the 10 freeway and he's drunk.

1166
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.970
He's listening to love line and he's telling us,

1167
00:39:57.971 --> 00:39:58.804
driver,

1168
00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.651
get off here,

1169
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:00.670
turn off right now.

1170
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:03.940
Turn off right now and turn left and I'll be at the studio.

1171
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:05.530
And there he was.

1172
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.640
That's hilarious.

1173
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.570
Yeah.

1174
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.680
So how did you guys end it?

1175
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.850
Did it get weird?

1176
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.840
No.

1177
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.010
So he laughed at it.

1178
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:13.510
At some point in time there was laughter.

1179
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.170
Yes.

1180
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:14.740
Yes.

1181
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.191
That's good.

1182
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:15.521
Yes.

1183
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:18.940
It did not end in a violent or got to know it comes off like a fucking nut.

1184
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.260
That's part of his shtick.

1185
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:20.620
Right?

1186
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.420
Isn't that a guy who,

1187
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:22.991
you know,

1188
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:26.980
like half of his thing is talking about how fucking crazy he's life is and he

1189
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:28.540
knows he comes off kind of crazy.

1190
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.220
I don't get,

1191
00:40:30.221 --> 00:40:30.731
I mean,

1192
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:33.400
I've had this happen a few times where I've like said,

1193
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:34.001
well,

1194
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:35.230
this person's nuts.

1195
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:35.830
And then it's like,

1196
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:36.071
Ooh,

1197
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:36.731
they're pissed off.

1198
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:39.970
You called him nuts and it's like it's Marilyn Manson.

1199
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.430
Like how do you think they're perceived?

1200
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.001
You know what I mean?

1201
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:47.170
Andy Dick got mad at me for talking about how crazy he was on the set of news

1202
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:47.960
radio.

1203
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.570
You know,

1204
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.391
he's heavy.

1205
00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:51.010
Your your debts you like,

1206
00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:53.350
that's what the whole thing that you've put out there,

1207
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.101
you put out the,

1208
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:54.934
you're crazy,

1209
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.691
right?

1210
00:40:55.691 --> 00:40:56.590
Hilarious guy.

1211
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.440
But he's clearly nuts and not only that,

1212
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:00.041
but there's,

1213
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:00.874
you know,

1214
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.540
files and files and files and you know,

1215
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:09.541
whatever municipality police department there is of you doing things that were

1216
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.560
clearly a behavior that would not be considered saying behavior.

1217
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.250
Right.

1218
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.200
We have a rich history of being nuts.

1219
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.600
Yeah.

1220
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.340
Yeah.

1221
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.360
Why not just own it,

1222
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.081
own it.

1223
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:21.790
But I think he's one of those guys,

1224
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:25.270
it's like constantly and a rebirthing process constantly.

1225
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:26.104
Like this is it.

1226
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.920
Every time I run into him it's like a,

1227
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.451
that's it.

1228
00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:29.284
I'm sober,

1229
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.610
I'm done now I'm done.

1230
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.473
I'm done.

1231
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.080
The last time I ran into him,

1232
00:41:33.081 --> 00:41:34.070
he was sober and

1233
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.050
<v 0>he said he couldn't promise you would stay sober.</v>

1234
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.280
Right.

1235
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:37.731
Wow.

1236
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:42.380
You should never be able to say that because if you can't convince yourself,

1237
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.800
right,

1238
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.090
it's never going to happen.

1239
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.140
<v 4>It's uh,</v>

1240
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.610
it's too bad too,

1241
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.640
because I always think of him as a very talented dude who just has so many inner

1242
00:41:53.661 --> 00:41:58.661
whatever's going on that he was never fully able to realize that talent because

1243
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:03.500
of all the other extraneous,

1244
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:06.980
external sort of things that are going on inside of him.

1245
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.210
On the other hand,

1246
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.711
you kind of go,

1247
00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:10.544
well,

1248
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.930
that is who he is.

1249
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:12.141
I mean,

1250
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:14.600
that is why we know of him,

1251
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.270
but you wonder and you think,

1252
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.200
you know,

1253
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.910
what does the future hold?

1254
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.980
You know what all that stuff is.

1255
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.221
It's,

1256
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:22.700
it's like,

1257
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.540
it's like a chick.

1258
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:23.900
It's like,

1259
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.900
it's great being drunk and crazy and stupid and hot and 25 but at a certain

1260
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:33.830
point you're going to turn 50 what is that like at that point?

1261
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.081
Well,

1263
00:42:35.081 --> 00:42:37.630
I think Andy was brilliant on news radio.

1264
00:42:37.631 --> 00:42:40.000
One of the reasons why is because he was more reigned in,

1265
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.331
you know,

1266
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:43.340
it was his first big Gig is NBC.

1267
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:44.080
He couldn't get,

1268
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.130
get too nutty.

1269
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.600
They were riding for him.

1270
00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:47.590
They're brilliant writers.

1271
00:42:47.591 --> 00:42:49.840
They knew how to craft something for him,

1272
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.660
but he's,

1273
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:50.890
yeah,

1274
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:51.131
yeah,

1275
00:42:51.131 --> 00:42:51.491
I agree.

1276
00:42:51.491 --> 00:42:52.720
He's a very talented guy.

1277
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.100
But one of the reasons why he's so funny is most likely in response to those

1278
00:42:57.101 --> 00:42:57.721
demons,

1279
00:42:57.721 --> 00:42:59.740
like there's sure there's,

1280
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:00.201
there's a,

1281
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:00.620
you know,

1282
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.820
there's a yin and a Yang to everything and there there's something that makes

1283
00:43:03.821 --> 00:43:05.470
him that way and whatever it is,

1284
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.300
he doesn't always have a good grip on it.

1285
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.620
<v 4>No,</v>

1286
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:09.730
but it'd be,

1287
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:15.190
it'd be nice cause he's a nice guy and he's a talented guy.

1288
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:15.990
<v 0>Yes.</v>

1289
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.920
He's definitely a nice guy.

1290
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.521
Talented guy.

1291
00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:18.390
He's just fucking crazy.

1292
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:18.830
Yeah.

1293
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.410
Okay.

1294
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:20.160
What are you going to do?

1295
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.240
We live in a crazy place.

1296
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.261
Last time I spoke to you,

1297
00:43:22.261 --> 00:43:23.400
you were thinking about getting out of here.

1298
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.440
We were talking about Seattle.

1299
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.220
Yeah.

1300
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.680
You were saying it's just too rainy cause you like cars.

1301
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:29.963
Yeah.

1302
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.800
If you given any thought to escaping from La,

1303
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:32.940
<v 4>I've,</v>

1304
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:33.773
uh,

1305
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.003
I've,

1306
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:35.881
you know,

1307
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:36.331
it's funny,

1308
00:43:36.331 --> 00:43:37.650
I travel so much.

1309
00:43:37.651 --> 00:43:41.070
I almost feel like I don't live here anyway.

1310
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.463
Um,

1311
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:47.780
it's tough because I'm so ensconced in this

1312
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:54.530
podcasting world and production world and working on all these various projects,

1313
00:43:55.951 --> 00:44:00.951
independent films and working on Paul Newman racing documentary and all that

1314
00:44:00.961 --> 00:44:05.010
kind of stuff and like go out and race my cars and all that kind of stuff and it

1315
00:44:05.011 --> 00:44:08.580
just seems almost impossible to do somewhere else.

1316
00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:13.581
But then you go to these other places and you see how people interact and you

1317
00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:15.150
think,

1318
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.511
God,

1319
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:17.430
we don't have that in la at all.

1320
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.230
<v 0>We have a little bit of a in La,</v>

1321
00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:23.690
but la inexorably is framed by show.

1322
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:24.760
Business does.

1323
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.040
It's just that's what it is.

1324
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:31.050
And there's so many people that even if they don't have a job in show business

1325
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.990
at one point in time had show biz aspirations and you and I are bolt in show Biz

1326
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.390
so I'm not knocking people that are doing what we do.

1327
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.410
But I'm saying is that the majority of people who want to do it,

1328
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.020
a lot of times they do it from a deficit.

1329
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.910
They do it because they need attention,

1330
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.990
they need validation,

1331
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:50.370
they need something and it could matter.

1332
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:50.581
I mean,

1333
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:51.960
that's where I came from for sure,

1334
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.940
but it manifested itself in a good way.

1335
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.640
It manifested itself in a career and a life and a,

1336
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.390
an understanding of myself by by working and creating things.

1337
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.040
<v 4>Right,</v>

1338
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.260
but did you feel you needed validation?

1339
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.101
<v 0>I'm sure it did.</v>

1340
00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:04.281
I mean,

1341
00:45:04.281 --> 00:45:04.490
sure.

1342
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.100
I'm sure that's why I got into martial arts.

1343
00:45:07.101 --> 00:45:09.890
I'm sure that's why I got into comedy and it will also,

1344
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:14.360
it was an alternative career path for me because that's the only way I was ever

1345
00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:15.260
going to have a career.

1346
00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:17.000
There's no way I was going to have a normal career.

1347
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.620
I was just way too add and way too crazy to be sitting in some sort of a fucking

1348
00:45:21.621 --> 00:45:22.251
cubicle,

1349
00:45:22.251 --> 00:45:23.870
having some sort of a job in an office.

1350
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.840
It was like I would literally feel like a rat in a cage.

1351
00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:27.661
I would go crazy.

1352
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:28.010
It's,

1353
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.420
I would never be able to pull it off,

1354
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.360
so I knew it was going to have to be something alternative,

1355
00:45:32.361 --> 00:45:33.800
something outside the norm.

1356
00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.800
I was just raised to nuts and I did martial art.

1357
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:40.910
Well I did was from age 15 to 21 was competing martial arts tournaments.

1358
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.140
So my reality was so fucked and compared to a regular person,

1359
00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:45.681
it's like this.

1360
00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:48.560
The assimilation had never taken hold,

1361
00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:49.011
so I was,

1362
00:45:49.011 --> 00:45:52.610
I was in big trouble if I didn't find something like standup comedy,

1363
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.740
but I think a lot of the people that come here,

1364
00:45:54.741 --> 00:45:56.300
they come here with something like that.

1365
00:45:56.301 --> 00:45:57.134
Like there's some,

1366
00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.000
some reason why they've chosen this,

1367
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.360
but a lot of them are trying to define themselves through their success and

1368
00:46:04.581 --> 00:46:08.780
they're trying to be somebody they're trying to like and to be around.

1369
00:46:08.781 --> 00:46:09.650
A lot of people like that.

1370
00:46:09.651 --> 00:46:11.330
It's fucking exhausting.

1371
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.230
Some of them are great.

1372
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:12.831
I all,

1373
00:46:12.831 --> 00:46:13.611
my friends live here.

1374
00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:14.960
That's the thing that keeps me here.

1375
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:19.160
Guys like Joey Diaz and Eddie Bravo and all these pals that I've had for

1376
00:46:19.161 --> 00:46:19.970
decades,

1377
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:20.690
they're all here.

1378
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:22.040
So it would make it less,

1379
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.200
less enjoyable if I live somewhere else.

1380
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:25.011
<v 4>Well,</v>

1381
00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:26.360
you know what I was saying,

1382
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:32.950
when you go and you travel somewhere and you go into a restaurant,

1383
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.910
the waiter or the waitress,

1384
00:46:34.911 --> 00:46:35.744
the bartender,

1385
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.090
that's what they do for a living.

1386
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.850
And,

1387
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.683
and that's,

1388
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:44.690
and they've made their peace with that and maybe they're even proud of it and

1389
00:46:44.691 --> 00:46:49.490
maybe they found some skill in it and that's what they do.

1390
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.823
Um,

1391
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:51.980
here,

1392
00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:52.790
the waiter,

1393
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.361
the waitress,

1394
00:46:53.361 --> 00:46:54.320
the bartender,

1395
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.420
that's not what they want to do.

1396
00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.950
This is only what they're doing temporarily until they can get some gig on a

1397
00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.960
reality show or whatever it is.

1398
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.140
And obviously it's,

1399
00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:10.790
their work suffers because you have a lot of people that are passing through.

1400
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.511
You know,

1401
00:47:11.511 --> 00:47:12.380
I feel like,

1402
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.040
like,

1403
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.873
I feel like

1404
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:20.290
La is one of the trashiest towns in the world because people are certainly in

1405
00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:23.630
the United States.

1406
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.470
Hollywood physically is a very trashy town.

1407
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.490
<v 0>Trashy in what way?</v>

1408
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.010
<v 3>On the ground.</v>

1409
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.411
I mean,

1410
00:47:30.411 --> 00:47:31.660
and I mean literally.

1411
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:31.901
Yeah.

1412
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:33.550
I mean there's a lot of graffiti,

1413
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:35.350
a lot of weeds growing everywhere.

1414
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.090
Just a lot of just kind of garbage.

1415
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:38.740
Like when you go to Phoenix,

1416
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:39.910
it doesn't look like that,

1417
00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.610
you know,

1418
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:40.841
you got to,

1419
00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:42.370
Seattle doesn't look like that.

1420
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.860
Why is that?

1421
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.630
Well to me,

1422
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:51.670
La is a bunch of people who are treating their city like you treat a rental car,

1423
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:54.041
you know,

1424
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:55.990
you treat your car one way,

1425
00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:57.220
that's your car,

1426
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.720
the rental car,

1427
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.711
and listen,

1428
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:03.640
do you want a light up a cigarette or eat some fast food or and was spilling a

1429
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:05.590
slurpee or something that's like so be it.

1430
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.873
You know,

1431
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.530
that's kind of how they feel.

1432
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:10.030
And it's funny,

1433
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.530
it's interesting.

1434
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.930
La is one of the only towns.

1435
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.950
Like if you go to Chicago and you go,

1436
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.833
hey man,

1437
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.740
this town's a piece of shit.

1438
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:22.451
People will go like,

1439
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:23.650
fuck you.

1440
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.460
First off,

1441
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.630
get the fuck outta here.

1442
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:26.201
And secondly,

1443
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:28.090
we're gonna throw down and are you kidding?

1444
00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:29.580
The bars and nightlife,

1445
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.131
the river,

1446
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:31.030
the skyline.

1447
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:33.940
Fuck the bears have cubs Wrigley.

1448
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.020
Fuck you.

1449
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.630
You got to La and go.

1450
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:38.890
La is a piece of shit.

1451
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:39.680
You got a lot of people are going.

1452
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.001
Yeah,

1453
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:40.361
I know.

1454
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:41.050
Sorry.

1455
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:41.883
I know.

1456
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.193
This is awesome.

1457
00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.110
What are you going to do?

1458
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:45.250
<v 0>There's too many people here.</v>

1459
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.360
That's another reason.

1460
00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:47.980
Another reason why it's too hectic.

1461
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.630
It's just the numbers are too crazy.

1462
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.120
New York is not that fun either in a lot of ways.

1463
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.140
Uh,

1464
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:53.411
when it,

1465
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:56.980
last time I went to New York and went through security and the woman at Tsa was

1466
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:01.981
so hostile and I know in a way that you very rarely see in la or anywhere else

1467
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:02.680
and be like,

1468
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.990
this is just a person that deals with too many human beings.

1469
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.550
Yes.

1470
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.350
I didn't say anything to you that's rude.

1471
00:49:07.351 --> 00:49:07.711
Like why?

1472
00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:08.544
Why?

1473
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:08.881
<v 3>No,</v>

1474
00:49:08.881 --> 00:49:09.571
I know.

1475
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.050
I know.

1476
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:10.321
I know.

1477
00:49:10.321 --> 00:49:15.060
Did you ever think Joe as a kid,

1478
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.650
you know,

1479
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:21.650
as a kid you thought about being an adult and he thought,

1480
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:22.051
well,

1481
00:49:22.051 --> 00:49:23.190
once I'm an adult,

1482
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:24.810
I'm going to be,

1483
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.810
I'm going to be a man and I'm going to be treated a certain way and you know,

1484
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.391
kids,

1485
00:49:30.391 --> 00:49:31.650
I'll have to listen to me.

1486
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.420
I'll be someone's dad,

1487
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.350
I'll be the boss.

1488
00:49:34.351 --> 00:49:34.710
You know,

1489
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.280
I'll be,

1490
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.290
I'm not saying I'm going to be Donald Trump.

1491
00:49:37.291 --> 00:49:38.850
What I'm saying is you'll be adult,

1492
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.833
you'll be a man.

1493
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.070
Did you ever think that people were going to do a super sing song,

1494
00:49:44.071 --> 00:49:47.640
a condescending thing to you as an adult male going,

1495
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:48.683
sir,

1496
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:49.770
take off.

1497
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.630
Take all the change out of your pockets.

1498
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.460
Completely empty the pockets.

1499
00:49:53.461 --> 00:49:54.800
That means chapstick.

1500
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:57.060
That means change keys,

1501
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.260
pocket knives,

1502
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.131
anything.

1503
00:49:59.131 --> 00:49:59.701
Combs,

1504
00:49:59.701 --> 00:50:00.211
wallet.

1505
00:50:00.211 --> 00:50:01.044
Sir,

1506
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.460
is your belt on sir,

1507
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:02.761
sir,

1508
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:03.900
take your belt off.

1509
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.823
But sir,

1510
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.840
like did you ever think you're going to have semi retarded 28 year old fucking

1511
00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:14.841
GDS talk to you in a real condescending sing song he voice when you became a man

1512
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.373
and an adult.

1513
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.640
<v 0>I can't believe it.</v>

1514
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.271
I can't believe it.

1515
00:50:18.271 --> 00:50:19.230
Every time it happens,

1516
00:50:19.231 --> 00:50:21.060
it's so annoying and so stupid.

1517
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.900
And I understand that some people have never flown before and they need to be

1518
00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:25.770
told all these things.

1519
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.610
You should be able to wear like a sticker with a star on it,

1520
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:29.031
right?

1521
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:29.721
I've been here before.

1522
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:30.610
Don't talk to me dummy.

1523
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.881
Oh Sir.

1524
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:33.380
You flown before he comes to Corolla.

1525
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.660
Put this on your shirt that they're not allowed to talk to you.

1526
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:35.910
Okay.

1527
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.180
<v 3>That's not a fucking flight.</v>

1528
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.400
I was on a southwest flight yesterday.

1529
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.070
This is a nonsmoking flight.

1530
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.690
It is 100%.

1531
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.200
Non Smoking is prohibited to smoke on this flight.

1532
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:48.370
Uh,

1533
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:51.160
no smoking in the lavatory will not be tolerated.

1534
00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.190
Tampering with disabling or destroying the lavatory,

1535
00:50:54.191 --> 00:50:55.110
smoked it tastes like,

1536
00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:56.021
Hey,

1537
00:50:56.021 --> 00:50:57.460
can we get it?

1538
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.990
No Smoking.

1539
00:50:59.020 --> 00:50:59.950
But it's not her fault though.

1540
00:50:59.951 --> 00:51:03.280
They have that at 28 fucking times.

1541
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.820
I turned to the person next to me and I said,

1542
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:12.270
we have covered 14 versions of no smoking on this flight.

1543
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.631
By the way,

1544
00:51:13.631 --> 00:51:16.990
you can say no smoking on this flight.

1545
00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.790
And that to me doesn't mean,

1546
00:51:18.791 --> 00:51:21.610
well you didn't say I couldn't smoke in the bathroom.

1547
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:23.860
That means no smoking.

1548
00:51:23.861 --> 00:51:26.040
We understand it's 2000 fucking 14

1549
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.950
<v 0>or even just say including in the bathroom and you're done.</v>

1550
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:29.810
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1551
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.700
Say No smoking on this airplane.

1552
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.690
How about that?

1553
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.523
But anyway,

1554
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:34.401
it's funny,

1555
00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:36.080
I turned to the guy next to me and I said,

1556
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.370
this bitch did five laps on smoking,

1557
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.540
but when it came to the oxygen part on the mask,

1558
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:46.130
we only did one lap on that.

1559
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.100
So it's like the no smoking,

1560
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.791
no shit,

1561
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:50.840
Sherlock thing.

1562
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.090
I got fucking 10 minutes a sing song.

1563
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:54.110
He bullshit on that.

1564
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.620
The part where there could be an actual emergency and I needed to breathe out of

1565
00:51:57.621 --> 00:51:58.280
this thing.

1566
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.140
She blew right past that part.

1567
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:00.960
And I thought,

1568
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.150
where's your priorities?

1569
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.611
<v 0>Well,</v>

1570
00:52:02.611 --> 00:52:03.271
those people,

1571
00:52:03.271 --> 00:52:03.810
again,

1572
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.490
they're meet too many fucking people.

1573
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:06.361
Yes.

1574
00:52:06.361 --> 00:52:07.390
It's just too much going on.

1575
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:07.711
They don't,

1576
00:52:07.711 --> 00:52:09.360
they don't value that interaction.

1577
00:52:09.361 --> 00:52:10.650
It's not a special interaction.

1578
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:11.000
Right.

1579
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.470
You're saying it for the 500000th time.

1580
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.300
The lady in New York,

1581
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:16.081
I gave her a,

1582
00:52:16.081 --> 00:52:18.870
I was with my family and I gave her my id,

1583
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.250
my wife's Id,

1584
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.690
and we hired daughter's with us.

1585
00:52:21.691 --> 00:52:22.710
We gave their tickets.

1586
00:52:22.711 --> 00:52:26.210
So I gave her like four tickets and it was a or five tickets and,

1587
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:26.880
and uh,

1588
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.331
two,

1589
00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:27.600
uh,

1590
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.440
two licenses.

1591
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.850
And so she looks at,

1592
00:52:29.851 --> 00:52:30.270
she'll,

1593
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.103
I don't know who's who,

1594
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:32.220
I don't know what goes where.

1595
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:32.831
Right.

1596
00:52:32.831 --> 00:52:33.301
And I said,

1597
00:52:33.301 --> 00:52:33.601
Whoa,

1598
00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:33.901
whoa.

1599
00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:34.081
I go,

1600
00:52:34.081 --> 00:52:35.100
why are you being hostile?

1601
00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:35.550
She goes,

1602
00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.480
this isn't hostile.

1603
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:37.680
If you want to see hostile show,

1604
00:52:37.681 --> 00:52:38.514
you hostile.

1605
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:38.940
You do.

1606
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:39.211
I go,

1607
00:52:39.211 --> 00:52:40.340
I would love to see hostile.

1608
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.400
Show me hostile.

1609
00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:42.871
And then she just,

1610
00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:44.880
your Jewish accent is horrible by the way.

1611
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.970
I'm just trying to be diplomatic.

1612
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:47.853
Yeah,

1613
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.421
yeah.

1614
00:52:48.421 --> 00:52:48.660
No,

1615
00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.350
I know.

1616
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:49.720
I know.

1617
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.630
And the hostile thing,

1618
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:52.080
I mean,

1619
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:52.711
I was like,

1620
00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:53.041
wow,

1621
00:52:53.041 --> 00:52:53.910
this is crazy.

1622
00:52:53.911 --> 00:52:55.320
Talk like are you,

1623
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:56.130
what are you doing?

1624
00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:00.450
Is this because you're like a Badass or is it because you're at a position of

1625
00:53:00.451 --> 00:53:00.811
power?

1626
00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:03.970
Like why the fuck do you think you can say that's on hostile?

1627
00:53:03.971 --> 00:53:04.950
If you want to see a hostile,

1628
00:53:04.951 --> 00:53:07.590
like what makes you think you're not going to get brained right now?

1629
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.610
I like are you,

1630
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:09.840
are you fucking crazy?

1631
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:11.340
Like you're talking shitty.

1632
00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:14.340
Do a person for no reasons saying I'll show you hostile.

1633
00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:15.174
So

1634
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.050
<v 3>it needs to be these folks,</v>

1635
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:23.520
whether it's the TSA or or LAPD or whoever.

1636
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:24.840
These folks need to be.

1637
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.510
Who the fuck they work for?

1638
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.820
They work for us.

1639
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.500
Someone needs to tell them they work for us.

1640
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.460
<v 1>You're not working for them.</v>

1641
00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:39.600
They work for the TSA and the TSA is the government and the government thinks

1642
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:40.434
it's separate from us.

1643
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:41.400
Right.

1644
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.750
I should point out too that most of the time that never happens.

1645
00:53:43.751 --> 00:53:44.740
Most of the time I go there,

1646
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:45.551
how you doing?

1647
00:53:45.551 --> 00:53:46.091
Good morning.

1648
00:53:46.091 --> 00:53:46.871
How you doing today?

1649
00:53:46.871 --> 00:53:47.381
Everything's good.

1650
00:53:47.381 --> 00:53:47.861
How you doing?

1651
00:53:47.861 --> 00:53:48.790
And everything's fine.

1652
00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:53.970
99.999999% but New York is the place where I've found more hostility dealing

1653
00:53:55.391 --> 00:53:56.770
with those people that sell it.

1654
00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.080
A La is probably second and then ended up pad.

1655
00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:02.140
When you travel through Oklahoma,

1656
00:54:02.141 --> 00:54:02.791
you get high.

1657
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:06.520
You doing how y'all doing great to have a safe flight.

1658
00:54:06.521 --> 00:54:06.671
Yeah,

1659
00:54:06.671 --> 00:54:08.080
it's a totally different vibe.

1660
00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.200
They just seem disinterested in la but they don't seem hostile.

1661
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:13.270
I've never encountered hostility in la,

1662
00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:13.921
<v 3>but no,</v>

1663
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:14.111
I,

1664
00:54:14.111 --> 00:54:15.060
I know it's,

1665
00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:15.391
it's,

1666
00:54:15.391 --> 00:54:15.960
it's,

1667
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.610
it's aloof,

1668
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.200
inserted,

1669
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.560
distant and it's this thing where they look at your,

1670
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:27.620
you have an exchange with another human being and they don't punctuate it with

1671
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:29.810
an ending remarks.

1672
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:32.220
So you hand them your Id,

1673
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.140
you hand them the boarding pass,

1674
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:35.070
they look at the thing,

1675
00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:35.851
they look at you,

1676
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:36.690
they look at the thing,

1677
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:41.970
they make their led Zepplin band member mark on the fucking thing,

1678
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:45.230
which I'm sure means nothing to anybody to have a highlighter.

1679
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.260
And they make their weird mark on there and then they looked down again and then

1680
00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:51.390
they hand it to you and then you walk away.

1681
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:53.880
But they don't say enjoy your flight.

1682
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.950
You got to Oklahoma.

1683
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:57.330
They say enjoy your flight

1684
00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.440
<v 1>and now let you don't even know what they wrote in your ticket.</v>

1685
00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:02.770
Like this might be bad to check his underwear.

1686
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.760
I don't think they know what they wrote on the ticket.

1687
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.210
It writing their name down right there.

1688
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:12.100
Sign Fifth member led Zepplin and if the guy gets through and he's got a fake

1689
00:55:12.101 --> 00:55:12.730
id,

1690
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.980
maybe they get in trouble like look at his fucking id.

1691
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:16.540
How did you not notice this fake id?

1692
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.740
It's got your signature on the,

1693
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.633
on the ticket.

1694
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:23.080
Well it is your mark your little suit or whatever it is.

1695
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:23.300
You know,

1696
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.390
they're very official with people like sir,

1697
00:55:25.391 --> 00:55:25.691
here,

1698
00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:27.250
please put your things in the Bin,

1699
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:28.660
take your keys out of your wallet.

1700
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.930
They stick with official but sometimes they'll break.

1701
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.050
And in La they broke pattern.

1702
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.150
They were talking about a basketball game and these three guys,

1703
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:38.470
the guy who was working the,

1704
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:38.711
uh,

1705
00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:41.740
the x ray machine and then the two guards,

1706
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.390
one of them that's in front of,

1707
00:55:43.391 --> 00:55:43.860
uh,

1708
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.041
the,

1709
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:44.300
the,

1710
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.630
the people thing where the people x ray go through.

1711
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.510
And then the other one was on the other side watching the rollers and they're

1712
00:55:49.511 --> 00:55:51.620
all going back and forth by all Colby,

1713
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:51.931
why blah,

1714
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:52.051
blah,

1715
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:52.211
blah,

1716
00:55:52.211 --> 00:55:52.451
blah,

1717
00:55:52.451 --> 00:55:53.170
and this and that.

1718
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.730
And he ain't got no free throw shot.

1719
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.713
He ain't got no three.

1720
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.710
Well you going to deal with this,

1721
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.580
right?

1722
00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.350
And then back to Sarah,

1723
00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:00.320
take your key phones out.

1724
00:56:00.321 --> 00:56:00.731
He be like,

1725
00:56:00.731 --> 00:56:01.121
wait a minute,

1726
00:56:01.121 --> 00:56:01.990
what are you talking about Kim?

1727
00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.100
My keys out of my pocket.

1728
00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.380
Like you guys aren't professional.

1729
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.071
This isn't you.

1730
00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:08.920
I just saw that the veil has been removed.

1731
00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:10.000
You guys are regular people.

1732
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:10.923
I had to fart

1733
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.833
<v 3>where I,</v>

1734
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.430
the guy and I always drives me nuts.

1735
00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.250
I don't like when they say for me,

1736
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.020
like I don't mind when they go,

1737
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.080
could you fasten your seat belt sir?

1738
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:22.430
Or could you,

1739
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.170
you know,

1740
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.210
take your keys out of,

1741
00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:24.640
uh,

1742
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.271
out of your pocket,

1743
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:25.691
put it in the tray.

1744
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:27.490
But I don't like when they go for me.

1745
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:28.810
And she bought for me.

1746
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:29.973
I had a guy,

1747
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:31.630
when I was traveling through Burbank,

1748
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.690
he needed to take the wand to me.

1749
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.790
So he said,

1750
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:36.610
uh,

1751
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.170
could you go ahead and turn around for me,

1752
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:38.980
sir?

1753
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.000
And I started to turn around and he went real quick and I was like,

1754
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:44.381
first off,

1755
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:45.161
real quick,

1756
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:46.090
like I'm,

1757
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.790
I'm halfway into turning around.

1758
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:53.350
So you have about another 0.7 seconds before I arrive at turned around number

1759
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:53.591
one.

1760
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:54.220
Number two,

1761
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.480
if I did it real quick,

1762
00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:56.740
you probably pepper spray me.

1763
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.240
Like he said,

1764
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.190
could you go ahead and turn around for me real quick sir?

1765
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:04.450
And I just fucking flew around throwing a crescent kick or something like he'd

1766
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:05.470
fucking tackle me.

1767
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.840
So I don't want to do it real quick.

1768
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.860
No Bueno mean that though.

1769
00:57:09.861 --> 00:57:10.060
The,

1770
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.440
that they're making an extra talk.

1771
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:11.841
<v 0>Well,</v>

1772
00:57:11.841 --> 00:57:12.231
yeah,

1773
00:57:12.231 --> 00:57:13.850
real quick always means like,

1774
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.590
it ain't going to be a big deal to you.

1775
00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.690
I always see it as like,

1776
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:17.991
yeah,

1777
00:57:17.991 --> 00:57:19.580
so it won't take much of your time.

1778
00:57:19.581 --> 00:57:20.414
Mr Corolla.

1779
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.350
He turn around real quick.

1780
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.691
<v 3>No,</v>

1781
00:57:21.691 --> 00:57:22.081
you know,

1782
00:57:22.081 --> 00:57:22.501
you know what?

1783
00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:23.011
I've Real,

1784
00:57:23.011 --> 00:57:24.120
you know what I realized?

1785
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:29.150
I realized a long time ago that cops and security guards do fill our talk and

1786
00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:39.030
they do fill or talk so that you won't talk to them.

1787
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.950
So if a,

1788
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:44.040
if a cop pulls you over and goes,

1789
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:46.603
uh,

1790
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.680
license and ID plays a license and registration please and then just sits there,

1791
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.720
you'll start going,

1792
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:55.350
hey man,

1793
00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:55.970
what,

1794
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:56.261
what,

1795
00:57:56.261 --> 00:57:59.830
what I do or why I was just keeping up the flow of traffic or road.

1796
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.280
But instead they always come up and they go,

1797
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:02.941
sure,

1798
00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:04.410
when I'm going to need you to do for me right now,

1799
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:07.410
let's go ahead and get your license and registration out for me.

1800
00:58:07.411 --> 00:58:07.711
Okay,

1801
00:58:07.711 --> 00:58:08.310
right now.

1802
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.830
And meanwhile they're doing this kind of pattern.

1803
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.690
That doesn't mean anything when I'm going to need you to do for me right now is

1804
00:58:15.691 --> 00:58:17.400
to go ahead and get your license.

1805
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.430
But that doesn't mean anything other than licensing registration.

1806
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.840
They keep a nice sort of white noise buzz,

1807
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:29.990
I should call it blue noise noise that cops make that stop you from going,

1808
00:58:30.421 --> 00:58:30.890
what?

1809
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:31.510
What I,

1810
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.861
Hey,

1811
00:58:31.861 --> 00:58:35.790
I was just pulling out of my dry like they don't want to hear that bullshit so

1812
00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:40.791
they just keep that low grade talk going because it's only the cops that do the

1813
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:46.160
for me right now and a lot of preamble into when I'm going to have to ask you to

1814
00:58:47.911 --> 00:58:51.480
do for me right now is to go ahead and get your license and okay.

1815
00:58:51.481 --> 00:58:52.080
Right now,

1816
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.080
like do you ever speak that way to anybody?

1817
00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.780
I mean if I wanted you to pass me the salt,

1818
00:58:57.781 --> 00:58:58.680
what I would I go,

1819
00:58:58.890 --> 00:58:59.670
Joe,

1820
00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:03.030
what I'm going to have to go ahead and do is ask you to pass me the salt.

1821
00:59:03.031 --> 00:59:03.301
Okay.

1822
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:04.134
Right now.

1823
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:06.360
Or when I just say pass me the salt.

1824
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:07.030
I like,

1825
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.520
I can't hang out with Adam anymore.

1826
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.110
This is too many words.

1827
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:12.103
Yeah.

1828
00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.950
I'm convinced they talk.

1829
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:14.880
So you don't go,

1830
00:59:14.881 --> 00:59:15.300
what?

1831
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.620
Why am I turning around?

1832
00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:16.801
Well,

1833
00:59:16.801 --> 00:59:17.581
what's this mean?

1834
00:59:17.581 --> 00:59:18.600
Why didn't do anything?

1835
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.170
Yeah.

1836
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:19.411
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1837
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:20.131
Most likely.

1838
00:59:20.131 --> 00:59:21.800
I mean d people.

1839
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:25.220
I'm very sympathetic to cops first of all because I know a lot of good cops.

1840
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:29.250
I know a lot of cops that I like guys from martial arts and right.

1841
00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:34.290
And I also know that you got to cut people a certain amount of slack when all

1842
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:35.061
day,

1843
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:37.760
every day they're dealing with people that are lying to them.

1844
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.150
Right.

1845
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.170
Dealing with Douchebag,

1846
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:40.460
he's dealing with violent people,

1847
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:41.061
dealing with people,

1848
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:41.894
committing crimes.

1849
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:47.030
I mean they have cops have like one of the worst fucking focus groups ever to

1850
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:47.780
pick from.

1851
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.960
Like if you ask a cop like what's a human being like,

1852
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.853
oh,

1853
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.020
let me tell you what I experienced at my job.

1854
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:54.441
You know,

1855
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:56.990
and ask someone who's a massage therapist,

1856
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:57.920
what's a human being like?

1857
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:58.970
Oh they seem pleasant.

1858
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.640
You know,

1859
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.720
<v 3>no hums or tense.</v>

1860
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:01.141
I know.

1861
01:00:01.141 --> 01:00:01.501
Listen,

1862
01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:06.501
my sister worked at a hair salon in silver like in the 80s on Hyperion

1863
01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:10.704
boulevard.

1864
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.060
It's like the gay section of Los Angeles.

1865
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:18.270
I said to her many years ago,

1866
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.133
I said,

1867
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:21.750
what percentage of guys you think are gay?

1868
01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:25.950
And she's like 80% of locking eyes everywhere.

1869
01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:26.784
Gay.

1870
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.990
She wasn't great at math,

1871
01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:31.650
but in her world it was 115% were gay.

1872
01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:37.050
So I think she knocked off like 35% rounded down to 80 well that's her world.

1873
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:39.240
Yeah.

1874
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.080
And her world,

1875
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.190
everyone is gay.

1876
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.330
That's a great analogy.

1877
01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.890
And it's that with cops,

1878
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.930
like what percentage of people are assholes?

1879
01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:48.200
90% you know,

1880
01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:51.780
cause that's who they're dealing with versus massage therapist.

1881
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.910
But I always had this feeling,

1882
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.570
I know he's always said that,

1883
01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:58.141
you know,

1884
01:00:58.141 --> 01:00:58.581
cops,

1885
01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:01.190
suicides are always really very high,

1886
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.870
very high stress.

1887
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.741
But you know,

1888
01:01:04.741 --> 01:01:05.011
here's,

1889
01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:05.940
here's my theory.

1890
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.910
It's kind of my black cock and porn theory.

1891
01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:10.403
I,

1892
01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.880
I have a feeling that if I walked around and had a gun on me at all times,

1893
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.470
I would have killed myself 15 times by now.

1894
01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:20.340
Really?

1895
01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:20.790
Yeah.

1896
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:24.840
I just feel like if you put a gun on a guy's hip,

1897
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:26.550
most guys,

1898
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:31.170
guys that you know have that feeling of your girlfriend dumped,

1899
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:31.710
you know,

1900
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:36.710
literally you walked into your apartment and saw your best buddy balls deep in

1901
01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:41.880
your girlfriend and then you walked out back to the car and just fucking sat

1902
01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:46.440
there with that thousand yard stare and he realized there was a gun on your

1903
01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:47.370
fucking hip.

1904
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.770
A lot of guys would just put it in her mouth.

1905
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.340
A lot of good to go back there and shoot the both the both of them and then put

1906
01:01:53.341 --> 01:01:54.150
the gun in your mouth.

1907
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:59.130
I'm just saying the modality for killing yourself,

1908
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:04.460
being strapped onto your hip 24 seven is going to put the likelihood of you

1909
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:05.910
killing yourself.

1910
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.380
I mean what if he just said,

1911
01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:08.160
hey,

1912
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.300
here's where the guy does,

1913
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.170
oh,

1914
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:13.410
he stands next to the edge of really tall bridges.

1915
01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:17.580
Those guys would have a much higher likelihood of killing themselves too because

1916
01:02:17.581 --> 01:02:20.430
every fucking time they heard a piece of bad news,

1917
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:22.440
a certain percentage of them would step off it.

1918
01:02:22.441 --> 01:02:23.274
Right?

1919
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.570
A certain percentage.

1920
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.870
I think a certain percentage of cops suicide,

1921
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:30.571
you know,

1922
01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:31.170
everyone talks,

1923
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:31.381
oh,

1924
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.570
it's stressful job and all what they seen,

1925
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:34.141
depression,

1926
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:34.291
blah,

1927
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:34.441
blah,

1928
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:35.000
blah.

1929
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A lot of it is having a suicide machine strapped to your hip all the fucking

1930
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:40.860
time.

1931
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.090
I've never thought of it that way.

1932
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.130
It's got to up the ante a little bit.

1933
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:44.430
Right.

1934
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:47.040
Certainly it's the trigger out.

1935
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.580
Literally it's right here on your hip by law,

1936
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.860
even when you're on your days off,

1937
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.150
that shit's gotta be there.

1938
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.553
Whew.

1939
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.641
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:57.520
I guess I,

1941
01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.350
you know,

1942
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.880
I've never thought about killing myself,

1943
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:00.801
so I'm,

1944
01:03:00.801 --> 01:03:01.040
I,

1945
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:01.310
I,

1946
01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.190
I kind of,

1947
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:03.024
um,

1948
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.410
when I say I relate,

1949
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.244
I don't,

1950
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:05.671
you know,

1951
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:05.910
I,

1952
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:06.271
I,

1953
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:10.590
I've always been of the idea that life will eventually get better as we talked

1954
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:11.424
about before.

1955
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.283
And I've never thought,

1956
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.370
but I've never had like a mental,

1957
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:18.300
a depression issue that I have friends who clearly have,

1958
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.670
I have friends that had real deep,

1959
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.800
unquestionable chemical problems and they,

1960
01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.620
they cured it through antidepressants,

1961
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.210
but I've never had that.

1962
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.040
So I don't understand that,

1963
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.210
that thought process,

1964
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:30.401
the,

1965
01:03:30.401 --> 01:03:31.710
the kill yourself thought process.

1966
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.880
But I've seen it enough to know that I wouldn't want everybody to have a gun

1967
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:37.170
strapped to their hip.

1968
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:37.560
They,

1969
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.221
I think you're right.

1970
01:03:38.221 --> 01:03:40.830
I think a lot of people would make that fatal mistake.

1971
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:46.340
<v 3>Initially we were talking earlier about being a dude and being 24 and just,</v>

1972
01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:51.770
we'll making really bad snap decisions

1973
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.860
<v 0>would hog go up for sure.</v>

1974
01:03:53.861 --> 01:03:55.150
And I sank or you know,

1975
01:03:55.151 --> 01:03:57.280
maybe eventually it would mellow out and they,

1976
01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:01.120
the old adage of a well armed society is a polite society.

1977
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.900
Right.

1978
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.220
But there's that expression,

1979
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:04.540
I don't remember who made it,

1980
01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:05.860
but it's that when you a,

1981
01:04:05.861 --> 01:04:07.210
all you have is a hammer.

1982
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.590
Everything looks like a nail.

1983
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.630
If there's no diplomatic solution available because you carrying a 44 magnum in

1984
01:04:13.631 --> 01:04:14.464
your pocket.

1985
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.740
<v 3>Well that's my feeling with shit.</v>

1986
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:17.574
Like,

1987
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.413
you know,

1988
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.403
uh,

1989
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.930
I mean when I was doing the man show,

1990
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.640
one of the riders got ahold of one of those tasers and I was like,

1991
01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:27.750
electric taze there's not,

1992
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.350
not this,

1993
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.580
not this serious cop.

1994
01:04:29.581 --> 01:04:32.480
One's a personal size one.

1995
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:35.730
I have been hit by one of those serious cop ones,

1996
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:38.830
but the personal kind of mail order ones,

1997
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.010
he taste every fucking person in that building.

1998
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.553
I mean,

1999
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.730
y'all Fab was it?

2000
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:45.564
When he tased you?

2001
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.710
It's uncomfortable,

2002
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:47.251
but it's,

2003
01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:47.790
you know,

2004
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:48.810
it's like wow.

2005
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:49.440
Yeah,

2006
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:49.800
that,

2007
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.790
that's what it is.

2008
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:51.521
But the point is,

2009
01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:55.860
is if you're walking around with pepper spray on your belt,

2010
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.660
you weren't going to fucking use that pepper spray at some point.

2011
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:00.930
Yeah.

2012
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.970
I mean most people would.

2013
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.860
It's almost the having it that makes you use it.

2014
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.090
You know what I'm saying?

2015
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.580
It's that kind of

2016
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:15.960
kind of thing where that's,

2017
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.321
you know,

2018
01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:17.860
I liked the idea

2019
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.650
<v 4>of people being able to protect themselves.</v>

2020
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:26.130
I also feel like you walk around with a gun strapped to your hip long enough,

2021
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.120
it's coming out at some point.

2022
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:31.150
Whereas you and I don't walk around with a gun,

2023
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:36.151
so we'd probably figure out a way other than that to resolve this issue.

2024
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:36.781
<v 0>Well,</v>

2025
01:05:36.781 --> 01:05:40.200
it certainly takes a deep responsibility.

2026
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:40.991
Like you,

2027
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:44.820
you have to have a deep understanding of the responsibility that you carry and

2028
01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:46.740
you carry it around all the time.

2029
01:05:46.741 --> 01:05:49.290
This ability to end life like that.

2030
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.110
Yeah.

2031
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:50.260
And,

2032
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.851
and I it,

2033
01:05:50.851 --> 01:05:51.550
everywhere you go

2034
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.040
<v 4>and anybody who's been out shooting,</v>

2035
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:58.270
and I've been out shooting t to feel what a,

2036
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:02.920
what a 44 feels like in your hand and then squeezing off and that just the

2037
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:03.970
recoil and everything,

2038
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:05.380
it's powerful.

2039
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:06.040
Unbelievable.

2040
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.120
You couldn't imagine pointing that at somebody and squeezing the trigger.

2041
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:15.121
The people that do that on either side of the badge to people that do that sort

2042
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.970
of routinely or cavalierly.

2043
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.070
You know the people that do the,

2044
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.710
I asked the guy for his wallet and he wouldn't give it to me,

2045
01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:24.544
so I shot him.

2046
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:26.070
It's,

2047
01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:30.880
it seems insane because if you've actually gone down to a range and just felt

2048
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:34.720
that power and that responsibility and just the,

2049
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.490
the,

2050
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:38.440
the recoil,

2051
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:43.420
the kickback and this sort of visceral whatever firing off a few rounds from

2052
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:48.421
that 44 you couldn't imagine pointing it at somebody and squeezing that trigger.

2053
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:49.571
<v 0>Well,</v>

2054
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:50.351
it's Kinda interesting.

2055
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:50.831
Like I'm,

2056
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:55.831
I am 100% for people being allowed to possess firearms,

2057
01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:01.620
but I also am 100% shocked that more firearm deaths and accidents don't happen.

2058
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:08.440
If you think of the idea that all these people around us,

2059
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:12.850
millions of people around us can legally have guns and if they legally have

2060
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:13.181
guns,

2061
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:14.014
like what does the,

2062
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:15.090
how come we're not hearing pop,

2063
01:07:15.091 --> 01:07:17.620
pop pow like guns going off left and right.

2064
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:18.730
People are retarded.

2065
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.161
Like I'm,

2066
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:22.870
I'm shocked every time I get on the highway and I'm amazed that people can go 70

2067
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:23.704
miles an hour,

2068
01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.030
a couple of feet away from another thing going 70 miles an hour and they know

2069
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:31.180
just fucking slamming each other left and right back and forth.

2070
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.430
Constant maze of accidents.

2071
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:33.891
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2072
01:07:33.891 --> 01:07:34.191
I know.

2073
01:07:34.191 --> 01:07:34.550
I,

2074
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.120
I,

2075
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:35.630
I'm,

2076
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:37.880
I think that same way every time I drive.

2077
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.880
And I think the same way when I hear that,

2078
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:41.953
you know,

2079
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.190
there's a gun,

2080
01:07:43.191 --> 01:07:43.700
you know,

2081
01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.730
however many guns are in circulation in the United States,

2082
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.840
basically one for every citizen that's out there and we all know about

2083
01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.100
David Arquette or Andy Dick or any other nut job that's out there.

2084
01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:02.870
You take all the people that are having emotional issues are a little bit off

2085
01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:06.950
and all the medication that's out there and all the booze that's out there.

2086
01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.620
And then you mix that with all the guns that are out there.

2087
01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.700
Why do we not step outside of the studio and hear gunfire going left and right?

2088
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:17.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.510
It's,

2090
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:21.510
it's kind of amazing you think about it and it's also amazing how many fucking

2091
01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:25.740
people there are out there that are going through problems that keep it

2092
01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:26.574
together.

2093
01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:27.870
There's a lot of people out there,

2094
01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:32.871
their life is shit and turmoil and they still manage to get to work every day,

2095
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.180
do their fucking job and pull out of the ashes,

2096
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:36.570
right?

2097
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:38.220
We concentrate on the people that just go,

2098
01:08:38.221 --> 01:08:39.054
fuck this,

2099
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.953
boom.

2100
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:42.120
But how many people think about going,

2101
01:08:42.121 --> 01:08:44.490
fuck this and make it and figure it out.

2102
01:08:44.491 --> 01:08:46.170
And then 10 years later,

2103
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:47.730
a 10 years ago,

2104
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.990
my life was in shambles.

2105
01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.250
I was ready to kill myself.

2106
01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.510
Now look at me.

2107
01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:52.470
I'm happy.

2108
01:08:52.471 --> 01:08:53.580
I'm doing great.

2109
01:08:53.581 --> 01:08:54.391
I've got a family,

2110
01:08:54.391 --> 01:08:54.571
but,

2111
01:08:54.571 --> 01:08:54.861
but blah,

2112
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.031
blah,

2113
01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:55.161
blah,

2114
01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:55.291
blah,

2115
01:08:55.291 --> 01:08:55.600
blah.

2116
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.071
Oh God,

2117
01:08:56.071 --> 01:08:57.740
I was thrown out of the police academy,

2118
01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.370
killed myself,

2119
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:02.370
was whatever it is,

2120
01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.110
whatever it is that allows people to pull through,

2121
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:04.621
I mean,

2122
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:08.070
I'm all for it because I think we're all people.

2123
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:12.240
I know that you can handle driving a car and I know that I can handle driving a

2124
01:09:12.241 --> 01:09:12.720
car,

2125
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.980
but I also know that some people are going to drive drunk,

2126
01:09:16.981 --> 01:09:17.820
fucked up,

2127
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.110
go 120 miles an hour,

2128
01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:21.120
slam into other people and kill people.

2129
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.860
So if that person exists,

2130
01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:24.540
should we keep that right from everybody?

2131
01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:24.841
No.

2132
01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:25.441
I say no.

2133
01:09:25.441 --> 01:09:29.040
I say people should be allowed to drive cars until they show that they're a

2134
01:09:29.041 --> 01:09:30.600
danger driving a car.

2135
01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.321
Unfortunately,

2136
01:09:31.321 --> 01:09:32.550
there's only one way to do that.

2137
01:09:32.551 --> 01:09:34.500
You got to fuck up somebody else's time,

2138
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.010
right?

2139
01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:35.843
You got to fuck up.

2140
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.660
And that's,

2141
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.650
that's the real issue.

2142
01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:42.690
It's like the amount of actual cars driving in comparison to the amount of fatal

2143
01:09:42.691 --> 01:09:46.050
accidents is fucking insanely high.

2144
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.820
Insanely high.

2145
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.330
I mean,

2146
01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:53.190
the odds of you driving around and not having a fatal accident are pretty

2147
01:09:53.191 --> 01:09:54.360
fucking Sporty,

2148
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:54.930
right?

2149
01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:55.890
They're pretty sporty.

2150
01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:57.533
<v 4>But</v>

2151
01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.340
<v 1>when things do go wrong,</v>

2152
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.640
people automatically look for the most drastic measure.

2153
01:10:03.641 --> 01:10:05.320
Like we got to take guns away from people.

2154
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.490
We've got to pull the guns,

2155
01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:07.810
we've got a Google car,

2156
01:10:07.811 --> 01:10:08.351
everything,

2157
01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:08.891
no more,

2158
01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:10.360
no more driving your own car.

2159
01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:11.111
That's common.

2160
01:10:11.111 --> 01:10:13.270
Adam Corolla and I know you're a car nut,

2161
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.680
that Google car shit.

2162
01:10:14.681 --> 01:10:15.850
Once they get that down,

2163
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:19.180
there's going to be no reason for you to be able to weave in and out of Google

2164
01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:20.740
cars and make it to work.

2165
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:21.591
<v 4>Well,</v>

2166
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:22.424
you know,

2167
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:23.563
we,

2168
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.800
I always say we're bizarre society and we should always just work big to small

2169
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.440
and we don't like it.

2170
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:36.340
Take Los Angeles were,

2171
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.890
you know,

2172
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.350
basically last in education.

2173
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.030
Our schools are nuts.

2174
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:45.710
It is nuts and our schools are failing our kids.

2175
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:49.610
And then you turn on the news and they say,

2176
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.760
new legislation out of Sacramento wanting to ban e-cigarettes and years,

2177
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.053
you're like,

2178
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.373
uh,

2179
01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.180
sorry Ethan Hawke.

2180
01:10:59.181 --> 01:10:59.550
But the,

2181
01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:00.480
the point are a,

2182
01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.410
so I think an oh Stephen Dorff the point is this,

2183
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:04.880
get those guys confused.

2184
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:06.650
E cigarettes.

2185
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.410
Who the fuck cares about e cigarettes?

2186
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.273
Now look,

2187
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:15.970
I don't hope that my kids grow up to smoke e-cigarettes,

2188
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:21.270
but I don't give a fuck if there's some 45 year old guy who's trying to get off

2189
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:25.890
the bus and a standing outside of his job smoking a cigarette.

2190
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.950
And I walked by and get a little fucking water vapor,

2191
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:29.491
uh,

2192
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:30.510
on my scalp.

2193
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:31.860
I'm fine with that.

2194
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:32.750
Uh,

2195
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:33.330
I,

2196
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:33.820
I,

2197
01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.653
I would,

2198
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.070
I wouldn't give a shit if everyone smoked in east cigarette.

2199
01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:42.540
If we could get from 50th in education up into the top 20.

2200
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:43.831
I don't know.

2201
01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:46.800
Why were we have,

2202
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:47.520
you know,

2203
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.520
the worst traffic congestion on the planet and the worst schools and you know,

2204
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:53.820
in America.

2205
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.050
And yet every piece of legislation is surrounded about,

2206
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:58.930
you know,

2207
01:11:58.930 --> 01:11:59.310
uh,

2208
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:03.260
fast food workers need to start wearing gloves to handle the food back.

2209
01:12:03.261 --> 01:12:04.094
You know,

2210
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:05.490
I don't give a fuck about that.

2211
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:07.050
I don't give a fuck about e cigarettes.

2212
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.550
I don't know who does.

2213
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:14.150
I don't know an individual that has ever been harmed by an east cigarette and I

2214
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:17.730
don't know an individual it's ever been harmed by guy works at Taco bell making

2215
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:19.830
this fucking Burrito by hand.

2216
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.280
I everything I've eaten in my entire life that's come from a restaurant,

2217
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.440
some guy made with his hands,

2218
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:26.910
I'm fucking fine.

2219
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.140
What a don't like.

2220
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:29.760
It's the school's being last.

2221
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.830
Why that's not an issue.

2222
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.813
I don't know.

2223
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.690
<v 0>I don't like both.</v>

2224
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.140
I don't like dude's a dirty hands and making my tacos and I don't like shitty

2225
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:37.974
schools.

2226
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.840
Right?

2227
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.950
<v 4>But to me,</v>

2228
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.640
if you give me a choice and I'm a in Sacramento,

2229
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:47.090
I'm going to focus on the schools and when I get that settled,

2230
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:49.960
then I'm going to focus on the guy guys picking this nose and making money.

2231
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.200
<v 0>But obviously the people that are bringing up this e-cigarette thing,</v>

2232
01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:53.501
it's a,

2233
01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:56.410
it's coming from someone in the health department and looking for another thing

2234
01:12:56.411 --> 01:12:57.100
to do.

2235
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:57.341
I mean,

2236
01:12:57.341 --> 01:12:58.360
that's the only thing that makes sense.

2237
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:00.340
It's like some new project to take on.

2238
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.730
When you look at the actual effects of the secondhand vapor,

2239
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:05.160
it's nonexistent.

2240
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:05.700
There's nothing,

2241
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.550
there's no data,

2242
01:13:06.551 --> 01:13:07.990
there's nothing that shows his dangerous,

2243
01:13:07.991 --> 01:13:08.770
it snows.

2244
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:12.220
The other problem though is those big fucking cannons that these dudes are

2245
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.054
carrying around.

2246
01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:15.340
People are carrying around these big giant electric,

2247
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:19.060
like Brian Red Band had one and he was blown it in here and I'm like,

2248
01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.290
I'm breathing in that stuff.

2249
01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:22.030
Like that's not the same.

2250
01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.040
It's like one of those blue e cigs,

2251
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:24.510
right?

2252
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:25.091
They're all those.

2253
01:13:25.091 --> 01:13:26.640
All those things are not created equal.

2254
01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.710
I think about what

2255
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:33.710
<v 4>you're breathing in when a guy's got a leaf blower going and your neighbor's</v>

2256
01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:39.780
driveway and he's just fucking all the shit that's on the ground.

2257
01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:41.160
All the pesticides,

2258
01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:41.670
everything,

2259
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:42.690
all the pollen,

2260
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:47.870
all the Dander and all this shit that is vulcanized rubber and Cockroach,

2261
01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:48.900
fecal matter.

2262
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:53.370
When that all goes fucking airborne and now you're taking your dog or your kid

2263
01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:54.720
for a walk up the street.

2264
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:56.400
What do you think that's like?

2265
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.030
Hmm.

2266
01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:02.030
And what's it like when you're walking down a busy sidewalk in downtown La and a

2267
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:07.090
big municipal bus goes blowing by at 40 miles an hour and whatever.

2268
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:09.030
Kitten kicked up and coming off of that.

2269
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.933
Yup.

2270
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.620
E-Cigarette any day.

2271
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:13.570
And the other thing to think about his brake dust,

2272
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:14.810
people don't think about break.

2273
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.693
Oh yeah.

2274
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.740
Brake dust is real everywhere around you.

2275
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:18.941
Everywhere you go,

2276
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:19.870
when you see traffic,

2277
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.980
you have brake dust.

2278
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.491
It's in the air.

2279
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.600
People are hitting their brakes,

2280
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:23.590
the brakes are disintegrating.

2281
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:24.640
It's all over the wheels.

2282
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:25.750
Whenever you clean your car,

2283
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:26.291
you know this,

2284
01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:28.510
you cleaned your wheel and you see all that black powder.

2285
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.850
Well that Shit's not just stuck to your wheel.

2286
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:31.840
It's in the air.

2287
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:34.060
And people who live near highways,

2288
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.940
they're breathing that stuff in all fucking day.

2289
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.060
It's uh,

2290
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.600
by the way,

2291
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.860
the biggest manufacturer brake pads,

2292
01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:43.300
it's called Raybestos.

2293
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.051
Oh No,

2294
01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:44.950
what a terrible name.

2295
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:46.060
It,

2296
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.220
I think they were around before as best as Swiss.

2297
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:49.150
It's bad as it is,

2298
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.520
but Raybestos yeah,

2299
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:50.951
they really,

2300
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:51.784
they were,

2301
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.970
well I hadn't manufactured around the forest pesto's well,

2302
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.833
no,

2303
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.400
before asbestos was bad.

2304
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.731
Oh,

2305
01:14:57.731 --> 01:14:58.480
before it was bad.

2306
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.750
And I think Ray Bestus if we've got to look it up on your computer,

2307
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:04.990
but I think it probably had his best though Senate.

2308
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.100
I mean because there's a ton of heat generated by the brakes.

2309
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:10.270
That makes sense.

2310
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:15.270
And as it needs to be something that it's going to be heat resistant and not

2311
01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:15.881
where,

2312
01:15:15.881 --> 01:15:16.060
Ah,

2313
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:16.340
you know,

2314
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.530
it's not chunk of rubber.

2315
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:18.080
Yeah,

2316
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.913
yeah.

2317
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.450
Huh.

2318
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.290
That's interesting.

2319
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.070
It's interesting too that they haven't figured out anything better for a break.

2320
01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.960
Then I'm a piston that's slams a pad against a piece of steel that's next to

2321
01:15:28.961 --> 01:15:29.441
your wheel.

2322
01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:31.050
It gives you friction.

2323
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.660
Yeah.

2324
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:32.980
Incredible amounts of friction.

2325
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.140
I mean that's,

2326
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.730
that's what they figured out for breaks.

2327
01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.020
I just uh,

2328
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:43.050
got back from a vintage race last weekend and I drove an old Datsun and the

2329
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:47.260
breaks and the old Datsun,

2330
01:15:47.261 --> 01:15:51.100
although they don't work nearly as good as the one in the new car,

2331
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.810
it's exact same thing.

2332
01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:53.710
So Piston,

2333
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:55.960
it's a pad pushes down,

2334
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:57.670
it's eroder squeezes,

2335
01:15:57.671 --> 01:16:00.340
it creates friction and that's that.

2336
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.420
Um,

2337
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.770
now you know,

2338
01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:06.460
but the steering wheel and the wheels and the internal combustion engine haven't

2339
01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.040
changed.

2340
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.380
Not much either.

2341
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.890
I mean it's all the rear end and the transmission,

2342
01:16:11.891 --> 01:16:16.780
it's all a thousand times better in a new car than it is in one of these old

2343
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:17.591
race cars.

2344
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:19.570
But it's still just same old,

2345
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:23.440
same old and the electronic suspensions to the suspensions nowadays with

2346
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:28.000
stability management systems and traction control and all the different

2347
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.070
calculations that car's making.

2348
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.810
Oh dreidel I was driving,

2349
01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:34.510
my wife's to Audi and it applied the break for me.

2350
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.153
Why?

2351
01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.510
Because I was driving like a dick.

2352
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.460
So it started slowing you down?

2353
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:40.001
No,

2354
01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:43.120
it said you're going to t boned the car that's ahead of you.

2355
01:16:43.121 --> 01:16:45.340
Like you're going to go up the ass of the car in front of you.

2356
01:16:45.341 --> 01:16:45.731
And I'm like,

2357
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:47.650
I know what I'm doing and here's how I drive,

2358
01:16:47.651 --> 01:16:48.011
you know,

2359
01:16:48.011 --> 01:16:48.790
and it's like,

2360
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:49.510
well,

2361
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:50.890
according to our data,

2362
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.510
you're going to hit this guy.

2363
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:57.870
I just picked up my foot to put it on the brake pedal.

2364
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:02.410
And it popped out of my foot and depressed for me.

2365
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:03.603
Wow.

2366
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:05.920
Thing basically said was,

2367
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:07.211
you know,

2368
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:10.580
I was doing a show at like the Irvine Improv,

2369
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:12.290
all the fucking traffic,

2370
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:12.531
you know,

2371
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:13.790
between here and there.

2372
01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.030
And you know,

2373
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.910
I had to be there at eight o'clock or whatever.

2374
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.390
And I was trying to make some time just driving down the Hollywood freeway.

2375
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.660
And so I was on it when there was a little opening and then brake lights and

2376
01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:27.260
this thing broke for me.

2377
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.660
And I'm,

2378
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.060
I'm,

2379
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.890
because I do a lot of driving.

2380
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:34.550
I'm used to just doing it on my own,

2381
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.413
you know.

2382
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.971
<v 0>Did you,</v>

2383
01:17:35.971 --> 01:17:36.241
um,

2384
01:17:36.241 --> 01:17:38.010
see that controversy about that?

2385
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.820
Um,

2386
01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:42.990
that a reporter was the named Jeremy K.

2387
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:42.991
Hill?

2388
01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:43.920
What the fuck was his name,

2389
01:17:43.921 --> 01:17:44.754
who died?

2390
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:45.211
Who,

2391
01:17:45.211 --> 01:17:45.360
uh,

2392
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:45.631
was,

2393
01:17:45.631 --> 01:17:45.990
uh,

2394
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.950
he exposed,

2395
01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:47.784
um,

2396
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:52.290
a bunch of shit about a general Petraeus and some other generals and he was

2397
01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:52.540
like,

2398
01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.410
just generally like a rabble rouser type reporter.

2399
01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:56.221
And,

2400
01:17:56.221 --> 01:17:56.610
uh,

2401
01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:01.020
he was constantly worried that he was going to get killed,

2402
01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.840
constantly talking to people that were saying they were going to kill him.

2403
01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.190
And then one day,

2404
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:06.900
like four o'clock in the morning,

2405
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:11.930
driving down sunset goes like a hundred miles away into a tree with no evidence

2406
01:18:12.331 --> 01:18:14.190
that he's tried to slow down or stop.

2407
01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.610
The engine goes flying from the car.

2408
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.730
Explosion like Michael Hastings,

2409
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.600
Michael Hastings,

2410
01:18:21.601 --> 01:18:22.434
that's his name.

2411
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:23.430
Yeah,

2412
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.960
I do remember that story.

2413
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.153
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:26.520
You know,

2415
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.450
I just kind of went away,

2416
01:18:27.451 --> 01:18:28.284
didn't it?

2417
01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.011
Well,

2418
01:18:29.011 --> 01:18:29.844
the thing is,

2419
01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:33.780
everything just kind of goes away now because there's so much,

2420
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:34.920
there's so much,

2421
01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:37.680
and everyone is broken off.

2422
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:38.663
You know?

2423
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.200
I don't know.

2424
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:43.710
I don't know if we could have another Watergate,

2425
01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.813
you know,

2426
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:50.060
because there's just too many people that are into their shit and there's,

2427
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:52.831
you know,

2428
01:18:52.831 --> 01:18:55.530
there used to be three news outlets,

2429
01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:56.100
you know,

2430
01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.660
the major three networks,

2431
01:18:57.661 --> 01:18:58.950
whatever the evening news,

2432
01:18:58.951 --> 01:18:59.850
Walter Cronkite,

2433
01:18:59.851 --> 01:19:00.684
whatever.

2434
01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:03.750
Now there's just so many outlets,

2435
01:19:03.751 --> 01:19:04.620
so much,

2436
01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:09.360
so many stories and so much that needs to feed that machine.

2437
01:19:09.361 --> 01:19:12.790
You don't do 24 hour news stations,

2438
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:14.000
outlets.

2439
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.120
You've got to keep that shit.

2440
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.320
You got to keep those plates spinning and our attention span,

2441
01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.580
it's just not long enough.

2442
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:20.941
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:23.570
There's always any margin airliner thing.

2444
01:19:23.571 --> 01:19:23.841
Right,

2445
01:19:23.841 --> 01:19:23.940
right

2446
01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.860
<v 4>thing and we just don't care.</v>

2447
01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.490
Yeah,

2448
01:19:26.490 --> 01:19:29.550
and and I mean ultimately we're sorta narcissist,

2449
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:30.960
but then secondly,

2450
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:35.010
there's just something new to replace something every day,

2451
01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:35.911
all day.

2452
01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:37.600
And there's nothing that they just,

2453
01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:39.030
nothing could hold our attention.

2454
01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:41.550
I mean I was very young,

2455
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.960
but I remember Watergate and I remember that was it.

2456
01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:49.830
That's all anybody talked about was Watergate,

2457
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:51.060
Watergate,

2458
01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:51.770
Watergate,

2459
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.980
that,

2460
01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.490
that that's what happened.

2461
01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.530
That's what was happening.

2462
01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:59.520
I don't know if we're going to have that ability anymore.

2463
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.630
I mean timber level,

2464
01:20:00.631 --> 01:20:01.740
this is probably the closest thing.

2465
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.101
Yeah.

2466
01:20:02.101 --> 01:20:06.930
I mean you're going to have to have something on that scale and even then

2467
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:12.170
there's going to be a certain and a fairly large segment of society that's still

2468
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:17.280
getting caught up on honey booboo and doesn't give a shit about the tower and

2469
01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:17.621
maintenance.

2470
01:20:17.621 --> 01:20:18.570
I didn't even know about it.

2471
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.560
<v 1>And September 11th was also,</v>

2472
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:24.760
you think about the time of 2001 is compared to the time now,

2473
01:20:24.761 --> 01:20:25.250
the Internet,

2474
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:26.380
that use of the Internet,

2475
01:20:26.381 --> 01:20:26.601
the,

2476
01:20:26.601 --> 01:20:27.970
the spread of information.

2477
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.230
It wasn't even close to being the same thing and totally not just the sheer

2478
01:20:32.231 --> 01:20:36.070
volume of fucking stories that you get every day that you have to sift through.

2479
01:20:36.071 --> 01:20:38.350
Interesting non-interesting ridiculous,

2480
01:20:38.351 --> 01:20:40.030
baffling animal attacks,

2481
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:41.260
explosions,

2482
01:20:41.261 --> 01:20:42.071
poisonings,

2483
01:20:42.071 --> 01:20:42.910
oil leaks,

2484
01:20:42.911 --> 01:20:44.020
Jesus fucking Christ,

2485
01:20:44.021 --> 01:20:44.980
another plane crash,

2486
01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:45.341
boom,

2487
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:45.701
boom,

2488
01:20:45.701 --> 01:20:46.031
boom,

2489
01:20:46.031 --> 01:20:46.361
boom,

2490
01:20:46.361 --> 01:20:46.930
boom.

2491
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:47.763
It never ends.

2492
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.910
<v 4>And I don't know,</v>

2493
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:49.833
you know,

2494
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:55.500
I don't know how much of this were geared to or supposed to ingest and digest

2495
01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:04.510
like I don't know.

2496
01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:05.860
As human beings,

2497
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.340
I know we haven't changed biologically that much and the past several hundred

2498
01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:13.720
years,

2499
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.610
but yet things have changed a lot.

2500
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.440
<v 1>As of years.</v>

2501
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:16.971
We were very,

2502
01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:17.570
very,

2503
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:20.110
very similar to the people that live 50,000 years ago.

2504
01:21:20.111 --> 01:21:20.320
Right?

2505
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:20.950
Right.

2506
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:25.950
<v 4>But yet you're holding a device in your hand that has more computing power than</v>

2507
01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:30.400
the first Gemini Rocket Launch.

2508
01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.070
So what are we supposed to do with that,

2509
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:38.770
that information and how are we supposed to process it?

2510
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.350
And when does it become detrimental?

2511
01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.300
Like we're,

2512
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:48.330
are we supposed to be somewhere processing information all the time?

2513
01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:51.641
I mean,

2514
01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:52.474
I'll give you a,

2515
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.490
I was just saying this,

2516
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.500
but I found it sort of interesting.

2517
01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:58.960
I was doing this,

2518
01:21:58.961 --> 01:22:00.190
a vintage car race,

2519
01:22:00.191 --> 01:22:05.191
so I was out to dinner after the race with a guy who owns an airline,

2520
01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:07.630
not a big one,

2521
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.520
like a medium size one.

2522
01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.830
And I said,

2523
01:22:11.831 --> 01:22:12.320
uh,

2524
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:12.930
tease man,

2525
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:13.210
what,

2526
01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:14.980
what went on with that seven,

2527
01:22:14.981 --> 01:22:15.371
seven,

2528
01:22:15.371 --> 01:22:15.821
seven,

2529
01:22:15.821 --> 01:22:17.080
I'm Malaysian plane.

2530
01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:17.411
You know,

2531
01:22:17.411 --> 01:22:17.960
like you're,

2532
01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.940
you own airline,

2533
01:22:18.941 --> 01:22:19.810
what do you think?

2534
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:20.771
And he said,

2535
01:22:20.771 --> 01:22:21.041
yeah,

2536
01:22:21.041 --> 01:22:21.581
I don't know.

2537
01:22:21.581 --> 01:22:22.414
And I said,

2538
01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.613
can you just,

2539
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:26.260
can you dismantle or,

2540
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.510
or make those course transponders on the seven,

2541
01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:29.811
seven,

2542
01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:34.450
seven dysfunctional can you can just flip a switch or have to pull a fuse or

2543
01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:35.800
breaker or something like that.

2544
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:36.933
And he said,

2545
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.070
it was about seven o'clock.

2546
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:43.030
We were just sitting there and some Mexican food joint,

2547
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:43.960
uh,

2548
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.010
outside of the track at Laguna Saca and a northern California.

2549
01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.301
And he said,

2550
01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:50.134
uh,

2551
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:51.003
hold on,

2552
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.760
let me,

2553
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.780
let me hit my guy.

2554
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.760
Now his guy is,

2555
01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:55.900
when you run an airline,

2556
01:22:55.901 --> 01:22:58.300
you have to have like a chief engineer or something like that.

2557
01:22:58.301 --> 01:23:01.690
It basically tells you all the specs on the planes and the INS and outs and how

2558
01:23:01.691 --> 01:23:05.260
many hours engines have on them and what tires to get all,

2559
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.180
you've got to have a couple of those guys,

2560
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:08.014
right?

2561
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:09.063
So he said,

2562
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.120
let me hit my guy.

2563
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:12.040
So he just picked up his phone.

2564
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:14.110
He didn't get up and leave or anything.

2565
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:17.650
He just picked up his phone and he texted this dude,

2566
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:18.430
you know,

2567
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:21.130
and now I didn't think about it to later,

2568
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:24.940
but this was Saturday night at seven 30 at night.

2569
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:25.871
Well,

2570
01:23:25.871 --> 01:23:26.800
his dude,

2571
01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.900
he's probably eating dinner with his family.

2572
01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:31.210
Maybe he's fucking his girlfriend,

2573
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:33.520
or maybe he's out to dinner with his wife,

2574
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.260
but now his little device starts buzzing and this is a little device.

2575
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:42.310
It's the boss man on his device.

2576
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.500
He can't get back to him on Monday.

2577
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.160
The boss man just asked him a question and now he's got to find out how you

2578
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:55.120
dismantle a beacon on a seven,

2579
01:23:55.121 --> 01:23:55.480
seven,

2580
01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.220
seven.

2581
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.860
Now I don't know if he knows it or he's got to go look it up.

2582
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.360
But either way,

2583
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:06.040
if this guy is sitting with his kids or sit with his wife or fucking his

2584
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:06.874
mistress,

2585
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.810
he's got to go,

2586
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:08.860
oh shit,

2587
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.860
I got to figure this shit out and give this guy an answer now because he's the

2588
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:16.300
boss and he just asked me,

2589
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.680
fuck that.

2590
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:18.820
It's Saturday night,

2591
01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.410
right?

2592
01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:19.931
Fuck that.

2593
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:21.940
It's the weekend and I'm with my family.

2594
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.950
[inaudible] I got to know,

2595
01:24:23.951 --> 01:24:27.730
and this guy probably had a little anxiety and this guy probably thought,

2596
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:29.110
Eh,

2597
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:30.940
I'll get back to him Monday and then thought,

2598
01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:31.780
fuck,

2599
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.770
I don't want to do that.

2600
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.720
I better get back with him now.

2601
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:38.380
He probably wants to know now and this guy probably had to get up and go

2602
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.214
somewhere,

2603
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.390
hop on a computer,

2604
01:24:40.391 --> 01:24:41.230
do something,

2605
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.131
figure out that,

2606
01:24:42.131 --> 01:24:42.670
whatever.

2607
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:43.990
And then he had to go right,

2608
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:45.610
this guy back on a Saturday night.

2609
01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:45.941
Well,

2610
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:46.774
that's where,

2611
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.250
that's how we're living now.

2612
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:49.960
And I don't think it's good

2613
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:51.470
<v 1>data aspect of it.</v>

2614
01:24:51.471 --> 01:24:52.304
I agree with you.

2615
01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.673
That's pretty rare.

2616
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.510
I think also the amount of numbers that are coming in,

2617
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.380
uh,

2618
01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.000
I think we're eventually going to adapt.

2619
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:01.760
I think human beings have a thing called Dunbar's number.

2620
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:05.330
Are you aware that you can only keep about 150 relationships?

2621
01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.470
150 friendships,

2622
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.480
150 people you know by name and face.

2623
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.860
After that shit starts getting weird and I'm sure you've encountered that.

2624
01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.091
You,

2625
01:25:12.091 --> 01:25:13.220
you meet people and they go,

2626
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.210
hey,

2627
01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:16.100
it was great when I met you before we had a good time.

2628
01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:16.461
Remember?

2629
01:25:16.461 --> 01:25:18.650
And you're sure I don't remember you.

2630
01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:19.521
There's no room.

2631
01:25:19.521 --> 01:25:20.870
You have no room in your hard drive.

2632
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.280
Right?

2633
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.050
Because we're not really designed to meet a million people over the course of a

2634
01:25:24.051 --> 01:25:24.321
life,

2635
01:25:24.321 --> 01:25:26.930
which you very well have probably met a million people.

2636
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:30.770
The average person doesn't get to do that in a tribal situation 50,000 years

2637
01:25:30.771 --> 01:25:31.160
ago.

2638
01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.900
We carry those same genetics today.

2639
01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.730
And I think that is also,

2640
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:39.790
that also applies to dealing with danger and the idea of hearing about news

2641
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.340
because news and danger usually affects you.

2642
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:46.700
But when that news and danger is a plane halfway around the world,

2643
01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.430
it becomes a sort of a weird abstract thing.

2644
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.960
And you're getting all these abstract,

2645
01:25:50.961 --> 01:25:53.630
never negative things that are happening all the time.

2646
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.740
Every fucking point of the globe sends you it's worst news.

2647
01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:58.251
Oh,

2648
01:25:58.251 --> 01:25:59.390
we found a new serial killer,

2649
01:25:59.391 --> 01:26:00.224
only eats babies.

2650
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.771
Well,

2651
01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:03.080
we found a fucking guy who has been living in the woods and you know,

2652
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.221
we found this,

2653
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:06.020
we found that everything that's fucked up,

2654
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:10.190
everything terrible and it all comes into your head and you have to,

2655
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.290
at this point in our lives,

2656
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.273
you have to filter it.

2657
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.440
If you don't feel dread,

2658
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.920
you will truly go insane.

2659
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.080
Like your biology can't manage it.

2660
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:19.490
You're not designed for it.

2661
01:26:19.491 --> 01:26:20.480
It's not a normal thing.

2662
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:22.460
It's not new and we haven't adapted yet.

2663
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.900
So you better manage it.

2664
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:28.040
You better like make a conscious decision to manage it or it'll fucking move

2665
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:30.140
your life in the way it wants to.

2666
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:32.000
It will change your thought patterns,

2667
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:34.040
change your perceptions of the world.

2668
01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.900
And based on an insane number of 7 billion human beings,

2669
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:40.070
unusual events,

2670
01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.600
7 billion,

2671
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.200
which is 7,000 million human beings problems,

2672
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:45.770
right?

2673
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.180
That's too many.

2674
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:48.980
You're supposed to deal with 150.

2675
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.390
That's why you have this number,

2676
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.610
Dunbar's number that's in your fucking head.

2677
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.570
One 50.

2678
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:54.410
That's it.

2679
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.570
Not 7 billion.

2680
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:58.250
That's fucking crazy.

2681
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:01.820
So that change has been so radical and so quick.

2682
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:04.940
There's no way our biology right now is caught up to it,

2683
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:09.260
but I bet future generations will have some sort of an alteration in their

2684
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:10.110
ability to,

2685
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:15.130
to either absorb massive amounts of information or some sort of a change in the

2686
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:17.600
way we process that information.

2687
01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:18.480
<v 4>Right?</v>

2688
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.050
Right.

2689
01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:19.351
And,

2690
01:27:19.351 --> 01:27:19.860
uh,

2691
01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.860
we're just like the Guinea pigs and we see how much medication and how much we

2692
01:27:25.201 --> 01:27:28.200
can all freak out over what's going on.

2693
01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:28.900
And it's,

2694
01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.551
it's true.

2695
01:27:29.551 --> 01:27:29.750
And I,

2696
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.050
and I feel the same way.

2697
01:27:31.051 --> 01:27:33.780
I just feel inundated and overwhelmed.

2698
01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:37.560
And like there's so much coming at me at once.

2699
01:27:37.561 --> 01:27:38.230
Concept.

2700
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:38.381
<v 1>Well,</v>

2701
01:27:38.381 --> 01:27:39.610
you have to think about language.

2702
01:27:39.611 --> 01:27:41.290
When language burst onto the picture,

2703
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.850
when people started communicating with each other and recognizable sounds almost

2704
01:27:45.851 --> 01:27:50.110
immediately people started explaining their problems and all,

2705
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.810
they started commiserating and started figuring each other out,

2706
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:54.190
and from there,

2707
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.540
from that point on,

2708
01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.580
the world got way more complicated.

2709
01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:02.610
It wasn't just do what you feel and and following instincts and make grunts like

2710
01:28:02.921 --> 01:28:06.790
we're a tiger is like you're actually communicating.

2711
01:28:06.791 --> 01:28:07.780
You're complaining,

2712
01:28:07.781 --> 01:28:08.561
you're whining,

2713
01:28:08.561 --> 01:28:09.460
you're expressing your,

2714
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:11.170
your fears for the future.

2715
01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:12.310
We have to create gods.

2716
01:28:12.311 --> 01:28:14.620
You have to create the reason why the lightning comes down.

2717
01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:14.980
I mean,

2718
01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.410
things like exponentially changed.

2719
01:28:17.411 --> 01:28:20.650
It wasn't like all the sudden human beings were different.

2720
01:28:20.651 --> 01:28:20.771
No,

2721
01:28:20.771 --> 01:28:21.940
human beings are the same,

2722
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.990
but now all this new information is coming in and as they're developing this

2723
01:28:25.991 --> 01:28:26.980
thing called language,

2724
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:31.690
I think we're at a very similar place right now and the changes between us of

2725
01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:34.330
today and what we will be a thousand years from now,

2726
01:28:34.331 --> 01:28:38.860
we'll probably just as radical as it changes of nonspeaking hominids to speaking

2727
01:28:38.861 --> 01:28:39.694
hominids.

2728
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.660
<v 4>Well that's a very interesting and uh,</v>

2729
01:28:42.661 --> 01:28:47.661
I grain have always just thought about what are the longterm effects of sort of

2730
01:28:50.861 --> 01:28:54.280
having everything at your fingertips constantly.

2731
01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.450
You know,

2732
01:28:55.450 --> 01:29:00.450
I always say when I grew up and I wanted to see the Grinch that stole Christmas,

2733
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.200
that came on ABC at eight o'clock on December 13th and you had to wait a,

2734
01:29:08.630 --> 01:29:10.590
you could not see it before then.

2735
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.311
And by the way,

2736
01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:12.720
he couldn't see it after then either.

2737
01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:13.440
If you were,

2738
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:13.950
you know,

2739
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:16.440
in the kitchen and the commercial break was over,

2740
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:17.550
you had to fucking sprint,

2741
01:29:17.551 --> 01:29:21.990
you're a little jammies with the feet built in and slide across the floor to see

2742
01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:22.590
it.

2743
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.420
And it was a kind of a foreplay.

2744
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.310
And now if my kids want to see the Grinch that stole Christmas,

2745
01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:32.260
they can see it in July on Blu Ray.

2746
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:34.110
But I don't think it means shit to them.

2747
01:29:34.190 --> 01:29:34.731
<v 0>Even better.</v>

2748
01:29:34.731 --> 01:29:38.870
They can see it on iTunes instantly on the iPad sitting in the living room be a

2749
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.510
bit,

2750
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:40.343
<v 4>yeah,</v>

2751
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.670
and it's playing or in the head rest of Mommy says,

2752
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.743
right.

2753
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:48.720
Are they happier because of that?

2754
01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:50.100
I don't think they are.

2755
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:51.690
If you would've asked me,

2756
01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:55.530
would you like to see the Grinch that stole Christmas whenever you wanted and

2757
01:29:55.531 --> 01:29:57.000
the head rest of Mommy's car?

2758
01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.380
I would have said yes,

2759
01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.420
but I don't think I would have been happier because all it does is speed you up,

2760
01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.730
changes your expectation level,

2761
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:09.840
and then every once in a blue moon when you don't get to see whatever it is you

2762
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:12.060
want to see exactly the same time,

2763
01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:15.090
I mean you then you're pissed off.

2764
01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:15.930
Yeah.

2765
01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:16.231
And,

2766
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:16.831
and I,

2767
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:17.071
you know,

2768
01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:20.790
my kids are probably going to be walking around at age 25 going,

2769
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:21.601
hey man,

2770
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:25.110
I want to see fast and furious one 29 and someone's going to go,

2771
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:25.891
well,

2772
01:30:25.891 --> 01:30:27.360
it doesn't come out for four months.

2773
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.050
Oh,

2774
01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:29.460
that's such bullshit.

2775
01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:31.140
Fucking go get it.

2776
01:30:31.141 --> 01:30:33.150
Well Gia and put it in my box.

2777
01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:35.850
I want to watch it on my phone and they're going in my head.

2778
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.760
Well watching my head,

2779
01:30:36.761 --> 01:30:38.430
I just want to close my eyes and they go,

2780
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.570
it's not done.

2781
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.830
Fuck that.

2782
01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:42.000
This is such bullshit.

2783
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:44.430
<v 0>Have you seen this new store that came out today?</v>

2784
01:30:44.431 --> 01:30:49.080
The picture that Jamie put up earlier that by 2030 there and I have mind a mind

2785
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:50.550
thought toss talking.

2786
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:51.703
<v 4>Wow,</v>

2787
01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.371
<v 0>mine too.</v>

2788
01:30:52.371 --> 01:30:55.100
And that this is something that I've been bringing it up for a while,

2789
01:30:55.101 --> 01:30:59.420
that I think that human beings like the interface of sounds like using sounds

2790
01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:02.390
and even using language is a temporary thing.

2791
01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:04.850
I think that there's gonna come a point in time where you're going to be able to

2792
01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:06.410
read like intent.

2793
01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:07.221
You're going to be able to,

2794
01:31:07.221 --> 01:31:10.280
I might not be able to understand what's going on in your head the same way you,

2795
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:11.750
when you have thoughts in your head,

2796
01:31:11.751 --> 01:31:12.890
when you have ideas,

2797
01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:15.770
you're not doing it with a language you're not.

2798
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.440
You're not expressing your thoughts to yourself with a language.

2799
01:31:18.441 --> 01:31:20.210
Very rarely do I say,

2800
01:31:20.211 --> 01:31:21.044
well,

2801
01:31:21.170 --> 01:31:24.680
it's about time to pull yourself by your bootstraps and get back to work.

2802
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:29.660
I just have a feeling in my head that represents those words and I've had that

2803
01:31:29.661 --> 01:31:34.100
exact same thing happened to me during like heavy duty psychedelic experiences.

2804
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:39.250
I've had something relay information to me in the form of intent instead of in

2805
01:31:39.471 --> 01:31:40.190
words.

2806
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:43.790
I think that ultimately like in having experienced it in a psychedelic state

2807
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:44.360
like,

2808
01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:44.691
uh,

2809
01:31:44.691 --> 01:31:46.790
on dimethyltryptamine or on mushrooms,

2810
01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:51.290
I think that's probably what you would experience when they figure out this sort

2811
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:52.124
of technology.

2812
01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:56.030
Like I'll be able to read your intent and it will be free of language.

2813
01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.290
Like you're just signals that are going on inside your mind.

2814
01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:00.100
You'll be able to

2815
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.480
<v 1>distribute those to other people.</v>

2816
01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:02.311
<v 4>All right,</v>

2817
01:32:02.311 --> 01:32:03.091
so you do,

2818
01:32:03.091 --> 01:32:03.361
you know,

2819
01:32:03.361 --> 01:32:04.580
I have to piss really good.

2820
01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.530
Go ahead and pass mic.

2821
01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:06.240
I'm kidding.

2822
01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:06.660
No,

2823
01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:06.871
I,

2824
01:32:06.871 --> 01:32:07.081
it's,

2825
01:32:07.081 --> 01:32:07.830
it's already,

2826
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:12.830
it's already incredibly interesting to me that you can take amputees that are

2827
01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.960
cut off at the elbow strap on,

2828
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:16.590
uh,

2829
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.860
you know,

2830
01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.540
robotic prosthetic,

2831
01:32:18.541 --> 01:32:19.320
whatever,

2832
01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.980
and their brain is able to tell it,

2833
01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:23.491
you know,

2834
01:32:23.491 --> 01:32:24.660
to pick up,

2835
01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.370
uh,

2836
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.870
uh,

2837
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:30.870
a grape lightly enough not to squash it or pick up a pencil hard enough to hold

2838
01:32:31.651 --> 01:32:36.651
it in their hand and which fingers and digits to move just from the brain to a

2839
01:32:37.681 --> 01:32:41.820
severed limb and get that thing to function.

2840
01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:42.540
I mean,

2841
01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:47.540
obviously that's your brain communicating with something without language.

2842
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:53.450
And to me the leap between making your brain communicate with animatronic digits

2843
01:32:58.201 --> 01:33:02.910
that are moving around and unscrewing Manet's jars are picking up pencils or

2844
01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:03.780
holding your child.

2845
01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:09.230
That's not a very big leap to get from moving that hand around using your

2846
01:33:09.391 --> 01:33:12.900
thought versus communicating that way.

2847
01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:13.331
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2848
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:13.541
no,

2849
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:14.051
I agree.

2850
01:33:14.051 --> 01:33:14.201
I,

2851
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:16.060
I think it's just a matter of time.

2852
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:18.970
Like this thing says 2030 that sounds totally normal to me.

2853
01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.970
I mean especially when you consider the exponential pace at the things

2854
01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:22.893
improving.

2855
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.760
I was a at a company in San Francisco for a,

2856
01:33:25.761 --> 01:33:30.160
the Scifi show that I did where we put on these head gear and you control a

2857
01:33:30.161 --> 01:33:33.280
remote controlled helicopter with your mind,

2858
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.331
with your thoughts,

2859
01:33:34.331 --> 01:33:35.800
like your intent moves.

2860
01:33:35.801 --> 01:33:39.370
This thing I was able to like have it hover in the air for a little bit,

2861
01:33:39.371 --> 01:33:41.110
but apparently once you get good at it,

2862
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:44.020
you can actually move it down the hallway and park it someplace.

2863
01:33:44.021 --> 01:33:44.980
And I mean it's,

2864
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:45.970
it's fucking bananas.

2865
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:46.181
You're,

2866
01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:51.181
you're piloting a really crude remote control vehicle with your thoughts.

2867
01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:52.030
Right.

2868
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:55.300
And this is a matter of time before they figure out how you're going to have

2869
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:57.010
fucking robots flying around your house,

2870
01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:58.120
fetching new coffee.

2871
01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.160
You're going to look at your robot,

2872
01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:03.460
your little flying fucking helicopter robot coffee maker,

2873
01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:04.271
and you're going to say,

2874
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:05.081
go make me some coffee,

2875
01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:08.620
stupid and it's going to fly off and make you coffee and come back and give it

2876
01:34:08.621 --> 01:34:10.870
to you and you're able to do all this with your mind.

2877
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:11.700
And I've got to say it,

2878
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:11.990
you know,

2879
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.823
just do it.

2880
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.420
Yeah,

2881
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:13.900
yeah.

2882
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.111
No,

2883
01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:15.910
I mean the drones are already stepping up.

2884
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.570
It's a lot of it is computers versus batteries.

2885
01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:19.931
You know,

2886
01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:23.290
it's the batteries that were bricks,

2887
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.950
um,

2888
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:25.330
just 10 years ago,

2889
01:34:25.331 --> 01:34:30.331
I mean batteries were just huge bricks and now they're the size of corridors and

2890
01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:35.770
they're producing the same power because all this stuff needs to be propelled by

2891
01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:36.281
something.

2892
01:34:36.281 --> 01:34:36.461
You know,

2893
01:34:36.461 --> 01:34:37.294
there needs to be

2894
01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.700
<v 4>system that powers it up.</v>

2895
01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:40.803
And I know,

2896
01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.170
even though it sounds corny way,

2897
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:47.890
I used to fly remote control airplanes and they had electric ones.

2898
01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:52.891
And the problem with the electric ones is the battery was literally a brick and

2899
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:57.010
it's hard to fly a little styrofoam playing with a brick,

2900
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:57.950
the middle of it.

2901
01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:02.950
And now most all of them are electric just because of the cell phone technology

2902
01:35:03.051 --> 01:35:04.910
and the battery that has been shrunk,

2903
01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.470
enlightened to the point where it's,

2904
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:07.520
it's nothing anymore.

2905
01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:07.951
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2906
01:35:07.951 --> 01:35:10.060
it's amazing what they can do too with the,

2907
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.190
the algorithms that they have and they're in their operating system for power

2908
01:35:14.191 --> 01:35:14.761
management.

2909
01:35:14.761 --> 01:35:18.750
Like you could take an iPad and you can watch five fucking movies on a flight

2910
01:35:18.751 --> 01:35:19.950
and it doesn't run out of juice.

2911
01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:20.400
Right?

2912
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.840
You're watching a fairly big screen and all these images are being processed.

2913
01:35:24.841 --> 01:35:25.920
It's constantly moving around.

2914
01:35:25.921 --> 01:35:29.340
You Watch a whole fucking movie and then you look at your battery and it's like

2915
01:35:29.341 --> 01:35:30.330
barely budged.

2916
01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:31.830
Well,

2917
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:32.410
because

2918
01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:34.090
<v 4>nothing there,</v>

2919
01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:34.720
there's,

2920
01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.460
there are no more moving parts.

2921
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.271
I mean,

2922
01:35:37.271 --> 01:35:42.271
there used to be conveyor belts and they're powered by rivers with wheels in

2923
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:47.410
them and that took a lot of energy and now everything is digital and there's no

2924
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:49.721
parts,

2925
01:35:49.721 --> 01:35:51.100
there's no friction.

2926
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:51.971
There's no,

2927
01:35:51.971 --> 01:35:52.331
you know,

2928
01:35:52.331 --> 01:35:54.160
you don't realize,

2929
01:35:54.161 --> 01:35:56.050
well you probably realize,

2930
01:35:56.051 --> 01:36:00.160
but you know whenever you talk about a car and you talked about horsepower,

2931
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:00.791
you go,

2932
01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:05.791
how much is it making to the crank and the guy goes 500 horsepower and then you

2933
01:36:05.921 --> 01:36:06.191
go,

2934
01:36:06.191 --> 01:36:08.020
what's it make into the rear wheels?

2935
01:36:08.021 --> 01:36:08.351
And you go,

2936
01:36:08.351 --> 01:36:11.680
well let's make it about (430) 420-5430 right?

2937
01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:11.951
All right,

2938
01:36:11.951 --> 01:36:12.784
that's not bad.

2939
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:13.271
Good.

2940
01:36:13.271 --> 01:36:17.470
May we get some synthetic oil and that rear end and get it up to four 31 or

2941
01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:18.304
whatever it is.

2942
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:23.430
But you are scrubbing off all of that inertia and all of that torque and power

2943
01:36:24.521 --> 01:36:29.110
because it's having to pass through drive shafts and transmissions and

2944
01:36:29.111 --> 01:36:32.200
differentials and it's scrubbing it off.

2945
01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:34.300
But if all that was digital,

2946
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:39.070
then you'd have 500 horsepower at the crank and 500 it's a rear wheel.

2947
01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:40.870
And that's what we're getting now.

2948
01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:41.940
That digital,

2949
01:36:42.210 --> 01:36:43.860
<v 0>is that what they get with like Tesla's,</v>

2950
01:36:43.861 --> 01:36:44.694
are they like,

2951
01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:45.810
is there a,

2952
01:36:45.811 --> 01:36:47.730
is there horsepower at the engine?

2953
01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.870
The same as at the wheel?

2954
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.651
Well,

2955
01:36:49.651 --> 01:36:49.950
what,

2956
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:50.550
what,

2957
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:54.960
<v 4>what they're getting and what they're doing now is it's all about torque and</v>

2958
01:36:54.961 --> 01:36:57.450
it's instant torque with electric motors.

2959
01:36:57.451 --> 01:36:58.650
So they're getting that big,

2960
01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:04.070
that's why the Tesla zero to 60 is not much off of,

2961
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.710
if not the same as your Porsche.

2962
01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.860
Now your top speed and your poor shows faster,

2963
01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:12.600
but the zero to 60,

2964
01:37:12.810 --> 01:37:14.910
it's that kind of golf cart kind of thing.

2965
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.330
Again,

2966
01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:16.650
a golf cart and the guy hits it,

2967
01:37:16.651 --> 01:37:17.910
she'll flying off the back.

2968
01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:18.181
Yeah.

2969
01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:18.451
I mean,

2970
01:37:18.451 --> 01:37:23.451
imagine a real car with four motors on all four wheels so you get the instant

2971
01:37:25.801 --> 01:37:27.390
torque immediately.

2972
01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.770
But secondly,

2973
01:37:28.771 --> 01:37:29.151
and I,

2974
01:37:29.151 --> 01:37:31.440
I've not studied to Tesla that closely,

2975
01:37:31.441 --> 01:37:34.350
but the motor is connected to the wheel.

2976
01:37:34.351 --> 01:37:38.670
There's no transmission that it's passing through propeller shaft and

2977
01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:42.650
differentials and things that are scrubbing off inertia.

2978
01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.000
<v 0>Who you fucked with those at all?</v>

2979
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:44.700
Teslas.

2980
01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:44.990
I,

2981
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:46.360
I've drove a,

2982
01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:49.130
I just drove one around once and it's there quick.

2983
01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:49.721
I mean,

2984
01:37:49.721 --> 01:37:50.720
they're super quick.

2985
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:51.261
They're really,

2986
01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:51.500
uh,

2987
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.740
my friend Aubrey has one and they have a laptop in the middle of it,

2988
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.080
like essentially like

2989
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:56.581
<v 1>it's huge.</v>

2990
01:37:56.581 --> 01:37:57.414
And he goes,

2991
01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:57.691
uh,

2992
01:37:57.691 --> 01:37:58.680
we were going to the gym.

2993
01:37:58.681 --> 01:37:59.080
He goes,

2994
01:37:59.080 --> 01:37:59.551
he said,

2995
01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:00.181
the name of the gym,

2996
01:38:00.181 --> 01:38:02.540
navigate to [inaudible] and it just takes you there.

2997
01:38:02.541 --> 01:38:02.821
And I'm like,

2998
01:38:02.821 --> 01:38:03.840
this is fucking insane.

2999
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.631
I get it.

3000
01:38:04.631 --> 01:38:06.300
It finds it on Google maps,

3001
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:07.260
gives you the option,

3002
01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:11.010
you press a button and this huge navigation screen when you wanted to listen to

3003
01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:11.461
music,

3004
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:12.240
he's like,

3005
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:12.930
um,

3006
01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:14.370
play the doors.

3007
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.530
So all of a sudden it,

3008
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:19.680
Spotify pulls up all these options for the doors break on through to the other

3009
01:38:19.681 --> 01:38:20.250
side,

3010
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:21.270
plus plus that one,

3011
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:21.601
boom.

3012
01:38:21.601 --> 01:38:25.180
And it starts playing and it gets it all through the actual computer itself on

3013
01:38:25.181 --> 01:38:25.350
the,

3014
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.670
on the,

3015
01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:26.503
on the car,

3016
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.900
not even connected to your phone.

3017
01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:32.640
It's a completely independent all it uses some sort of unfortunately three g not

3018
01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:34.020
four g connection.

3019
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:34.920
Yeah.

3020
01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.150
It's unbelievable.

3021
01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.113
Um,

3022
01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:40.050
this is going to be a rough transition,

3023
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.080
but seeing as how I have to go do my podcast pretty quick on the topic of

3024
01:38:45.361 --> 01:38:46.230
podcasts,

3025
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:46.591
you know,

3026
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:47.580
I'm being sued.

3027
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:48.563
Yes.

3028
01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:49.770
And uh,

3029
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.800
explain that to people because it's one of the dumbest fucking lawsuits I've

3030
01:38:52.801 --> 01:38:53.640
ever heard in my life.

3031
01:38:53.641 --> 01:38:57.690
But there's people that make a living off of these types of lawsuits right

3032
01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.020
there.

3033
01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:58.500
Yeah.

3034
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.120
Called Patent trolls that buy up patents and their lawyers.

3035
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.590
And it's Sorta,

3036
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.720
I think it's this country at its worse.

3037
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:07.710
I really do.

3038
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:12.711
It's they buy patents and then they shoe companies saying they're using stealing

3039
01:39:13.831 --> 01:39:16.230
or unlawfully using their technology.

3040
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:18.870
And sometimes when you're buying technology,

3041
01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:20.400
there's a real good argument to that.

3042
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:24.270
Like that technology is a part of this thing that you're selling.

3043
01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:25.560
And without that technology,

3044
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:26.610
which is patented,

3045
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.050
your technology,

3046
01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.090
what you're selling would not exist.

3047
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.690
Right.

3048
01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:35.690
And I get that part and I support innovation and people should be paid for for

3049
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.710
intellectual property and creative ideas.

3050
01:39:37.711 --> 01:39:39.390
But this is a weird one.

3051
01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:40.021
This is,

3052
01:39:40.021 --> 01:39:42.450
what is the exact term that,

3053
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.480
that they have a patent on the exact cause they have a patent on a playlist.

3054
01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:49.800
Yes.

3055
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.633
So online,

3056
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.930
anything in a serial order.

3057
01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:52.200
Right,

3058
01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:52.880
right.

3059
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.940
Even blogs,

3060
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:59.270
I evidently anything that's comes out on a Monday and then the next one comes

3061
01:40:00.271 --> 01:40:04.950
out on a Tuesday or this song is above that song and this song is number three

3062
01:40:04.951 --> 01:40:06.120
and that song's number seven.

3063
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:08.970
That's what they claim to have dementia.

3064
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:09.181
No,

3065
01:40:09.181 --> 01:40:09.461
first,

3066
01:40:09.461 --> 01:40:13.140
so if you have a blog and you enter into the blog,

3067
01:40:13.141 --> 01:40:15.390
like a blog entry number one,

3068
01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:18.930
you know a Adam goes to do podcasts to talk about this lawsuit.

3069
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.940
They could sue you for that.

3070
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:22.590
Like they own a piece of that,

3071
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:25.770
a serialized message that you're putting on a website.

3072
01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:26.191
Yeah.

3073
01:40:26.191 --> 01:40:28.620
Numbered message that that's correct.

3074
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:29.490
That's insane.

3075
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:30.121
Well,

3076
01:40:30.121 --> 01:40:32.760
this insane because if it's true,

3077
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:35.960
then really everything on the Internet's got it.

3078
01:40:35.961 --> 01:40:36.480
Go Away.

3079
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:36.991
Everything.

3080
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:40.470
Could you imagine if they bought up everything on the Internet with one sneaky

3081
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:41.304
move,

3082
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:42.660
like one sneaky move,

3083
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:43.950
one pan with the judge says,

3084
01:40:43.951 --> 01:40:44.161
look,

3085
01:40:44.161 --> 01:40:44.911
the guy's got a point.

3086
01:40:44.911 --> 01:40:47.100
He owns a everything in serialized form.

3087
01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:47.700
Well,

3088
01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:48.391
the price number,

3089
01:40:48.391 --> 01:40:51.900
the problem is is I don't think the judge or the jury is going to think they

3090
01:40:51.901 --> 01:40:52.734
have a point.

3091
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.370
Unfortunately,

3092
01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.850
<v 4>in order to make our point that they don't have a point,</v>

3093
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:00.070
it's going to cost one point $5 million.

3094
01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:02.000
<v 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3095
01:41:03.650 --> 01:41:04.970
Holy Shit.

3096
01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:08.600
That's what patent litigation costs.

3097
01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:10.220
That's what the legal fees are going to be.

3098
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:11.060
That's what,

3099
01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.860
that's what I've been quoted.

3100
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:14.060
Oh my God,

3101
01:41:14.061 --> 01:41:19.061
I've been quoted 1.25 to 1.5 wow.

3102
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:20.450
Yeah,

3103
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:21.171
that's stunning.

3104
01:41:21.171 --> 01:41:22.640
I never would have thought it would be that high.

3105
01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.920
So are they offering hade a lot?

3106
01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:25.410
So there's a,

3107
01:41:25.410 --> 01:41:26.121
is that what it is?

3108
01:41:26.121 --> 01:41:27.050
It's all the lawyers.

3109
01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:27.351
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3110
01:41:27.351 --> 01:41:28.370
That's what it is.

3111
01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.920
It's all the lawyers and that.

3112
01:41:30.921 --> 01:41:32.510
How much work did they have to do here,

3113
01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:34.543
Joe?

3114
01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.730
For me it's like first off,

3115
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:41.600
I spent $50,000 trying to get a change of fucking venue.

3116
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:43.910
These guys are in eastern Texas.

3117
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:45.890
That's where they set up

3118
01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:51.260
<v 1>because eastern Texas is famous for friendly to their types of folk.</v>

3119
01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:52.920
Yeah.

3120
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.090
To this type of thing.

3121
01:41:54.091 --> 01:41:55.500
Patent troll lawsuits.

3122
01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.640
<v 4>I don't live in eastern Texas and my business isn't in eastern Texas and they</v>

3123
01:42:01.341 --> 01:42:03.290
don't live in eastern Texas either.

3124
01:42:03.291 --> 01:42:05.180
That's just where they hung their shingle

3125
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:08.710
<v 1>and they hung their shingle specifically because this is a place it's</v>

3126
01:42:08.711 --> 01:42:10.510
advantageous to do things like this.

3127
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.713
<v 4>Well,</v>

3128
01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:16.670
it's what you would do if you were company that bought up other people's

3129
01:42:16.671 --> 01:42:21.671
technology and then tried to sue other businesses and make money off of them.

3130
01:42:22.401 --> 01:42:24.390
You're going to maximize that,

3131
01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:29.300
the possibility of you getting an outcome that's in your favor and you'll do it

3132
01:42:29.301 --> 01:42:30.710
on the moon if you have to.

3133
01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:30.991
<v 1>Now,</v>

3134
01:42:30.991 --> 01:42:33.510
if these people come to you with some sort of a settlement,

3135
01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:34.651
like if they said,

3136
01:42:34.651 --> 01:42:35.041
hey,

3137
01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:35.281
you know,

3138
01:42:35.281 --> 01:42:36.600
you're using our technology,

3139
01:42:36.601 --> 01:42:37.980
we would like five bucks a month.

3140
01:42:37.981 --> 01:42:39.400
Like anything along those lines,

3141
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.190
$3 million.

3142
01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:42.780
Whoa.

3143
01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:44.941
And this,

3144
01:42:44.941 --> 01:42:45.774
because they've,

3145
01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.070
they've won these before,

3146
01:42:47.071 --> 01:42:47.881
the same company.

3147
01:42:47.881 --> 01:42:49.590
They got $8 million from apple,

3148
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.040
right?

3149
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.530
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3150
01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:50.820
It's,

3151
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.820
it's unclear what I'm doing with them and what they're doing with me.

3152
01:42:56.730 --> 01:42:59.130
But it's a pretty simple equation,

3153
01:42:59.131 --> 01:43:00.870
which is I just said,

3154
01:43:00.871 --> 01:43:01.141
look,

3155
01:43:01.141 --> 01:43:06.141
all the guys in podcasting need to kind of band together and we need to fight

3156
01:43:07.051 --> 01:43:08.970
them and then we need to beat them.

3157
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.560
And then once we beat them,

3158
01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:11.843
then their beat,

3159
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:17.330
cause they can't go after you or mark Marin or whoever once we beat them.

3160
01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:21.480
<v 1>But if we allow this to just go away,</v>

3161
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:22.920
it's not going to,

3162
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:23.461
if we say,

3163
01:43:23.461 --> 01:43:25.260
well let's just put it aside and you know,

3164
01:43:25.261 --> 01:43:26.220
fucking ignore them,

3165
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.233
then they win.

3166
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.810
I mean,

3167
01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:29.310
it's a possibility that they could win.

3168
01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:30.570
<v 4>There's no way.</v>

3169
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:31.411
Look,

3170
01:43:31.411 --> 01:43:32.400
when you get sued,

3171
01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:33.210
you get sued.

3172
01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:34.320
You're gonna to respond.

3173
01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:35.850
But you know,

3174
01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.140
let's just say,

3175
01:43:37.141 --> 01:43:37.681
we said,

3176
01:43:37.681 --> 01:43:38.100
look,

3177
01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:38.933
uh,

3178
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:42.510
you guys obviously haven't done the math on our company,

3179
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:44.190
but you know,

3180
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.420
it's,

3181
01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:46.470
it's a business.

3182
01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:51.620
No one wants to spend the time and the 1 million plus dollars to fight this

3183
01:43:52.431 --> 01:43:53.030
thing.

3184
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.863
You know,

3185
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:59.080
take 350 grand and please go away.

3186
01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.120
Or 500 grand or a hundred grand,

3187
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:03.140
whatever it is.

3188
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:04.251
Well,

3189
01:44:04.251 --> 01:44:08.240
how long before they go to iTunes and they go,

3190
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:08.580
Ooh,

3191
01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:12.450
let's see who else is doing okay over here on iTunes and they take a piece of

3192
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:14.570
this doing all right.

3193
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:15.081
Now,

3194
01:44:15.081 --> 01:44:17.060
last time we did this with Corolla,

3195
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:22.510
we got 500 k out of him when we chose good for and all we got to do is do the

3196
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:25.010
same thing we did with Corolla.

3197
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.113
He knows,

3198
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:27.200
I mean,

3199
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:27.770
we'll let,

3200
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:30.020
we'll let Joe's attorneys coach him up,

3201
01:44:30.021 --> 01:44:31.160
but they're going to tell you this,

3202
01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:33.260
the most expensive kind of litigation,

3203
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:35.300
it's going to cost over a million dollars.

3204
01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:37.070
I mean he can go on the Internet and look that up.

3205
01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:37.900
Know,

3206
01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:39.130
<v 0>and beings are behind this.</v>

3207
01:44:39.131 --> 01:44:40.420
Do you know the actual human beings?

3208
01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.393
<v 4>Uh,</v>

3209
01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.140
<v 0>are you aware of the names or faces?</v>

3210
01:44:43.141 --> 01:44:43.974
Do you know what they look like?

3211
01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:44.951
<v 4>No,</v>

3212
01:44:44.951 --> 01:44:47.770
I don't and I never think that way.

3213
01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.550
Like I,

3214
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:50.980
I just think the,

3215
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:57.090
I understand that we live in a world that is generally decent and that these

3216
01:44:58.181 --> 01:45:02.020
people probably think of themselves as generally decent.

3217
01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:02.741
You know,

3218
01:45:02.741 --> 01:45:05.350
they probably have kids that love them and a wife that,

3219
01:45:05.351 --> 01:45:06.000
uh,

3220
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.930
it gives him a blowjob on occasion.

3221
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.120
This is what they do for living.

3222
01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.220
This is their business.

3223
01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:17.700
And I think when a guy works at a used RV lot and he's got an Rv on that lot

3224
01:45:19.601 --> 01:45:23.830
that's worth $4,000 and some elderly couple comes in there and he gets them for

3225
01:45:23.831 --> 01:45:24.664
20 grand,

3226
01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.920
he doesn't go home and stare in the mirror and go,

3227
01:45:26.921 --> 01:45:27.580
wow,

3228
01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:28.990
I'm a really bad human being.

3229
01:45:29.290 --> 01:45:29.860
He goes,

3230
01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.420
I'm a fucking great salesman.

3231
01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.620
And I think that's what these guys do.

3232
01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:38.050
I don't even fault them.

3233
01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.270
And on a personal level,

3234
01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:44.500
like they make money from doing this.

3235
01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.300
I understand it.

3236
01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.230
Uh,

3237
01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:47.471
it's,

3238
01:45:47.471 --> 01:45:47.981
no,

3239
01:45:47.981 --> 01:45:52.330
it's not even worth trying to make it a personal issue.

3240
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:54.430
I don't feel it's a personal issue.

3241
01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.860
They saw my podcast,

3242
01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.410
I'm actually in a bizarre way,

3243
01:45:59.411 --> 01:46:00.244
flattered.

3244
01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.080
They saw my podcast and said,

3245
01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.210
that guy is really doing well for himself.

3246
01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:04.410
I,

3247
01:46:04.410 --> 01:46:06.520
let's go get 3 million bucks.

3248
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.880
That's insane that that was the first offering.

3249
01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.410
So it's stunning.

3250
01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.940
What we're doing is we're getting everyone together and we're going to show him

3251
01:46:15.941 --> 01:46:19.660
that the podcast community is a lot stronger than they thought,

3252
01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.790
that they fucked with the wrong people.

3253
01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.230
And I don't mean me,

3254
01:46:23.231 --> 01:46:28.231
I mean everybody and that whether you're a Joe Rogan fan or Adam Carolla fan or

3255
01:46:28.331 --> 01:46:29.500
an NPR fan,

3256
01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:34.420
it's all going away if we don't buck up and beat these guys.

3257
01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:39.421
So we just went to fund anything.com forward slash pan trawl and you can give

3258
01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.450
toward the legal defense fund.

3259
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:44.870
And that's video he's going,

3260
01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:45.090
there's

3261
01:46:45.090 --> 01:46:48.550
<v 0>a video up there to watch where Adam explains the whole situation,</v>

3262
01:46:49.150 --> 01:46:49.500
uh,

3263
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.620
what's going on and,

3264
01:46:50.621 --> 01:46:51.510
and spread this,

3265
01:46:51.511 --> 01:46:52.560
spread it on Twitter,

3266
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.180
spread it on Facebook.

3267
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:55.230
Let everybody know.

3268
01:46:55.231 --> 01:46:56.790
If you can't donate,

3269
01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:01.260
at least spread the word and let people know what the fuck is going on.

3270
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:01.981
Because,

3271
01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:02.400
uh,

3272
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:02.761
yeah,

3273
01:47:02.761 --> 01:47:03.960
this is a crazy thing.

3274
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.830
It's just a weird byproduct of our society,

3275
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:08.843
right?

3276
01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200
I don't like it,

3277
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:12.540
but there's nothing we can do about it at this point in time.

3278
01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.410
No,

3279
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:14.141
other than this,

3280
01:47:14.141 --> 01:47:14.974
that this,

3281
01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:20.710
<v 3>it's really cool because this could be a seminal moment for podcasting,</v>

3282
01:47:20.891 --> 01:47:23.020
which is you guys fucked with the wrong guys.

3283
01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.390
We're all grassroots,

3284
01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.720
but we all band together.

3285
01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:31.020
We all got our little individual little armies and we all got them United and we

3286
01:47:31.451 --> 01:47:33.220
all fought this common cause.

3287
01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:35.350
<v 0>You know what I love about podcasting?</v>

3288
01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.920
That I do think that that's something that fits with a,

3289
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:39.370
the ethic of podcasting.

3290
01:47:39.490 --> 01:47:41.890
But I also love that podcasting isn't,

3291
01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.930
it's not a competitive thing in that everybody supports everybody else in

3292
01:47:46.931 --> 01:47:47.764
podcasting.

3293
01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:52.450
I've never heard of podcast feuds like morning Dj guys always fucking hate the

3294
01:47:52.451 --> 01:47:53.620
other morning Dj Guy,

3295
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:54.040
right?

3296
01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.120
They always talk shit about him.

3297
01:47:55.121 --> 01:47:56.470
But podcasts,

3298
01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:56.771
I,

3299
01:47:56.771 --> 01:47:56.940
I've,

3300
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:59.530
I don't know anybody who says like,

3301
01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.251
you know,

3302
01:48:00.251 --> 01:48:00.451
uh,

3303
01:48:00.451 --> 01:48:03.520
we would be fucking doing great if it wasn't for that Adam Carolla show.

3304
01:48:03.521 --> 01:48:08.170
Everybody's watching that stupid shows sucks our podcasts is the future that

3305
01:48:08.171 --> 01:48:09.950
shows for old people fuck up.

3306
01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:10.450
You know,

3307
01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:11.020
that doesn't,

3308
01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.640
it doesn't seem to be going on at all.

3309
01:48:12.730 --> 01:48:13.980
I think the Internet has,

3310
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:17.650
the attitude of the Internet is that when you're dealing with the world,

3311
01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.480
you're dealing with an infinite amount of people.

3312
01:48:19.481 --> 01:48:24.481
It's so goddamn big that having that sort of famine mentality that a lot of

3313
01:48:24.911 --> 01:48:25.930
people have,

3314
01:48:25.931 --> 01:48:28.510
if they are in morning radio in a specific city,

3315
01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.400
you don't need it in the Internet.

3316
01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:30.780
<v 3>No,</v>

3317
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:32.130
I listen to every,

3318
01:48:32.150 --> 01:48:33.470
I feel like,

3319
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:34.363
uh,

3320
01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:36.073
you know,

3321
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.840
the last podcast I did yesterday,

3322
01:48:38.841 --> 01:48:43.841
Jane Moore and Jo Koy were both guests on the show and they both have podcasts

3323
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:50.270
and 80% of the guests on my show have their own podcast and we promote their

3324
01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:54.080
podcasts on my podcast.

3325
01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:54.470
Yes.

3326
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:56.150
So that's all you need to know,

3327
01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:56.820
right?

3328
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.980
<v 0>Do the exact same thing.</v>

3329
01:48:57.981 --> 01:48:59.270
And I'm always telling people,

3330
01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.590
you should do a podcast,

3331
01:49:00.591 --> 01:49:01.910
like people that have good guests.

3332
01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:02.390
I'm like,

3333
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:04.100
why don't you do your own podcast all,

3334
01:49:04.101 --> 01:49:05.660
you don't even need a place like this.

3335
01:49:05.661 --> 01:49:06.530
He need a fucking MP,

3336
01:49:06.531 --> 01:49:07.730
three recorder and the microphone,

3337
01:49:07.731 --> 01:49:08.564
that's it.

3338
01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:09.800
Upload it online.

3339
01:49:09.801 --> 01:49:11.480
It takes 10 seconds and boom,

3340
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:12.860
you have a fucking podcast.

3341
01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:13.540
Well,

3342
01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.720
<v 3>plan and is podcasters unite?</v>

3343
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.100
Rally your army.

3344
01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.150
And let's beat this.

3345
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:19.931
<v 0>Let's do it.</v>

3346
01:49:19.931 --> 01:49:20.411
We're in.

3347
01:49:20.411 --> 01:49:23.080
We're in 1000% that's not even a real number.

3348
01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:24.820
It's only a hundred percent is possible.

3349
01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:25.840
I had a liner in that,

3350
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:26.521
but we'll say it.

3351
01:49:26.521 --> 01:49:27.940
That was like your hyperbole.

3352
01:49:27.970 --> 01:49:29.050
I liked that you liked it.

3353
01:49:29.051 --> 01:49:29.591
So fun.

3354
01:49:29.591 --> 01:49:32.590

3358
01:49:39.821 --> 01:49:41.320
And that can donate.

3359
01:49:41.321 --> 01:49:41.771
I get it.

3360
01:49:41.771 --> 01:49:42.311
If you're broke,

3361
01:49:42.311 --> 01:49:43.300
I totally understand it.

3362
01:49:43.301 --> 01:49:44.134
But if you do,

3363
01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:44.681
uh,

3364
01:49:44.681 --> 01:49:49.570
appreciate podcasting and you do Adam's show and his network and he's got a

3365
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:50.404
whole network.

3366
01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:51.610
And then on top of that,

3367
01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.770
everybody else that you know that does podcasts,

3368
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:56.950
whether it's Joey [inaudible] or Duncan Trussell Adams,

3369
01:49:56.951 --> 01:49:57.251
right.

3370
01:49:57.251 --> 01:50:00.190
That would all go away if it wasn't for,

3371
01:50:00.210 --> 01:50:00.630
uh,

3372
01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:01.301
if you know,

3373
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:03.220
if we can't figure out a way around this issue,

3374
01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.780
absolutely do it.

3375
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:05.110
Do it.

3376
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:05.800
Ladies and gentlemen,

3377
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.190
Adam,

3378
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:09.100
I just want to tell you that you are one of the reasons why I did this in the

3379
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:09.880
first place.

3380
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.120
I loved watching you do it and go from regular radio.

3381
01:50:13.121 --> 01:50:16.330
And I remember doing the first ones when it was on the couch and you had the

3382
01:50:16.331 --> 01:50:18.510
clip on microphones and the whole deal.

3383
01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:19.090
I was like,

3384
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:19.451
wow,

3385
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:21.040
he's got kind of a cool setup here.

3386
01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:25.180
And that was part of what spun the wheels for me to get into this.

3387
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:26.860
And the first person you were podcasting,

3388
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:27.550
what time,

3389
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:28.390
what year did you start?

3390
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.360
The beginning of oh nine wasn't really.

3391
01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:32.313
Yeah.

3392
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:32.891
Yeah.

3393
01:50:32.891 --> 01:50:35.620
So I was around slightly after you,

3394
01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:36.580
slightly after you,

3395
01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:37.690
but you're a,

3396
01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:38.531
I listen,

3397
01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:42.010
I'm flattered and even come on out and see the new digs whenever,

3398
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:42.821
whenever you're like,

3399
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:42.931
well,

3400
01:50:42.931 --> 01:50:44.560
how do you change anything?

3401
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:45.560
Or you even bigger,

3402
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:46.230
better now.

3403
01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:48.070
I always working on the studio,

3404
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:51.280
always trying to improve and always trying to kind of build the business,

3405
01:50:51.281 --> 01:50:51.910
you know?

3406
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:52.330
Well,

3407
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:52.840
um,

3408
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:53.471
it's a,

3409
01:50:53.471 --> 01:50:54.281
it's very cool.

3410
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:55.630
It's very cool that it's working.

3411
01:50:55.631 --> 01:50:57.460
It's very cool to be a part of all this.

3412
01:50:57.461 --> 01:50:58.060
It's a,

3413
01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.930
the podcast and community is a great supportive community.

3414
01:51:01.931 --> 01:51:02.271
And what,

3415
01:51:02.271 --> 01:51:03.011
what you were talking about,

3416
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:05.080
about having people on your show that you know,

3417
01:51:05.081 --> 01:51:07.540
that have their own podcast and promoting their podcasts.

3418
01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:10.570
I think that's one of the coolest things about this business really is.

3419
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:11.141
Thanks John.

3420
01:51:11.141 --> 01:51:11.940
