33
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what he was working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy just got just totally </v>

<v Speaker 1>His fucking ears have gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His eyelids are gone.</v>

37
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just became a monster but survived.</v>

38
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.873
<v Speaker 1>And I'll never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget him telling me about </v>

39
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from that moment on,</v>

40
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.494
<v Speaker 1>from when I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been fucking terrified of </v>

41
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:34.524
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>

42
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't see it and shit.</v>

43
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a box,</v>

44
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the walls of this box is this </v>

45
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking invisible thing that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick a fork in there,</v>

46
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>it'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just blow your fucking brains out.</v>

47
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually does.</v>

48
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fail safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

49
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>If you stick a fork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get a horrible jolt.</v>

50
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what isn't that?</v>

51
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternating current and direct current,</v>

52
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

53
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>If I knew that answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be afraid of it.</v>

54
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently in England they have a far </v>

55
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>higher level of electricity that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through their walls.</v>

56
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the shit when you go over the </v>

57
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>special adapt as it just kills every </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

58
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>We let this two people live in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stick a fork in the wallet,</v>

59
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>good finds your whole family kills them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be super powerful.</v>

60
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I was changing the filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a generator,</v>

61
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.183
<v Speaker 1>a generator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it runs on natural gas and </v>

62
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.693
<v Speaker 1>because the winter comes one winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live at the end of a dirt road in the </v>

64
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when when the power goes out,</v>

65
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>mind use the first house to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it kicks right.</v>

66
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.714
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing I ever did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm out there like fucking changing </v>

67
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.653
<v Speaker 1>the filter on and then all the sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look over and his little instructions </v>

68
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.534
<v Speaker 1>like on the inside of the door saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to disconnect the battery when </v>

69
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we went down and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got like a can of coke in my hand.</v>

70
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I can see what a screwdriver in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

71
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I am frightened that I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Colorado.</v>

72
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>We had one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was running on propane,</v>

73
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>so when the power would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

74
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.543
<v Speaker 1>The power would go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to click and then you would hear </v>

75
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>it immediately and one second and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>let them.</v>

76
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.483
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the guy that told me the house </v>

77
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>told me to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like a small one.</v>

78
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said you should get her,</v>

79
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does yours run on propane?</v>

80
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 250 gallons that last a long time </v>

81
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
<v Speaker 1>to write 250 gallons of Iran for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had last year we had a storm and the </v>

82
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.183
<v Speaker 1>power went out and ran for two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half days and it only moved the needle </v>

83
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

84
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>this is the fucking balls man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

85
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of crazy how little it uses.</v>

86
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.643
<v Speaker 1>When I'm that big storm hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that like a year or two years ago </v>

88
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.360
<v Speaker 1>with the one where there was no food and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to Dunkin donuts and up</v>

89
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>all the songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing there.</v>

90
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It just goes to show you how God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile.</v>

91
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.363
<v Speaker 1>Our whole structure is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this false sense of security </v>

92
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>that much more so over there than over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

93
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Over here at least it doesn't get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over there,</v>

94
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get trapped in snow's,</v>

95
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just got back from New York.</v>

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.543
<v Speaker 1>I was on the tarmac yesterday and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a d ice and then we apparently sat </v>

119
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>on the runway too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to go back and dis again.</v>

120
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.083
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complainant used to take six months to </v>

121
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 1>go over here on a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

122
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still fucking aggravating,</v>

123
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean is to ride horses.</v>

124
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.363
<v Speaker 1>They used to take a horse with a wooden </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeled fucking sled behind it and you </v>

125
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.204
<v Speaker 1>should know that and your baby would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the sled with your wife and everyone </v>

126
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.080
<v Speaker 1>would be scared of Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still do that and tells us.</v>

127
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

128
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.353
<v Speaker 1>I actually.</v>

<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

132
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.350

<v Speaker 1>He's made it impossible.</v>

133
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.553
<v Speaker 1>There's bike lanes on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skateboard lanes is lanes for old </v>

<v Speaker 1>The city doesn't work.</v>

137
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Change the lanes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a totally different </v>

146
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>opinion of the flyover states now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's president.</v>

147
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.133
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I always liked them.</v>

150
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exactly right.</v>

151
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several different work.</v>

152
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are paying attention to in Ohio.</v>

153
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

154
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>that was a really good point that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people had when trump got elected was</v>

155
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.194
<v Speaker 2>that all these people that live in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>predominantly liberal areas like </v>

156
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

157
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City in California,</v>

158
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

159
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>trump is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

160
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 2>trump is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd love Hillary.</v>

161
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>We're so excited to have our first </v>
<v Speaker 2>female president.</v>

162
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent.</v>

163
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:41.954
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know anybody that's voting for </v>

164
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

165
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.283
<v Speaker 2>Because they're so insulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally don't know any </v>

166
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:47.894
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were convinced that she was </v>

167
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.564
<v Speaker 2>getting exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take out La county in New York </v>

168
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.570
<v Speaker 2>City that like he would have won the </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular vote to just to kind of,</v>

169
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.473
<v Speaker 2>not even the whole state of California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just La County and like a couple of </v>

170
00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>bottles of New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would've won the popular,</v>

171
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.233
<v Speaker 2>but you're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a bubble and what's crazy is </v>

172
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.424
<v Speaker 2>like he's not a good candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he's like the perfect </v>

173
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Republican and he's not like Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 2>character directly.</v>

174
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:14.354
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come upstanding guy who just looked at </v>

175
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.911
<v Speaker 2>him and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

176
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a precedent right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

177
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of refreshing.</v>

178
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it.</v>

179
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody for the last 30 years.</v>

180
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you guys know about right wingers.</v>

181
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure your fans are like this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I am a Centrus,</v>

185
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.513
<v Speaker 2>but people in show business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lean right on two issues that </v>

186
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:39.870
<v Speaker 2>have 400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking Nazi.</v>

187
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Had been called a right winger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not perfect.</v>

190
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.544
<v Speaker 2>You're like fucking Jerry Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he was what he was saying when he </v>

191
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 2>was saying crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

192
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor.</v>

193
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Nobody even notices the California </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even need a governor.</v>

194
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Like if he'd died and no one said </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

195
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:58.611
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's Jerry?</v>

196

<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

198
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't show up much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just pops up every once in a while.</v>

199

<v Speaker 2>state and he's 71.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

201
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.283

233
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>which he was sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had her on the podcast.</v>

234
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the major she's.</v>

235
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 2>She's a ballsy lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a little animal.</v>

237
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.663
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting that she was a </v>

238
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.234
<v Speaker 2>scientologist for whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost goes contrary to like how she </v>

239
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:45.924
<v Speaker 2>called bullshit on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how the hell did you not call </v>

240
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 2>bullshit on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

241
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 2>That's my first question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I watch that stuff,</v>

242
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.733
<v Speaker 2>I go rally into some office in La and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking they gave us some pamphlets and </v>

243
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:57.451
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

244
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 2>we can put these on fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is Catholicism any less ridiculous.</v>

245
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in that shit.</v>

246
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.150
<v Speaker 2>And I was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

247
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.083
<v Speaker 2>I was forced to go to church about </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh grade and I used to start </v>

248
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 2>wrestling my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

249
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 2>breaking shit on Sunday and he wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious man.</v>

250
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 2>He was laying in his bed and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to church with your mother.</v>

251
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a right in having a left.</v>

252
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I think as soon as you have two sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people can pick.</v>

253
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>People just get on one side and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dig their heels in.</v>

254
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that book recently and it's been </v>

255
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:27.080
<v Speaker 2>out for about 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably are.</v>

256
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I know your boy Alex Jones's mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand times in it.</v>

257
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

258
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>you know the truth about the Bilderberg </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

259
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 2>it was written like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep updating it.</v>

260
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never vote again.</v>

261
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>It really is like 40 people running the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole fucking plant.</v>

262
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it really is though,</v>

263
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did trump get in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't think he wanted him in.</v>

264
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.230
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that sees a part of that.</v>

265
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a trick,</v>

266
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a part of it.</v>

267
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep.</v>

268
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 2>It runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't swear to God.</v>

269
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.284
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy's name is Daniel </v>

270
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>e s t u l I N it's about eight,</v>

271
00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>nine years old.</v>

272
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.563
<v Speaker 2>His book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you will fuck I write it on </v>

273
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 2>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

274
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
<v Speaker 2>I was walking around the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anything that was in a fog </v>

275
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.543
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe what a sucker I've been </v>

276
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 2>my whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I fucking bombed.</v>

277
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:12.444
<v Speaker 2>And Connecticut and not in Connecticut </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Pennsylvania wants because a buddy </v>

278
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:17.320
<v Speaker 2>of mine gave me a copy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

279
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.290
<v Speaker 2>best evidence by David Lipton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a conspiracy,</v>

280
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:24.710
<v Speaker 2>a book about the assassination by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy David Lifton,</v>

281
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 2>assassination of JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this guy who was,</v>

282
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.673
<v Speaker 2>he was apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an accountant and he was given </v>

283
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 2>some task to write some paper about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

284
00:11:35.271 --> 00:11:36.104
<v Speaker 2>the President or about the Warren </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission and as he was going through </v>

285
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>the warrant commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just this enormous thing,</v>

286
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many volumes.</v>

287
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.993
<v Speaker 2>He found all these inconsistencies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things didn't make sense and no one </v>

288
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 2>expected everyone to read whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is,</v>

289
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>900 volumes.</v>

290
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.683
<v Speaker 2>So this asshole read at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he just went into detail about </v>

291
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>how ridiculous the Warren Commission </v>
<v Speaker 2>report was.</v>

292
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.934
<v Speaker 2>And then he started investigating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual facts behind the assassination </v>

293
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It freaked me the fuck out.</v>

294
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed the president of man.</v>

295
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.030
<v Speaker 2>You went on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

296
00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done nothing.</v>

297
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight deck.</v>

298
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I've done that a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

299
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

300
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I did when I was living in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read Robert Bork,</v>

301
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:15.784
<v Speaker 2>Judge Barker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it to me it crystallized a lot of </v>

302
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>shit that I was thinking that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

303
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:22.534
<v Speaker 2>all this history and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was living in La at the time and </v>

304
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to spew some of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it lawyer companies can do.</v>

305
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 2>That probably is a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

306
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>But as the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original room at the comedy store,</v>

307
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:34.324
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really having some lady got</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking mad at me at the original </v>

308
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 2>room where I was just saying that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that women should be able to</v>

309
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 2>guard the White House.</v>

310
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bit that I had and the bit was that</v>

311
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.113
<v Speaker 2>I can guard the White House either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how I know because I met </v>

312
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Shaquille O'neal in his Dick is where my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face is.</v>

313
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the White House is experiencing a </v>

314
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Shaq attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the wrong dude to save the world.</v>

315
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Like people are not fucking even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not even.</v>

316
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>And then the joke and she was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and yelling at me and go,</v>

317
00:12:59.021 --> 00:12:59.591
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

318
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it either.</v>

319
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I the do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that?</v>

320
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't hear that part.</v>

321
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 2>They hear the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said women shouldn't.</v>

322
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they glom onto.</v>

323
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I said,</v>

324
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.203
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where she gets really crazy and </v>

325
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I wound up having to kick her out and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

326
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 2>my favorite people in the world where </v>
<v Speaker 2>all women.</v>

327
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I have a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three daughters.</v>

328
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>They're my favorite people in the planet</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

329
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 2>but I can beat the fuck out of all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and she went crazy.</v>

330
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I can't line it up,</v>

331
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 2>set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set it up and put the house on me.</v>

332
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.023
<v Speaker 2>What you just crystallize there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been going through for like 30 </v>

333
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 2>years on staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

334
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying myself,</v>

335
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:36.844
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel with physical combat on a daily </v>

336
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 2>basis almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you can and can't do.</v>

337
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.793
<v Speaker 2>You can't leave a girl guarding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking White House by yourself unless </v>

338
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>you have that bitch in a robo cop suit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fucking nuclear weapons.</v>

339
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

340
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.803
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my bits was talking about women </v>

341
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 2>in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was again,</v>

342
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I think I was living in la when I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

343
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:57.534
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of die because they don't throw </v>

344
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:00.034
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

345
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

346
00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:01.584
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should die because </v>

347
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Pam's grenade landed a flip from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bumper and it's one of my best,</v>

348
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it on Letterman.</v>

349
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.500
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made and,</v>

350
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.343
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time there'll be a table at girls </v>

351
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:15.110
<v Speaker 2>that would get the feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

352
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy that Ronda Rousey lost.</v>

353
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:19.114
<v Speaker 2>But in a way it makes things easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was a bunch of fucking </v>

354
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>people that were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

355
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>What about Ronda Rousey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll kick it.</v>

356
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>And I made the mistake of saying like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperbole.</v>

357
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the master of hyperbole.</v>

358
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I've exaggerated all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

359
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>she could probably beat half the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>bantamweights and true.</v>

360
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

361
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have said it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

362
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:39.904
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could beat a few that aren't good </v>

363
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>outside the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

364
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.203
<v Speaker 2>if she gets guys in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can fuck a lot of people up or judo </v>

365
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 2>is 100 percent legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her arm bars are amongst the best in the</v>

366
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:48.994
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're always saying that bank debt </v>

367
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

368
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>she'll flip your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>

369
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked.</v>

370
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fuck you up.</v>

371
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>But the point is even with some coconut </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil or all these fucking.</v>

372
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Ronda Rousey Ronda,</v>

373
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And then thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that she's lost,</v>

375
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 1>everyone's relaxed with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the argument is,</v>

376
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who she lost to.</v>

377
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 1>You know who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucked her up the most lesbian.</v>

378
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.343
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

380
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.023
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing with the feminist </v>

381
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to,</v>

382
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do anything men can do,</v>

383
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.060
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't push the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they did,</v>

384
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>but not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

385
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I was at Gotham comedy club about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I'm doing a fight.</v>

386
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had nothing to do with me.</v>

387
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Two tables got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a big.</v>

388
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a woman in the middle standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle,</v>

389
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean like a butch dykey like</v>

390
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:39.690
<v Speaker 1>a brunch.</v>

391
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>She's thinks that she can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got her hands up,</v>

392
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.113
<v Speaker 1>she throws a punch at one of the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>man or woman comes over and knocks her </v>

393
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was fucking Larry Holmes in his</v>

394
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went down like she was shot and uh,</v>

395
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I never heard any lawsuits or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was throwing haymakers at that,</v>

396
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really believe.</v>

397
00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

398
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be scared of that broad.</v>

399
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez and knock a lot of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

401
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:04.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

402
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ken Lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could be something there.</v>

403
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

404
00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:10.110
<v Speaker 1>she's half a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.940
<v Speaker 1>that was an interesting to just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

406
00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not,</v>

407
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>she's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's all woman.</v>

408
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>She's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think some of her.</v>

409
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 1>She's got a little more in a less </v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen than my wife.</v>

410
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 1>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more man.</v>

411
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.353
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all by saying that I'm not </v>

412
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.070
<v Speaker 1>being derogatory and I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

413
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I think she should be more celebrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than she is because she's the first ever</v>

414
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>woman of lesbian champion in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

415
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't see how come lesbians get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own designation.</v>

416
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not just gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's lbg,</v>

418
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 1>lesbian and gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they get their own thing.</v>

419
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 1>They're not just gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be a gay woman.</v>

420
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 1>You're also a lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a gay man is not a thing.</v>

421
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't have an extra thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're also a lesbian,</v>

422
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

425
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 1>lesbians are not just gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their own little designation.</v>

426
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get what they want.</v>

427
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.570
<v Speaker 1>This I was reading,</v>

00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:10.104
<v Speaker 3>where we worried more about the safety </v>
<v Speaker 3>of women and children than men who like </v>

454
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:16.810
<v Speaker 3>to wear dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those memes online.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

463
00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:38.004
<v Speaker 3>I said to these young kids and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage like these kids in their </v>

464
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:40.134
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you should be taken advantage of </v>

465
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 3>this confusion.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the ladies room and go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I identify as a dyke tonight.</v>

468
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Open that I'm Annie Lennox went back </v>
<v Speaker 3>when she used to wear suits,</v>

469
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'm definitely a woman.</v>

470
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.823
<v Speaker 3>Any Linux used to wear suits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet dreams are made of and I don't </v>

471
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 3>remember what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>

472
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:04.321
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when.</v>

473
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 3>That was big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we looking at it going,</v>

474
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will.</v>

475
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.170

<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Beautiful shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did she come up there?</v>

477
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:16.494
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

478
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 3>she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a woman.</v>

479
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 3>She actually looks good there for crisis</v>
<v Speaker 3>with orange hair.</v>

480
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like if trump was transgender</v>

481
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 3>in his teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even as teens.</v>

482
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like 11.</v>

483
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 3>It looks like the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a weird haircut.</v>

484
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to let his hair go.</v>

485
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get him on mushrooms.</v>

486
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Get them shave his head toe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump can change a lot.</v>

487
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.010
<v Speaker 3>He should let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gray.</v>

488
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 3>He's not just great like what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on?</v>

489
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.123
<v Speaker 3>I don't know is there's so much stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in his head while he's got a </v>

490
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 3>trim around the years.</v>

491
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 3>This isn't 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75.</v>

492
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's picky.</v>

493
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 3>He likes keeping it long so he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking spin it around and cover all the</v>

494
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>barren lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

495
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hide a lot of deficiencies.</v>

496
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.183
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely got something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole theory as to what's </v>

497
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:14.514
<v Speaker 3>happening in his hair that there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that ran a company that </v>

498
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:19.584
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would take hair and they would buy </v>

499
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.443
<v Speaker 3>hair from like people in India and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they bleach it to whatever color your </v>

500
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>hair is and then they would attach it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your skull,</v>

501
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 3>these micro filaments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of get that done.</v>

502
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like shit and they went out of</v>

503
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:33.144
<v Speaker 3>business except they had an office in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump tower right below below trump's </v>

504
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 3>office and so the company went out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

505
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 3>but the office still remains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that he's the only client</v>

506
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.553
<v Speaker 3>and trump comes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets his hair done by this guy who was </v>

507
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Speaker 3>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

508
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a great</v>

509
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was like esquire or Gq,</v>

510
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 2>like one of those magazines and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the secret behind trump's hair.</v>

511
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 2>There's this whole investigative report </v>
<v Speaker 2>on trump's hair.</v>

512
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.230
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a plot for CBS Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

513
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Did you see what was going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was chilly.</v>

514
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.460
<v Speaker 2>There was a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a newspaper that had a photo of trump or</v>

515
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:08.990
<v Speaker 2>they use the Alec Baldwin picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the Donald trump picked.</v>

516
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up or they did it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

517
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.330
<v Speaker 2>He did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBC will be doing that gun we fucked up.</v>

518
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

519
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.853
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what the guy used to do the </v>

520
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.173
<v Speaker 2>micro cylinder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like these little things that </v>

521
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:24.514
<v Speaker 2>glue to your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like the hairs are coming </v>

522
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:27.364
<v Speaker 2>straight out of your scalp because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>glue these little like little tiny hula </v>

523
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 2>hoops with hair attached to it I guess.</v>

524
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And it sticks right out of your hair </v>
<v Speaker 2>right out of your head.</v>

525
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't totally understand it.</v>

526
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 2>It's probably like pubes from a third </v>
<v Speaker 2>world country.</v>

527
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which makes sense because his hair looks</v>

528
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.680
<v Speaker 2>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

529
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See 500 here is added in 90 minutes.</v>

530
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 2>He's got this thing going around his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

531
00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is like trump's hair.</v>

532
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

533
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was bald and now he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>this flop that.</v>

534
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's a wave in Hawaii.</v>

535
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Somebody should be writing like it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His hair doesn't make any sense.</v>

536
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's so much volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so little volume at the same time.</v>

537
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>

538
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you 70,</v>

539
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be long in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well all of it should.</v>

540
00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.773
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why not just shave your fucking </v>

541
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.310
<v Speaker 2>head bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy.</v>

542
00:22:17.311 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're worth a fucking $100,000,000,000.</v>

543
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You or your wife has not down with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the way you look.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like shave your fucking head.</v>

545
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.953
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're that age and you got </v>

546
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 2>that much here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to shave it.</v>

547
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Like you look good for the ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

548
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just kissing your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do.</v>

562
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>was so outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was really good.</v>

563
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they would put in there,</v>

564
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>it was like a fraction of what I wrote.</v>

565
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.950
<v Speaker 2>What I wrote was filled with swear words</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not mine.</v>

566
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.963
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would just let Leo female side show </v>

567
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.483
<v Speaker 2>with a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My female side is all they left in the </v>

568
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:48.674
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I smoked a joint and I wrote </v>

572
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 2>something crazy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah to them and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it made sense.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

577
00:23:59.031 --> 00:23:59.830
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

578
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.663
<v Speaker 2>Because you said like in a few years </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the grasp of the whole article was </v>

579
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you saying let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it out.</v>

580
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like you love your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write it in a car and stuff.</v>

581
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Let that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in a few years we're going to be</v>

582
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 2>able to read each other's minds.</v>

583
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.893
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that the justice and it made </v>

584
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 2>sense and I usually don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

585
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

586
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:15.863
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're about 30 years away from being </v>

587
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 2>mind reading robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

588
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've got to be done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't give a fuck.</v>

589
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I think we're gonna we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a combination of people and</v>

590
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 2>machine within the next 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

591
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you think about how close we </v>

592
00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:33.704
<v Speaker 2>are with communication about how we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet and send pictures and share </v>

593
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 2>information so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost instantaneously,</v>

594
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.713
<v Speaker 2>then the next possible step is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be closer than that and </v>

595
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:46.680
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have that shit in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and we're going to make a chip that</v>

596
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.660
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think so they were already doing or</v>

597
00:24:49.661 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've some probably.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that seemed like they had chips.</v>

599
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.300

<v Speaker 2>When I open them up.</v>

696

<v Speaker 2>long time that eggs are bad for you.</v>

711
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:46.530
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like good.</v>

712
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Last you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two weeks.</v>

713
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's [inaudible] you hypostome oh </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

714
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm still hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

715
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.113
<v Speaker 3>I have this right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a workout while I'm talking to </v>

716
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:58.500
<v Speaker 3>people and I want to try that elk Ross </v>
<v Speaker 3>get made.</v>

717
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping you had some leftovers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

718
00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:01.914
<v Speaker 3>my buddy John Dudley had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chad board on his podcast and Chad Ward </v>

719
00:30:05.081 --> 00:30:08.350
<v Speaker 3>is this a barbecue master and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically saying that we're,</v>

720
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.203
<v Speaker 3>when I cook that what I'm doing by </v>
<v Speaker 3>grilling things over high heat that you </v>

721
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 3>fuck it up because you dry out the meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat.</v>

722
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.241
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

723
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:17.074
<v Speaker 3>well what does he say to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says don't cook anything over 275 </v>

724
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:19.511
<v Speaker 3>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

725
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:20.344
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try it.</v>

726
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.243
<v Speaker 3>So I put an elk roast on last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put a meat thermometer in that bitch </v>

727
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:24.244
<v Speaker 3>and I love it in slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low and slow for like an hour and a </v>

728
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

729
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I cooked this roast and it wasn't a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>roast either.</v>

730
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Cook different hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It to 125 degrees.</v>

731
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Then I took up frying pan and you said </v>
<v Speaker 3>the south side?</v>

732
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with with butter.</v>

733
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Hot butter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>butter.</v>

734
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.573
<v Speaker 3>You wrap it up in aluminum foil and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in a cooler because the cooler </v>

735
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:44.710
<v Speaker 3>will keep it warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like it keeps it cold.</v>

736
00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it in a Yeti cooler.</v>

737
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:48.454
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what the.</v>

739
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.303
<v Speaker 3>All those barbecue masters do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let it finish in a cooler and then </v>

740
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I pulled that bitch out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sliced it up.</v>

741
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at the pictures.</v>

742
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 3>It was cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

743
00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.044
<v Speaker 3>Was He right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so delicious and it was so much </v>

744
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:01.924
<v Speaker 3>moister than any row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd cook some delicious rose in the </v>

745
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were always a good cook.</v>

746
00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.190
<v Speaker 3>I've been told that I can cut into it </v>
<v Speaker 3>too soon and that's why there's all that</v>

747
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.033
<v Speaker 3>bleeding out.</v>

748
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.830
<v Speaker 3>A teenager was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I poured that blood all over it.</v>

749
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed that behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

750
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 3>What's on the outside of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

751
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.590
<v Speaker 3>What's the rub?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to turn this into kosher salt.</v>

752
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Kosher salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black pepper and garlic powder.</v>

753
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 3>So I put all that on before I put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>

754
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.594
<v Speaker 3>before I put it into the grill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I put it into the pellet grill </v>

755
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>pellet grills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have one of those,</v>

756
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a pellet gun.</v>

757
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you?</v>

758
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd squirrels and shit.</v>

759
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pellet grills are the shit because they,</v>

760
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.240
<v Speaker 3>they maintain the same temperature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all run on wood because it's.</v>

761
00:31:45.241 --> 00:31:46.074
<v Speaker 3>It's totally healthy because they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>an element like a heating element in </v>

762
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:51.280
<v Speaker 3>there and they have these wood pellets </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wood.</v>

763
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Pellets are made when they cut wood for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a table like this,</v>

764
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.383
<v Speaker 3>they take the hardwood from that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then decompress it and then natural </v>

765
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:01.360
<v Speaker 3>sugars in the would allow it to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these pellets and the pellets.</v>

766
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.193
<v Speaker 3>You can break them up in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're like really easy </v>

767
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 3>to break because they're not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>solid,</v>

768
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.863
<v Speaker 3>but when the heating element cooks them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the heat from that and the fire </v>

769
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 3>from the pellets and the smoke flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meat.</v>

770
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.560
<v Speaker 3>So it's natural wood flavor and 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent natural.</v>

771
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>No Chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get flavored pellets,</v>

772
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

773
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.263
<v Speaker 3>you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

774
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 3>you can get apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>applewood,</v>

775
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.150
<v Speaker 3>you can get oak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get hickory.</v>

776
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have posted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can probably start it.</v>

777
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.050
<v Speaker 3>You could probably start your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

778
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have a bunch of girls sit in there </v>

779
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 3>by the lumberyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take it rubbing on the snatch that.</v>

780
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:36.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looked.</v>

781
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

782
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is cooked perfectly well.</v>

783
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Nice crunch on the outside to guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

784
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because before I was doing it all by eye</v>

785
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 3>and doing it by timing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but using a meat thermometer.</v>

786
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I got the inside to 125 degrees this </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not quite enough.</v>

787
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a little low then cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

788
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:54.374
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when you sear it on the outside </v>

789
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 3>it gets a little more inside because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

790
00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:01.310
<v Speaker 3>And then when you wrap it up in aluminum</v>
<v Speaker 3>foil because a searing it was only a few</v>

791
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 3>minutes and then you see her at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just the opposite.</v>

792
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:05.984
<v Speaker 3>What people used to do the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this guy's a world champion </v>

793
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 3>barbecue guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just listened to him,</v>

794
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know ma'am.</v>

795
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:14.000
<v Speaker 3>They do it differently at certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>steakhouses that state councilors you're</v>

796
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:18.170
<v Speaker 3>cooking a beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beef steak and a beef steak is so filled</v>

797
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:20.080
<v Speaker 3>with fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so different now.</v>

798
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

799
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 3>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it lean,</v>

800
00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 3>super lean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch back.</v>

801
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most flavorful.</v>

802
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Usually isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people eat beef.</v>

803
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 3>It's got a rich different kind of taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it because it's just,</v>

804
00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:36.370
<v Speaker 3>it's such a healthy animal because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a giant fucking animal and it's out</v>

805
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.180
<v Speaker 3>there running around eating whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it wants.</v>

806

<v Speaker 3>When you hit it on the one on one,</v>

824
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 3>it's not shot with a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was my cousin.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I dunno man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You went to Englewood.</v>

829
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.403
<v Speaker 3>I went to watts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found it outside of a liquor store at </v>

<v Speaker 3>3:00</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is not honestly not that far from </v>

834
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was on a ranch and was pen then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not pending at all.</v>

836
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres.</v>

837
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Free Range.</v>

<v Speaker 3>outside of Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

840
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest ranch and all California and</v>

841
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.410
<v Speaker 3>so I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've hunted elk there.</v>

842
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I've got a deer that I shot in Iowa that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to cook that way tonight.</v>

843
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My cousin,</v>

844
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:22.460
<v Speaker 3>that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boeing arrows.</v>

845
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:23.294
<v Speaker 3>The way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just takes way too long to learn how </v>

846
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:28.630
<v Speaker 3>to do it for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does not loud,</v>

847
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no,</v>

848
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 3>like this is my friend Cameron hanes </v>
<v Speaker 3>always likes to describe it.</v>

849
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:34.350
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to the woods,</v>

850
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 3>like everything is peaceful and quiet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guns like boom.</v>

851
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't</v>

852
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 2>seem out of place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

853
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with a bow and Arrow,</v>

854
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like almost silence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like black,</v>

855
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just takes off and it's harder.</v>

856
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It's much a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got a little more even,</v>

857
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.760
<v Speaker 2>you got to get closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get way closer.</v>

858
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to be like sitting on its </v>
<v Speaker 2>back when you got to be fucking sneaky?</v>

859
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's really exciting about like</v>

860
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.773
<v Speaker 2>when you're stocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the most fun hunts I went </v>

861
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:00.790
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

862
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Nevada,</v>

863
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 2>we went a spot and stalk hunting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mule deer,</v>

864
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.353
<v Speaker 2>and so you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creeping up on these deer and </v>

865
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:08.934
<v Speaker 2>these fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A mule deer is one of the largest deer </v>

866
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 2>species and it lives in mostly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west.</v>

867
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

868
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a mule deer right there.</v>

869
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's a mule deer right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one with the velvet stone.</v>

870
00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.373
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deer and they live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods and you got to creep up on these </v>

871
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 2>fuckers because they're used to being </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked by mountain lions.</v>

872
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a huge,</v>

873
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.483
<v Speaker 2>like a mules ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they call them mule deer and </v>

874
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 2>see how big their fucking years.</v>

879
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a very good point,</v>

880
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 2>but as a statesman think he was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent representative.</v>

881
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem with trump is</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's plain spoken.</v>

886
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.643
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a fucking professional </v>

887
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 2>politician and know that's sort of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I like about him.</v>

888
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 2>He's not a professional message and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

922
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.610
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't get Joey Diaz doses but she </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes high doses.</v>

923
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.860
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

924
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:32.490
<v Speaker 2>she gives some to our friend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gives him half of what she takes,</v>

925
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:32.671
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's going to be fine.</v>

928
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker,</v>

929
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.043
<v Speaker 1>like an hour and a half later it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have to check on the children </v>

930
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.360
<v Speaker 1>and make sure they're still breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

931
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And next day he was still high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day woke up for breakfast,</v>

932
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.480
<v Speaker 1>still high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tripping his balls off because when</v>

933
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a psychedelic drug.</v>

934
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

935
00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

936
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.193
<v Speaker 1>literally I hadn't smoked a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't ever a weed guy since like the </v>

937
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:04.204
<v Speaker 1>early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just weed in general is stronger and </v>

938
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 1>then to make it an edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did the typical rookie stupid</v>

939
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:13.150
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a corner of it and I waited about</v>

940
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 1>31 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

941
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:16.260
<v Speaker 1>this ain't doing shit exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate the rest,</v>

942
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 1>like a snickers bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing.</v>

943
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking those are the four words.</v>

944
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never say after you take weed.</v>

945
00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel shit.</v>

946
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It was my first word yourself up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

947
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

948
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:30.124
<v Speaker 1>I didn't eat the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I took another bite and then I'm </v>

949
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 1>watching my fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

950
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.594
<v Speaker 1>my flat screen TV 51 inch and then all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden it looked like a black and </v>

951
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 1>white 11 inch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start freaking and it sounded a mile</v>

953
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:43.414
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran into a dark bedroom in standard </v>

954
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.250
<v Speaker 1>alarm clock.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

957
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.120

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

958
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing to do.</v>

959
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 1>If you ever really freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have too much pot,</v>

960
00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 1>your system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink coffee.</v>

<v Speaker 1>take a cold shower.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If I could put ice in the water tank,</v>

971
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I would do that.</v>

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.380
<v Speaker 3>people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize how risky it is.</v>

00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Like you ever see someone trying to fix </v>

<v Speaker 3>I was at a gas station recently in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and some asshole came up to </v>

1051
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.960
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me about my car and he's smoking a</v>

1052
00:43:47.961 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 3>cigarette and the guy who run the gas </v>
<v Speaker 3>station screaming at him,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you bitch.</v>

1055
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:56.744
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird guy was just hanging out </v>

1056
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 3>wearing black and I wasn't black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was weird.</v>

1057
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 3>He was like pretending the Indian guy I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you know good though.</v>

1058
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

1059
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.003
<v Speaker 3>It was so caricature because he was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a caricature of an Indian gas station </v>

1060
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:12.614
<v Speaker 3>owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he really wasn't actually in India </v>

1061
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a gas station that I go to is </v>
<v Speaker 3>run by Indians and they even have like a</v>

1062
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:19.754
<v Speaker 3>fucking old sign on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the peaceful gas station </v>

1063
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.290
<v Speaker 3>because the nicest people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all Indians at work.</v>

1064
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.660
<v Speaker 3>They're super cool.</v>

1065
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.263

<v Speaker 1>like when I'm doing a show and they </v>

1066
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:32.010

<v Speaker 2>the rest of the audience,</v>

1069
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.453
<v Speaker 2>look at this Indian table with manners </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Indians in general are very </v>

1070
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 2>interesting people because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>caste system that they don't.</v>

1071
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.550
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have rich people,</v>

1072
00:44:48.551 --> 00:44:49.384
<v Speaker 2>like extremely rich people that exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>with extremely poor people with no </v>

1073
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1098
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I always got along with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other people have issues with them,</v>

1099
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.840
<v Speaker 2>but I never know what that issue is </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1100
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You know when someone has issues with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1103
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.680

1106
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:12.084
<v Speaker 2>some people are the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone said this to me and I </v>

1107
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with it,</v>

1108
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 2>but this is what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1109
00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:17.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the only reason why he's as famous </v>

1110
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he's Indian.</v>

1111
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:20.320
<v Speaker 2>He's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.070
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1115
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.353
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he's a fucking hard hard worker </v>

1116
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 2>because I played up at Albany and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to Tommy Nikki because name that</v>

<v Speaker 2>I believe it's five.</v>

1121
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 2>We worked together at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1122
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.343
<v Speaker 2>and he some point I did three shows in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>row back to back three shows in a row </v>

1123

<v Speaker 2>and he's got his notes out and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on material follow anybody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.293
<v Speaker 2>Good for him at this thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone becomes famous where </v>

1126
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 2>instead of people like if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't get it,</v>

1127
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

1128
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't talk shit about.</v>

1129
00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1130
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.933
<v Speaker 2>After Bay when we were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm much better now when you're </v>

1131
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get into the business,</v>

1132
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he making it?</v>

1133
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when you see how hard it is and you</v>

1134
00:47:18.151 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 2>got to put the work in regard this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said in this context,</v>

1135
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you might not like what they do and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get older you can appreciate what it</v>

1136
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.340
<v Speaker 2>took to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Black.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You might want to put that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking article it.</v>

1199
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 1>So she bought this store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't tell.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1204
00:49:56.591 --> 00:49:57.424
<v Speaker 1>It could be a white lid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing I was just guessing </v>

1205
00:49:59.061 --> 00:50:00.480
<v Speaker 1>that the way he said it and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1206
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to hurt his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1207
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help his career.</v>

<v Speaker 1>day and a half.</v>

1217
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Well he actually had to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

1218
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.330
<v Speaker 2>apologized.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They were asking where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to kill him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Some people like we're supposed to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital.</v>

1250
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't make it to the hospital as </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents probably.</v>

1251
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.740

<v Speaker 2>He'll never escape that.</v>

1256
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:57.350

<v Speaker 2>pulled them from the fucking cabinet and</v>

1264
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1265
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he still seemed kind of whiny to me.</v>

1266
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 2>And then I saw him in the Yankee </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform.</v>

1267
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus h Christ is gaunt,</v>

1268
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 2>his lower pussy area was sticking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that guy's seen as Dick.</v>

1269
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.810
<v Speaker 2>No one way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1270
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I think his wife could see it from where</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

1271
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to be offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

1272
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 2>looked like an ice cream cone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started fucking.</v>

1273
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.150
<v Speaker 2>He looks like one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use for pastries to write.</v>

1274
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Happy Birthday.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1276
00:52:40.461 --> 00:52:41.294
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1277
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.120
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he know what he looked like?</v>

1278
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.233
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely not one that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have been better in a hoop </v>

1279
00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 2>skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1280
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This poor bastard is an addict.</v>

1281
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That is a food addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is 100 percent.</v>

1282
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Look at the one above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to the one above it.</v>

1283
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one which shows his pussy area.</v>

1284
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck is going on there?</v>

1285
00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1286
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Christ.</v>

1287
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like Hillary's pantsuit.</v>

1288
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 2>A goddamn insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a goddamn insane pose to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1290
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 2>If you look like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't stand like that.</v>

1291
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>You should stand like a sumo wrestler at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all times.</v>

1292
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Speaker 2>You should have a wide stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should never let your legs rub together.</v>

1293
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.970
<v Speaker 2>You should be standing like you're ready</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shoot a blast.</v>

1294
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Double on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you have advisors Jan term?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do Control.</v>

1296
00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:25.820
<v Speaker 2>My volume was probably over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't hear myself.</v>

1297
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They only got right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that letter to right there?</v>

1298

<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on way low.</v>

1300
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 2>He I got to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1301
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Even if he was skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we dropped piggy.</v>

1302
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Even if even if he was skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like a horrible.</v>

1303
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Well he doesn't have the best genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more important than that.</v>

1304
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.953
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows if he has the best genetics </v>

1305
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>because I looked it up on the genealogy </v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

1306
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's he from?</v>

1307
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 2>His mother was a Malibu in Sicily and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be running there.</v>

1308
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 2>It looks like Kevin James there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get that fucking guy in shape.</v>

1309
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:55.404
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God I'd have to do is get </v>

1310
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 2>them off.</v>

1311
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 2>The sugar would take awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's addicted to sugar.</v>

1312
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives on salads.</v>

1313
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:01.944
<v Speaker 2>They said no dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing is a picture of him at the game </v>

1314
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.143
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a little bag of m and m's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large bag of m and m's and he's </v>

1315
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.380
<v Speaker 2>pouring the little bag of m and m's into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the large bag of m and Ms.</v>

1316
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1317
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:15.563
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got him with the best and he's a </v>

1318
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 2>sugar addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See how he's pouring it in there?</v>

1319
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's my little one into the big one.</v>

1320
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.300
<v Speaker 2>You're not fat at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1321
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like sugar,</v>

1322
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:25.764
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping to get a ball so I could </v>

1323
00:54:26.911 --> 00:54:29.800
<v Speaker 2>lose this last 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

1324
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Know you shipped blood for 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't eat at night.</v>

1325
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this before the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

1326
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:36.953
<v Speaker 2>I when I heard you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost fainted because I've been </v>

1327
00:54:38.281 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 2>saying that to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1328
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:42.690
<v Speaker 2>the only time I've ever lost weight my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is when I'd go to bed hungry.</v>

1329
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.763
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that you lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body actually produces more dense </v>

1330
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:49.160
<v Speaker 2>muscle cell or more lean muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1331
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're burning fat,</v>

1332
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 2>well he's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also your body has more time to</v>

1333
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:56.430
<v Speaker 2>rebuild your tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You recover better.</v>

1334
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not just like going to bed hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1335
00:54:58.771 --> 00:54:59.604
<v Speaker 2>It's actually good for you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is as Dr Rhonda Patrick said </v>

1336
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can send like a little African kid,</v>

1337
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.810
<v Speaker 2>just a fucking sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just you need to edible an edible.</v>

1338
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I love you though,</v>

1339
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the last time I was here I go,</v>

1340
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1341
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:18.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about was like,</v>

1342
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.560

1343
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking sick of working out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said that to about 20 people and </v>

1344
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:22.971
<v Speaker 2>they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1345
00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:24.290
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna fucking be kidney.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1348
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.243
<v Speaker 2>They work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why you didn't even </v>

1349
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:32.411
<v Speaker 2>hesitate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

1350

<v Speaker 2>your face?</v>

1351
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Whenever someone tells me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>

1354
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the perfect time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>body if you were a younger man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do and people are like,</v>

1378
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a younger man anymore.</v>

1379
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people just want you to wither away</v>

1380
00:56:41.081 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 3>and die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have you jojo.</v>

1381
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:43.803
<v Speaker 3>I take testosterone replacement therapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've done it for almost 10 years </v>

1382
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 3>with 49.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1383
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Thirty nine started when I was like 39,</v>
<v Speaker 3>37,</v>

1384
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:53.740
<v Speaker 3>38.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start rubbing this cream on me.</v>

1385
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Which wasn't that effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the clear?</v>

1386
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1387
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:58.223
<v Speaker 3>That's anything I take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take mild stuff like that or my dog </v>

1388
00:57:03.121 --> 00:57:03.954
<v Speaker 3>and here's the thing about the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like barry bonds takes and all the </v>

1389
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders take like they're taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like hyper human levels.</v>

1390
00:57:09.431 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck with anything like that.</v>

1391
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 3>What I do is I take what I would have in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my body naturally when I was like 27.</v>

1392
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.293
<v Speaker 3>That's what I take so that that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy and that that does almost no </v>

1393
00:57:20.681 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 3>evidence that there's evidence that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a bad heart,</v>

1394
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:23.824
<v Speaker 3>if you're an older person and you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacking your body up with testosterone </v>

1395
00:57:25.921 --> 00:57:28.210
<v Speaker 3>and doing crazy workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's not ready for it,</v>

1396
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.490
<v Speaker 3>but also that could be a conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1397
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1398
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:33.454
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people go from being sedentary and </v>

1399
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:35.794
<v Speaker 3>out of shape to all of a sudden having </v>
<v Speaker 3>young levels of testosterone and then </v>

1400
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.001
<v Speaker 3>get shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1401
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 3>So that's when you factor in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations with people that have um,</v>

1402
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.233
<v Speaker 3>like pretty significant heart issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>after taking testosterone therapy </v>

1403
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.900
<v Speaker 3>according to my doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're dealing with these,</v>

1404
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.790
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

1405
00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 3>you have to judge each one of them on an</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual basis and he's also like,</v>

1406
00:57:55.151 --> 00:57:55.984
<v Speaker 3>you have to get your blood work done and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be really meticulous about </v>

1407
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 3>it was I get my blood work done every </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of months,</v>

1408
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.630
<v Speaker 3>but not just for testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just for her,</v>

1409
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:05.231
<v Speaker 3>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1410
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 3>for bad stuff.</v>

1411
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:07.700
<v Speaker 3>And also for nutrient levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure,</v>

1412
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 3>like I found out that I need more nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>into my system.</v>

1413
00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I found out I need more vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vitamin D,</v>

1414
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>D three is a big one.</v>

1415
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.550
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important.</v>

1416
00:58:15.551 --> 00:58:16.384
<v Speaker 3>It's very important for um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a muscle is very important for the </v>

1417
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:20.344
<v Speaker 3>way your brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also works in symbiosis with a </v>

1418
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:24.680
<v Speaker 3>bunch of other nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your,</v>

1419
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.000
<v Speaker 3>your nutrient levels tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just go on.</v>

1420
00:58:27.001 --> 00:58:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I feel pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You good?</v>

1421
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.570
<v Speaker 3>You might feel pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there might be.</v>

1422
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:34.560
<v Speaker 3>There might be some fucking shortcomings</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>

1423
00:58:34.561 --> 00:58:36.730
<v Speaker 3>your diet or your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your supplementation.</v>

1424
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.793
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1425
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:38.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw them in a punch bowl.</v>

1504
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's really my white one was </v>

1505
01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:02.301

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:03.134
<v Speaker 2>he didn't hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying I thought you going </v>

1507
01:02:04.211 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 2>to say wood chipper and and then he hits</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beating up men,</v>

1508
01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever looked at him wrong.</v>

1509
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's guys like and a few other </v>

1510
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:12.410
<v Speaker 2>lineman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have singled him out.</v>

1511
01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 2>He was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People feed off each other.</v>

1512
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:15.194
<v Speaker 2>That's why mob mentality is work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why the mob mentality exists </v>

1513
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>because someone sees someone doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazy</v>

1514
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.023
<v Speaker 3>and the other people get crazy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the thing we need to </v>

1515
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 3>recognize right now that's going on like</v>
<v Speaker 3>uc Berkeley.</v>

1516
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.840
<v Speaker 3>That is mob mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't.</v>

1517
01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 3>That's not justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not rational.</v>

1518
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:30.323
<v Speaker 3>It's not a real fucking protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a goddamn mob and they are </v>

1519
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 3>rioting and they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're wrong because that guy,</v>

1520
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:36.954
<v Speaker 3>all he wants to do is talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone wants to talk and which you </v>

1521
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:40.134
<v Speaker 3>want to do is light the fucking campus </v>
<v Speaker 3>on fire and throw a fucking chair </v>

1522
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:44.670
<v Speaker 3>through a plate glass window at </v>
<v Speaker 3>starbucks.</v>

1523
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:49.470
<v Speaker 3>That is a mob mentality and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same goddamn thing and not only that,</v>

1524
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.020
<v Speaker 3>but all you're doing is pumping him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the streisand effect.</v>

1525
01:02:53.021 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you keep him from fucking pro to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>him from speaking?</v>

1526
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 3>You make him bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be even larger now because</v>

1527
01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 3>of that and you're just showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody what you're making.</v>

1528
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 3>You lost the battle of ideas when you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1529
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.300
<v Speaker 3>That's when it gets in the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1530
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.413
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This Nazi thing is fucking crazy where </v>

1531
01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:13.314
<v Speaker 3>everybody calls everybody a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the Sarah Silverman </v>

1532
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 3>thing before the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she was joking around or</v>

1533

1536
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 3>symbols on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what people do when their surveyors</v>

1537
01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 3>and they want to mark where the power is</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the gas lines are.</v>

1538
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 3>They have specific lines so that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's specific colors for electricity,</v>

1539
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 3>a different color for gas line and she's</v>

<v Speaker 2>line walking to get coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saw these Oliver Sidewalk and tournament</v>

<v Speaker 2>That gut gets burnt in an oven.</v>

1553
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least weekly on twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a dyslexic to the dyslexic German kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Draw this,</v>

1558
01:04:35.311 --> 01:04:36.030

<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

1563
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 2>so she's because of the shit that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to her on twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>some of the blame away from her for </v>

1567
01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:55.374
<v Speaker 2>putting something ridiculous on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and by saying that people tell her to </v>

1568
01:04:57.481 --> 01:05:00.120
<v Speaker 2>get an oven because she's a Jew and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is why she's sensitive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in public,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everything he does,</v>

1613
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I could tell he must've known my comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and didn't like it,</v>

1683
01:09:09.531 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 2>but it was homophobic or whatever the </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

1686
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:15.770

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he said you have the type of person</v>

1688
01:09:18.231 --> 01:09:20.800
<v Speaker 2>as to blame people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck that meant.</v>

1689
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of blaming people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you do something.</v>

1690
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Totally blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we show that to them.</v>

1691
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stupid.</v>

1692
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1693
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>they learn if you don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1694
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't blame them,</v>

1695
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:34.814
<v Speaker 2>they just keep going.</v>

1696
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.990
<v Speaker 2>They go like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother always used to say to me,</v>

1697
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:39.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't let anything go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

1698

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a learning moment.</v>

1702
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I think of it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 2>If you don't let them know,</v>

1708
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:04.544
<v Speaker 2>like super rich celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always hear that about people that </v>

1709
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:07.454
<v Speaker 2>are untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't speak to like when Meryl </v>

<v Speaker 2>They have so much money though.</v>

1745
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>What's incredible is those people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>donated so much money.</v>

1746
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:46.170
<v Speaker 2>They like the number two real estate </v>
<v Speaker 2>holders in Los Angeles.</v>

1747
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:49.370
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like starbucks.</v>

1748
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cash they ever miscavige.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a good group to have behind you.</v>

1749
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.850
<v Speaker 2>If they're behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1750
01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:56.684
<v Speaker 2>if you're a scientologist and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>also like an actor or something like </v>

1751
01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll fucking insulate you again.</v>

1752
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what I wanted to ask her if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't met her.</v>

1753
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Because you had a lot of success while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were doing that,</v>

1754
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.730
<v Speaker 2>like in your profession as an accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you attribute it to.</v>

1755
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think scientology help you?</v>

1756
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.410
<v Speaker 2>She definitely did at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I think what you think about the work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's involved,</v>

1758
01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:16.524
<v Speaker 2>like she was telling me that everyday </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd have to do two and a half hours </v>

1759
01:12:18.631 --> 01:12:19.464
<v Speaker 2>where the work every day you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly working on it and constantly </v>

1760
01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 2>like reading the stuff and going over </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1761
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I think anytime you have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline that translates over to other</v>

1762
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 2>things like people ask me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you like,</v>

1763
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:32.364
<v Speaker 2>why do you have so much discipline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with comedy or with all the like </v>

1764
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 2>how much you work so hard because I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with fighting.</v>

1765
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.153
<v Speaker 2>With fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have discipline with </v>

1766
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get fucked up.</v>

1767
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get your good sports are very good.</v>

1768
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Kids guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good to lose.</v>

1769
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to have chem class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unfair.</v>

1770
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up if you don't.</v>

1771
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I know a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say his name,</v>

1772
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but he's been pretty open about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one of the reasons why he's fucked</v>

1773
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:54.894
<v Speaker 2>up as an adult because his parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't encourage him to do anything </v>

1774
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:59.240
<v Speaker 2>competitive when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he didn't learn to live.</v>

1775
01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Mark Marin,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but for exercises specifically for </v>

2004
01:21:32.371 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just start now and within the last few</v>

2005
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.303
<v Speaker 1>years because I had shoulder injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the best ones ever is </v>

2006
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:41.520
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you showed me,</v>

2008
01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I showed you this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've recently gotten into what the fuck?</v>

2009

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2010
01:21:45.891 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 1>there's only 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do bottoms up,</v>

2011
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:50.200
<v Speaker 1>meaning you hold it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to balance it.</v>

2012
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Stabilization Muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2013
01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Constantly adjusting and move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that lands on your nose.</v>

2014
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all good for your grip too.</v>

2023
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:17.760
<v Speaker 1>exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything in the shoulders.</v>

2024

<v Speaker 2>I had always thought that to be a comic </v>

2059
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 2>you had to be out of shape and goofy </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking and I always felt they hate us.</v>

2060
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I didn't belong.</v>

2061
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And then Joe onstage killen and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2062
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

2063
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:48.790
<v Speaker 2>They fucking still hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing has changed.</v>

2064
01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barren even admitted it to me.</v>

2065
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Like when I did his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying like,</v>

2066
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be doing this.</v>

2067
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:55.900
<v Speaker 2>This is our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2068
01:23:55.901 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 2>well that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the mentality.</v>

2069
01:23:58.150 --> 01:23:59.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

2070
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.360
<v Speaker 2>What does that got to do with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny?</v>

2071
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I love this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have low self esteem,</v>

2072
01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:05.380
<v Speaker 2>shitty parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shitty upbringing.</v>

2073
01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.573
<v Speaker 2>You have to punch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny when you punched </v>

2074
01:24:08.221 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will that punch punching a little kid in</v>

2075
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:11.224
<v Speaker 2>the back of the head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely things that are </v>

2076
01:24:12.311 --> 01:24:13.280
<v Speaker 2>funnier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2077
01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're healthier punching,</v>

2078
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.300
<v Speaker 2>kill kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids that deserve no Irish kids,</v>

2079
01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but the punch and I had an argument with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a be canvas professor who's a,</v>

2080
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book on comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that guy?</v>

2081
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.670
<v Speaker 2>He just does his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book on on Compton.</v>

2082
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.340
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2083
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.620
<v Speaker 2>punching up is always was always </v>
<v Speaker 2>funnier,</v>

2084
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:33.454
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2085
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.960
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

2086
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:35.883
<v Speaker 2>Sam kinisons bit about starving kids in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa is one of the greatest bits of </v>

2087
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:42.970
<v Speaker 2>all time as punching down as you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get because it's so fucked up.</v>

2088
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:43.953
<v Speaker 2>You're listening to Eco Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's saying this and </v>

2089
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughing.</v>

2090
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Funny is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you acquainted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like sports and comedy,</v>

2092
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football and fighting.</v>

2093
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fight.</v>

2094
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down sideways every day.</v>

2095
01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:56.951
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of ways.</v>

2096
01:24:56.951 --> 01:24:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2097
01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 2>They come from punches come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2098
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.513
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why this whole thing about </v>

2099
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:05.980
<v Speaker 2>punching down so fucking stupid or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you have to be a Dork in order</v>

2100
01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:06.640
<v Speaker 2>to be funny.</v>

2101
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of the funniest people I ever met </v>
<v Speaker 2>were savages.</v>

2102
01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where I learned how to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

2103
01:25:10.641 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 2>He was in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys.</v>

2104
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why I got into stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the first place.</v>

2105
01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I would make people laugh when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a bus on the way that tournament.</v>

2106
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:18.843
<v Speaker 2>It was like gallows humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was scared and I would be the </v>

2107
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:24.760
<v Speaker 2>guy who is making everybody laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were all savages.</v>

2108
01:25:24.761 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are Tan with the linemen that</v>

2109
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:27.904
<v Speaker 2>took the kids there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some of the funniest </v>

2110
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers have ever met in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not dumb jock.</v>

2111
01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:32.801
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2112
01:25:32.801 --> 01:25:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean they would actually come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever shit and.</v>

2113
01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah that was the mentality.</v>

2114
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Like Kevin Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember good soccer player.</v>

2115

<v Speaker 2>really good soccer player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2117
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:43.571
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2118
01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:44.404
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2119
01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.453

<v Speaker 2>him and me came together at the Boston </v>

2120
01:25:48.371 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was another one and they hated us.</v>

2121
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Jeannine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell and I love fucking gene.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which made me like her number one.</v>

2135

2206
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:10.343
<v Speaker 2>a Black Dick joke or something and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of implied that's what I do is </v>

2207
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:15.990
<v Speaker 2>something like me and turned on him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2208
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.120

<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

2209
01:29:17.121 --> 01:29:17.954
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought he's kind of overrated </v>

2210
01:29:19.501 --> 01:29:20.334
<v Speaker 2>as a stamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've really grown to love his stand </v>

2211
01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:23.070
<v Speaker 2>out or stand ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

2213
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:26.730
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy but he's a nerdy who we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have nothing in common.</v>

2214
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes when I like people like </v>

<v Speaker 2>progressive?</v>

2219
01:29:41.401 --> 01:29:44.580
<v Speaker 2>People are oftentimes very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Actually.</v>

2441
01:38:26.761 --> 01:38:28.460
<v Speaker 2>your own ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when people,</v>

2442
01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 2>when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's like,</v>

2443
01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:31.854
<v Speaker 2>Seth Meyers is attacking your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ideas make it up a bunch of fucking </v>

2444
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.233
<v Speaker 2>real soft jokes about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had one very good bit that he did </v>

2445
01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 2>recently where they were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ban the ban on immigrants.</v>

2446
01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one is saying ban.</v>

2447
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:47.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not a band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never used the word ban.</v>

2448
01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:47.963
<v Speaker 2>And then he cuts to a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a montage of trump and all the other </v>

2449
01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:53.100
<v Speaker 2>saying that you could go to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>

2450
01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking cheap trickery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not as much as I used to like um,</v>

2451
01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think NBC sat him down and said,</v>

2452
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.450
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be the point man on this.</v>

2453
01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:04.443
<v Speaker 2>We think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2454
01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:05.283
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a sat down having been </v>

2455
01:39:08.611 --> 01:39:09.444
<v Speaker 2>sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a sat down and I sat </v>

2456
01:39:11.551 --> 01:39:11.970
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 2>will never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever sat me down.</v>

2458
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever sat me down and said,</v>

2459
01:39:15.571 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go this way.</v>

2460
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.360
<v Speaker 2>That's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally ever.</v>

2461
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not because you are a </v>

2462
01:39:19.421 --> 01:39:23.900
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and you lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to accuse you.</v>

2463
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Shoot an elk on the one slash nine out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the back of the bow and Arrow who the</v>

2464
01:39:26.931 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck gonna tell you to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2465
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.033
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people accuse you if you have an </v>

2466
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:35.190
<v Speaker 2>idea and you run with a cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they accuse you of being sat down by the</v>

2467
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.033
<v Speaker 2>elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course I think that point they </v>

2468
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:41.183
<v Speaker 2>didn't know it is probably how he feels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would they sit them down if you </v>

2469
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:46.700
<v Speaker 2>already know it feels that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And BC does that.</v>

2470
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 2>They never did when I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do it with you?</v>

2471
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:54.210
<v Speaker 2>But no one ever sits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people sit.</v>

2472
01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Anybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you don't.</v>

2473
01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I know they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you ever experienced not,</v>

2517
01:41:39.301 --> 01:41:40.134
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

2518
01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the word lab work like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ever,</v>

2519
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but how do you know what mean humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people are psychotic,</v>

2520
01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:47.963
<v Speaker 2>but how can we can do that here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come people can buy this country </v>

2521
01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:52.620
<v Speaker 2>held to a different standard when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to that shit?</v>

2522
01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you try sneaking into Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what's happened to you,</v>

2523
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.033
<v Speaker 2>where the cat you invite people from all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world will let us go into </v>

2524
01:41:59.041 --> 01:42:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Mexico like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2525
01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you know that you could just drive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

2526
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:02.821
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2527
01:42:02.821 --> 01:42:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done any gun illegally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just driving into my point.</v>

2528
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.490
<v Speaker 2>If you try to sneak in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2529
01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:09.324
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is when you try to go down </v>

2530
01:42:10.501 --> 01:42:11.910
<v Speaker 2>to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even stop you,</v>

2531
01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:14.280
<v Speaker 2>so you believe is dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't believe in borders.</v>

2532
01:42:14.281 --> 01:42:15.114
<v Speaker 2>You think that could actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's an even watching </v>

2533
01:42:17.611 --> 01:42:19.290
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in Europe right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2534
01:42:19.291 --> 01:42:20.124
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think part of the reason that's a </v>

2535
01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:24.930
<v Speaker 2>problem is that culturally the places </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are coming from are archaic</v>

2536
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.823
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to admit and I'm with them </v>

2537
01:42:27.211 --> 01:42:29.760
<v Speaker 2>100 percent and it's a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what's interesting,</v>

2538
01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.160
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2539
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:33.211
<v Speaker 2>It is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

2540
01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:35.010
<v Speaker 2>All cultures aren't equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never were.</v>

2541
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not only the.</v>

2542
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:39.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the left main tenant was a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those.</v>

2543
01:42:39.391 --> 01:42:42.450
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me is that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures that are the problem,</v>

2544
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:44.920
<v Speaker 2>they're uncredible massage.</v>

2545
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:45.763
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're ready to fucking feminist </v>

2546
01:42:46.621 --> 01:42:47.760
<v Speaker 2>yelling at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you.</v>

2547
01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.653
<v Speaker 2>If you say anything about those year </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia and you're a right wing </v>

2548
01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:52.164
<v Speaker 2>hate monger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about cultures that </v>

2549
01:42:53.521 --> 01:42:56.700
<v Speaker 2>are incredibly restrictive of women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>

2550
01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like 11 a.</v>

2551
01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my point.</v>

2552
01:43:00.721 --> 01:43:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And even Bill Maher pointed it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:04.350
<v Speaker 2>He was yelling at the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminist.</v>

2554
01:43:04.351 --> 01:43:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Where are you yelling at trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he loves to grab pussy.</v>

2555
01:43:07.261 --> 01:43:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile they lopping off heads because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl shows their ankle.</v>

2556
01:43:09.781 --> 01:43:12.020
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what I'm talking about.</v>

2557
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to make me have to be like</v>

2558
01:43:13.831 --> 01:43:14.680
<v Speaker 2>a huge trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2559
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2560
01:43:15.721 --> 01:43:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take the watchers like that,</v>

2561
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:21.000
<v Speaker 2>but at one point in time that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>norm,</v>

2562
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:22.530
<v Speaker 2>like 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 years ago.</v>

2563
01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:23.940
<v Speaker 2>That was a normal worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2564
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a restrictive policies against</v>

2565
01:43:27.181 --> 01:43:29.850
<v Speaker 2>women and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the norm worldwide.</v>

2566
01:43:29.851 --> 01:43:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2567
01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:31.403
<v Speaker 2>So how is it not that you are right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>in California because people progress </v>

2568
01:43:34.111 --> 01:43:34.944
<v Speaker 2>and evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't you think she can progress </v>

2569
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:39.510
<v Speaker 2>involve worldwide to the point where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to have right now.</v>

2570
01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:42.000
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't even a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time.</v>

2571
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:43.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my question is will there be a time </v>

2572
01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:48.030
<v Speaker 2>where people can just go everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you don't think the world works</v>

2573
01:43:48.031 --> 01:43:49.470
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

2574
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.000
<v Speaker 2>People all flawed as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're definitely fly the</v>

2575
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 3>species here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to change.</v>

2576
01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:56.480
<v Speaker 3>You could drive to sonoma right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's gonna stop you.</v>

2577
01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:57.314
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to show your papers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's gotta be a come a </v>

2578
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:00.044
<v Speaker 3>time in history where human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to travel freely wherever they </v>

2579
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 3>want to go live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever they want to go,</v>

2580
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing that's stopping that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it.</v>

2581
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Some places are far less far less </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperous than we are here.</v>

2582
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:12.750
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2583
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.910
<v Speaker 1>what it states deeper and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperous.</v>

2584
01:44:14.911 --> 01:44:15.744
<v Speaker 1>It's because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing what's going on in Europe </v>

2585
01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:19.943
<v Speaker 1>and it's not fucking working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as close to open borders as </v>

2586
01:44:22.171 --> 01:44:23.670
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2587
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of these other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got a little silly and they thought</v>

2588
01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:28.693
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world is like them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just let all these immigrants in </v>

2589
01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:31.933
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is not that we should let </v>

2590
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 3>everybody in and just let do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

2591
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 3>My point is that at some point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be the way the world works</v>

2592
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:43.490
<v Speaker 3>where you could literally go anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want and then I don't think.</v>

2593
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:44.383
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Tower of Babel and the idea </v>

2594
01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:47.314
<v Speaker 3>that one point in time people spoke one </v>
<v Speaker 3>language and then the God decided they </v>

2595
01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:51.920
<v Speaker 3>were getting too crazy and then he split</v>
<v Speaker 3>them up,</v>

2596
01:44:51.921 --> 01:44:52.754
<v Speaker 3>but all over the world and gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different languages to never </v>

2597
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.333
<v Speaker 3>communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that if human beings </v>

2598
01:44:57.711 --> 01:44:59.510
<v Speaker 3>continue along the path that we're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2599
01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.640
<v Speaker 3>how long it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's 5,000</v>

2600
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:02.474
<v Speaker 3>years or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to come to a point in time </v>

2601
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:04.514
<v Speaker 3>where we have a universal language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be within our grandchildren's </v>

2602
01:45:07.821 --> 01:45:08.654
<v Speaker 3>lifetime where people are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with people all over the </v>

2603
01:45:10.581 --> 01:45:15.581
<v Speaker 3>world and if technology can evolve our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2604
01:45:15.641 --> 01:45:16.474
<v Speaker 3>our cultures to the point where these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that live in these unbelievably </v>

2605
01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:20.234
<v Speaker 3>restrictive environments and communities</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get to the point where they're like </v>

2606
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:25.483
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

2607
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 3>We have disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're free to go wherever you want.</v>

2608
01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta be the future.</v>

2609
01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2610
01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2611
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:33.163
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make him a racist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to protect our borders and </v>

2612
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:37.510
<v Speaker 1>that's at notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at nap,</v>

2613
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.360
<v Speaker 1>fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi goes not doing anything bad.</v>

2614
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 1>This look at a view of life that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire left.</v>

2615
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Their ideas work great on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees with them.</v>

2616
01:45:47.121 --> 01:45:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be open,</v>

2617
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:49.064
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2618
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.903
<v Speaker 1>everybody should be able to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and that all make sense to toe </v>

2619
01:45:53.291 --> 01:45:54.124
<v Speaker 1>the rubber hits the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good technically and it will </v>

2620
01:45:56.961 --> 01:45:58.460
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they'll get there,</v>

2621
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying you can't label </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fascist and a racist that want to</v>

2622
01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:05.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking protect the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

2623
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who loves lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows because they are like Italians </v>

2624
01:46:08.391 --> 01:46:09.224
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like I'm not just Latinos now </v>

2625
01:46:10.851 --> 01:46:13.940
<v Speaker 1>we have Central America and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>world coming and Canadian.</v>

2626
01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm half Canadian.</v>

2627
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:16.574
<v Speaker 1>French Canada.</v>

2628
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.113
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really fucked up is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy to come over here from </v>

2629
01:46:20.071 --> 01:46:20.904
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to come over from </v>

2630
01:46:22.441 --> 01:46:23.274
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made it more difficult for </v>

2631
01:46:25.711 --> 01:46:26.544
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other places that are like almost offer </v>

<v Speaker 3>zero problems to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To emigrate to America.</v>

2633
01:46:31.741 --> 01:46:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're a Canadian and you tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a job in America,</v>

2634
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.153

2642
01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.340

<v Speaker 1>I mean Obama</v>

2643
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.173
<v Speaker 2>was busting people to cities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping them off without even telling </v>

2644
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:55.240
<v Speaker 2>the mayors and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you know.</v>

2647
01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.220
<v Speaker 2>His.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was his.</v>

2648
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Was his idea of executive orders?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you know what the order was?</v>

2651
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now now you're getting almost asking.</v>

2652
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.360

<v Speaker 2>I've never heard this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aca and all that stuff is questionably </v>

2654
01:47:12.341 --> 01:47:14.520
<v Speaker 2>on constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't hear about it exactly because</v>

2655
01:47:14.521 --> 01:47:15.354
<v Speaker 2>the media wouldn't cover it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go online and talking to mayors </v>

2656
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools are being,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts schools are being </v>

2659
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:28.070
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed by kids who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2660
01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.420
<v Speaker 2>have been here for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

2661
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Lot of unconstitutional shit went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2662
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I never heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making it up.</v>

2663
01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:39.210
<v Speaker 2>It was so many things going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2664
01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:40.860
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to be abreast of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2665
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2666
01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Just it's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

2667
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just got so lucky.</v>

2668
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got so fucking lucky geographically.</v>

2669
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh the luckiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2670
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:56.640
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all changed.</v>

2671
01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.180
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean plane?</v>

2672
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:02.220
<v Speaker 2>They can fly over now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to fucking,</v>

2673
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's all changed.</v>

2674
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Nine slash 11 or trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a long time ago,</v>

2675
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying you were right for years</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of a.</v>

2676
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.050
<v Speaker 2>We were at geographically with two </v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans will not just bought.</v>

2677
01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 2>It's things like flight and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the spot itself,</v>

2678
01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:24.060
<v Speaker 2>like just having the opportunity you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have here in America.</v>

2679
01:48:24.061 --> 01:48:26.070
<v Speaker 2>It's so unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so unusual.</v>

2680
01:48:26.071 --> 01:48:26.904
<v Speaker 2>No caste system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about India yet </v>

2681
01:48:28.291 --> 01:48:28.500
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

2682
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Yet all you hear is how racist isn't and</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic yet people,</v>

2683
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:36.110
<v Speaker 2>both black and brown people are trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sneak in a.</v>

2684
01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:37.830
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all you hear?</v>

2685
01:48:37.831 --> 01:48:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Is that America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's racist if you watch TV,</v>

2686
01:48:39.871 --> 01:48:40.920
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:48:40.921 --> 01:48:42.510
<v Speaker 2>That's all you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2688
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2689
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't want to yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You exactly.</v>

2690
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch programming the trend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

2691
01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:55.280
<v Speaker 2>You think the mainstream media is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>an has a left slant to it at all?</v>

2692
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they admit that?</v>

2693
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:58.343
<v Speaker 2>I definitely do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what people get their </v>

2694
01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:01.900
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2695
01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:02.491
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2696
01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to feel pretty alienated by the</v>

2697
01:49:04.921 --> 01:49:09.921
<v Speaker 2>media because the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is primarily in New York and La,</v>

2698
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:11.483
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are these big central locations </v>

2699
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 2>for liberal thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it weird though that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>big giant groups of people together,</v>

2701
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 2>they become liberal is weird.</v>

2702
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:21.833
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predominantly like New York dominantly </v>

2703
01:49:23.731 --> 01:49:25.470
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>California's predominantly liberal.</v>

2704
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Those are the population centers of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2705
01:49:27.031 --> 01:49:28.740
<v Speaker 2>They're also the education centers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

2706
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:30.900
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating to me that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2707
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:31.763
<v Speaker 2>and even in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago's kind of predominantly liberal </v>

2708
01:49:33.621 --> 01:49:35.490
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet they lost the election,</v>

2709
01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:37.260
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it strange though?</v>

2710
01:49:37.261 --> 01:49:38.094
<v Speaker 2>I mean I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying a bubble who don't hang </v>

2711
01:49:39.511 --> 01:49:40.770
<v Speaker 2>around with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad,</v>

2712
01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.713
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why is it though that when you get </v>

2713
01:49:43.471 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 2>giant clumps of people that have to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in huge groups,</v>

2714
01:49:46.771 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>they primarily liberal.</v>

2715
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.880
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting cities in the midwest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't,</v>

2716
01:49:50.190 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

2717
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:53.870
<v Speaker 1>That aren't liberal named one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it.</v>

2719
01:49:58.170 --> 01:49:59.930
<v Speaker 1>That's not the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2720
01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of the midwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2721
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It was the middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was liberal but.</v>

2722
01:50:03.781 --> 01:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there man?</v>

2723
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:06.820
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he wore a dress,</v>

2724
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but I sell out of Minneapolis.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I bet they do.</v>

2726
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2727
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>You're a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you'd sell out in New York.</v>

2728

<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2729
01:50:15.981 --> 01:50:16.461

<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2730
01:50:16.461 --> 01:50:17.294
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will now know when you put on the </v>

2731
01:50:18.681 --> 01:50:19.750
<v Speaker 1>robe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That seems pretty fair.</v>

2736
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.323
<v Speaker 1>What goes on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine who goes to Nyu </v>

<v Speaker 1>I covered that on my podcast.</v>

2740
01:50:39.610 --> 01:50:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Abolishing whiteness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2741
01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:42.493
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a class and almost every college </v>

2742
01:50:43.751 --> 01:50:44.950
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2743

<v Speaker 1>If I didn't have this generator first </v>

<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella who was on the podcast is </v>

2793
01:52:47.451 --> 01:52:50.330
<v Speaker 1>a very famous hunter and author and </v>

<v Speaker 1>He was telling me that there was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous mountain man and a wolf was his </v>

2798
01:53:03.891 --> 01:53:04.724
<v Speaker 1>eating a wolf because you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

2858
01:55:39.021 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2859
01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like a silent epidemic in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

2860
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Those goddamn and come off the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer that come off the deal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2862
01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:48.630
<v Speaker 1>But it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2863
01:55:48.631 --> 01:55:52.470
<v Speaker 1>When I shot that deer in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found a bunch of ticks on it.</v>

2864
01:55:52.471 --> 01:55:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We got to be super careful cleaning it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2865
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

2866
01:55:55.591 --> 01:55:56.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2867
01:55:56.251 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 1>We found ticks like nearest balls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2868
01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ticks,</v>

2869
01:56:00.361 --> 01:56:02.600
<v Speaker 1>love balls won't fix her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gross man.</v>

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:03.453
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking creepy little animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have this bizarre disease that we </v>

2871
01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>were fairly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a recent disease.</v>

2872
01:56:09.421 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2873
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's probably been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2874
01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know what it was back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

2875
01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2876
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's something that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2877
01:56:18.130 --> 01:56:18.963
<v Speaker 1>something created by the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of conspiracy theories </v>

2878
01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:22.790
<v Speaker 1>about lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2879
01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.653
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely could pay and completed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the right because it affects mostly </v>

2880
01:56:25.501 --> 01:56:26.334
<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>

2881
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:30.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
