<v Speaker 2>thing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

120
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 2>don't shed in the hot tub or like on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>roller coaster,</v>

121
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get out of your seat.</v>

122
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 2>When I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's because a dumb,</v>

123
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>dumb dumb because there might be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's in the roller coaster,</v>

124
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be more fun.</v>

125
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do it mean to do a southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

126
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the south.</v>

127
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're all done.</v>

128
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>This is too many people dogging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people talking in this </v>

129
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't use to be like that.</v>

130
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>This is a new thing</v>

131
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 4>for the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People started talking.</v>

132
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

133
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average person didn't ever voiced 20</v>

134
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:11.051
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's great things to anyone having a </v>

135
00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 4>voice crate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great,</v>

136
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 4>great things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're going to have to relearn human</v>

137
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.690
<v Speaker 4>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

138
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 4>We can't use the old rules for today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just can't work.</v>

139
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 4>He can't work and it's too easy to be an</v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

140
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 4>People got to stop seeking that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I the lashing out at people for no </v>

141
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy how many people do it.</v>

142
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 4>You'll see someone post something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone will be like,</v>

143
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You dumb piece of shit.</v>

144
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Don't you realize that this is why this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and why that any.</v>

145
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steven Kotler,</v>

146
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.540
<v Speaker 4>he's been on this show a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's awesome and they're doing these,</v>

147
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 4>doing this new psychedelic study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics and flow states.</v>

148
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Speaker 4>So I retweeted a tweet because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

149
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 4>they're doing research right now.</v>

150
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 4>They need people to fill out a survey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I retweeted that to help steven out.</v>

151
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.150
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

152
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

153
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:08.741
<v Speaker 4>that's a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think psychedelics probably do induce </v>

154
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 4>flow states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to find out for sure,</v>

155
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 4>but within like six comments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still up there if y'all want to </v>

156
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.091
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some dude wrote to me something on the </v>

157
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:21.971
<v Speaker 4>lines of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hurting people and don't even </v>

158
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 4>know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That six down.</v>

159
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like hurting people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what language he used,</v>

160
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck you.</v>

161
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 4>This is a survey dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you talking about?</v>

162
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 4>Like is it maybe he means by re tweeting</v>
<v Speaker 4>surveys,</v>

163
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 4>that sucks because no one wants to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that on their timeline,</v>

164
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:40.991
<v Speaker 4>but I think he meant you're hurting </v>
<v Speaker 4>people by demystifying and de </v>

165
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:47.231
<v Speaker 4>stigmatizing psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little do you know you're fighting cruel</v>

166
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 4>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Funding cruelty.</v>

167
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 4>I'll locally just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

168
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Because I want the explanation because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when someone says something </v>

169
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.721
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so terribly absolutely impossibly </v>

170
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 4>wrong from my reality tunnel that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I want to get narrow reality tunnel</v>

171
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 4>and here because that guy really that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>believes it well or he's a troll.</v>

172
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.680
<v Speaker 4>It could be he's a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be that each had terrible </v>

173
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 4>experiences with psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

174
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's one of those guys that had a </v>

175
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 4>real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

176
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.560
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people get really into something,</v>

177
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 4>they want everybody to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a terrible example that I'm telling </v>

178
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Into Yoga,</v>

179
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do yoga.</v>

180
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This happens with,</v>

181
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.920
<v Speaker 4>with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

182
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 4>and people that get sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people that have a real problem to </v>

183
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.371
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we all know someone who's gone off </v>

184
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:42.371
<v Speaker 4>the deep end with drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

185
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 4>When they come out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some folks turned into evangelists for </v>

186
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 4>sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

187
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.270
<v Speaker 4>and it gets super annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

188
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.400
<v Speaker 4>One of the things they do is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonize all positive experiences that </v>

189
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>we're with the</v>

190
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 5>same substances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their negative experience,</v>

191
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.140
<v Speaker 5>and they're fucking crazy head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've decided because they had a bad </v>

192
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 5>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every trip is bad.</v>

193
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 5>The millions of people tripping all over</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>

194
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.260
<v Speaker 5>taking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finding God and love and companionship </v>

195
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 5>and harmony with the universe and an </v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptance of their mortality.</v>

196
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420
<v Speaker 5>All that doesn't count because billy </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't keep his shit together at the </v>

197
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.110
<v Speaker 5>pink Floyd concert because this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>asshole decided to eat the entire,</v>

198
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 5>the entire bag of mushrooms and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>tripped his balls off and was screaming.</v>

199
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:33.681
<v Speaker 5>They had to take her to the hospital any</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he called his ex girlfriend and </v>

200
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 5>cried to her for hours and now her </v>
<v Speaker 5>boyfriend,</v>

201
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 5>a new boyfriend wants to beat him up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't even remember doing it.</v>

202
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy guy's an idiot.</v>

203
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of those people out there.</v>

204
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:47.651
<v Speaker 5>All lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a whole lot of them and there's people </v>

205
00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:49.040
<v Speaker 5>that just aren't geared for psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason.</v>

206
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are really,</v>

207
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.410
<v Speaker 5>really close to losing their shit with </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular reality.</v>

208
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:56.750
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For them it's not a good idea.</v>

209
00:09:56.751 --> 00:09:58.640
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

210
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely something that like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old age,</v>

211
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I want to put in like at Tallix and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying.</v>

212
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what you just said because when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was younger,</v>

213
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.610
<v Speaker 2>when you're younger and you are in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelical part of your psychedelic </v>

214
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.920
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can become like,</v>

215
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.010
<v Speaker 2>if you're not careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and irresponsible and you </v>

216
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.491
<v Speaker 2>start throwing out there this like idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not only fundamentally wrong,</v>

217
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally wrong in everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

218
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 2>which is there's not really a one cure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your troubles.</v>

219
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

220
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>but with psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think this is the answer,</v>

221
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 2>this is the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it,</v>

222
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 2>this is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

223
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of what some people need,</v>

224
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but if you've got manic depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

225
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.940
<v Speaker 2>if you've got bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.600
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this moment where this,</v>

227
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some parents came up to me and were dead</v>

228
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 2>tell you about this there.</v>

229
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 2>They came in to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a show and they were like talking</v>

230
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 2>about how their kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my podcast.</v>

231
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And it was really sad because he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been at one of my podcasts and I think </v>

232
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.040
<v Speaker 2>he'd come onstage as a question or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or,</v>

233
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and they were looking for a recording of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the live show because they thought maybe</v>

234
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Speaker 2>they could hear him talk or get some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as in laughter or something.</v>

235
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was he,</v>

236
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had some kind of.</v>

237
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what,</v>

238
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but he's one of my friends rave and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

239
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 2>is he uses the term gyro is gyro is off </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

240
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something was off a little bit.</v>

241
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.910
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid went and did Iowaska in Peru.</v>

242
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>He did a eight night or wanting to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're doing these.</v>

243
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they do it every night </v>
<v Speaker 2>or every other night,</v>

244
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>eight retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking</v>

245
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
<v Speaker 4>the medicine every night and then after </v>
<v Speaker 4>that went to some kind of like other </v>

246
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 4>shaman or some woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who it was,</v>

247
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:07.891
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure of the dates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he came home and he jumped off </v>

248
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:12.991
<v Speaker 4>a waterfall and killed himself because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what had happened is he a man,</v>

249
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 4>he was in a manic state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It triggered a manic state,</v>

250
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he killed himself and,</v>

251
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was Iowasca,</v>

252
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like the medicine,</v>

253
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

254
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:33.661
<v Speaker 4>and so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some reason I think some people are </v>

255
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 4>deemphasizing what it means to be healed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the psychedelic or to be worked on by</v>

256
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Speaker 4>a psychedelic or to enter into that </v>
<v Speaker 4>state because it's becoming,</v>

257
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 4>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a De stigmatized.</v>

258
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Much more so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember how it was 20 years ago?</v>

259
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

260
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't even talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't talk about it,</v>

261
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 4>couldn't mention it.</v>

262
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 4>It was you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bad,</v>

263
00:12:58.421 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad drugs.</v>

264
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It was heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on the same level as like you,</v>

265
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 4>if you were taking Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like heroin man,</v>

266
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 4>so people will look at you like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy and then there's also,</v>

267
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's real problems that people have </v>

268
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.731
<v Speaker 4>with being tested at work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people get tested at work and </v>

269
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 4>people worried about losing their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so drugs don't just become a thing where</v>

270
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 4>you could fuck up and you know and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to them,</v>

271
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 4>but now they become a thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>take away your livelihood,</v>

272
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 4>take away your livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

273
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:32.251
<v Speaker 4>Check your pee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put the state of paranoia on their </v>

274
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 4>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine that feeling.</v>

275
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 4>You're working for some office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You probably don't dig the GIG anyway,</v>

276
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even like it and they have to </v>

277
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 4>check your pass every now and then.</v>

278
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 4>That didn't only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when.</v>

312
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.850

<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

313
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:06.851

00:15:06.851 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 2>little bit and that's how they told </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's.</v>

00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to look at your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to.</v>

316
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:15.071

<v Speaker 2>they have to scan your ass in the print </v>

317

<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

319
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.920
<v Speaker 2>But also if you really think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that we are in a world where people</v>

320
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>have to go to work to do a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that by the way,</v>

321
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:34.691
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is a dude you need to get on </v>

322
00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:34.691
<v Speaker 2>this podcast and there's a book that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would love.</v>

323
00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 2>David Graber wrote this book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit Jobs.</v>

324
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a fucking genius man in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

325
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how many,</v>

326
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:51.131
<v Speaker 2>many people are working in jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything for the world or the </v>

327
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:55.961
<v Speaker 2>company they're working for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like this judgmental thing </v>

328
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:55.961
<v Speaker 2>where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

329
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a bullshit job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a blah,</v>

330
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

331
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like an anthropologist.</v>

332
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:05.111
<v Speaker 2>So he's very precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the qualifications for your </v>

333
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:08.261
<v Speaker 2>job to be a bullshit job is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's really kind of a worthless </v>

334
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really doing anything.</v>

335
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And like companies have gotten so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking big that,</v>

336
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

337
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>they end up having like departments or </v>
<v Speaker 2>people running departments or extra </v>

338
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.131
<v Speaker 2>employees that don't really need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there at all and they have to pretend to</v>

339
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work.</v>

340
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what he writes about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes it that if you really want to </v>

341
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.080
<v Speaker 2>torture a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 2>not only give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the job of like,</v>

343
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring a glass of water and an empty </v>

344
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.651
<v Speaker 2>glass and pouring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then add to it that they have to </v>

345
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:49.781
<v Speaker 2>deceive their boss into thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing an important job or they </v>

346
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Speaker 2>lose their jobs.</v>

347
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 2>So these not only are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some corporations and companies </v>

348
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.390
<v Speaker 2>scanning your pes to see if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a substance that is allowing you </v>

349
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 2>to connect with home what you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

350
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.600
<v Speaker 2>They are also demanding that you spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>many hours a day lying to them that </v>

351
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>you're doing work that you're not doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're fucking efficient,</v>

352
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is another thing I graybar </v>

353
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:21.880
<v Speaker 2>writes about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forgive me,</v>

354
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.031
<v Speaker 2>David Graver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if in any way I've misconstrued as I </v>

355
00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>read your writings stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

356
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

357
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

358
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other fucking element to it that is </v>

359
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 2>absolutely atrocious and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible is that these substances are </v>

360
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 2>connecting us to home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want us to be in those states</v>

361
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and they're asking us to fucking lie all</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

362
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.160
<v Speaker 2>And you know what psychedelic means?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

363
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the etymology of psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

364
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>it means mind manifesting or soul </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesting,</v>

365
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

366
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>So a psychedelic connects us potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the truth,</v>

367
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.580
<v Speaker 2>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our identity,</v>

368
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these companies,</v>

369
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 2>they're asking us to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the opposite of our identities,</v>

370
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 2>to wear weird a suit or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some kind of dress code.</v>

371
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 2>And to sit in a desk where because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're efficient,</v>

372
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 2>you get your job done in 45 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next six hours you got to sit </v>

373
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 2>and type in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend that you're working,</v>

374
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 2>knowing you're a person and knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like unethical,</v>

375
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

376
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>if you like go and tell your boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

377
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have much to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get fired.</v>

378
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.880
<v Speaker 2>The boss might like in the book he cites</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person because he did like a survey </v>

379
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 2>and he cites one person who went to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss and she's like,</v>

380
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can finish my job in two hours.</v>

381
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I have other stuff to do?</v>

382
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 2>And her boss is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about that.</v>

383
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Stay quiet about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>

384
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking world we're in right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because of automation.</v>

385
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 2>There's less to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Computers are making shit fat.</v>

386
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It's why are we were working the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same amount of time we were when there </v>

387
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 2>were no computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be there to get paid and</v>

388
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to act like you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or they can use.</v>

389
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people right now are doing just </v>

390
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 1>that while the list of this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

391
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to guess what percentage of </v>

392
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.831
<v Speaker 1>people are listening right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really supposed to be doing some </v>

393
00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:31.371
<v Speaker 1>bullshit job and they're kind of sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of their keyboard with earbuds </v>

394
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just barely paying attention.</v>

395
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Try not to get caught looking at porn.</v>

396
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably an all over the planet at </v>

397
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 2>over a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over a million in the work</v>

398
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.350
<v Speaker 1>forest probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you think companies had to put </v>

399
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.740
<v Speaker 1>in rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look at porn at work.</v>

400
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that wasn't a thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies who wasn't a thing in the </v>

401
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.020
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a thing in the nine,</v>

402
00:19:56.021 --> 00:20:01.021
<v Speaker 1>zero s then all the sudden you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just find porn online and people will.</v>

403
00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:05.000
<v Speaker 1>They have a work computer that's hooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the Internet.</v>

404
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Like when did the company start going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

405
00:20:07.701 --> 00:20:08.810
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

406
00:20:08.811 --> 00:20:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't look at that</v>

407
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I'm sure it started with like</v>

408
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Penthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

409
00:20:12.281 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Like even when they have penthouse </v>
<v Speaker 2>penthouse magazine,</v>

410
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:19.791
<v Speaker 2>like when you had fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know for sure you couldn't bring </v>

411
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>your pen out of your fucking hustler to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

412
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the but looking at something online </v>

413
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>is so much easier than going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>store and getting a hustler.</v>

414
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the access is universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous.</v>

415
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has the ability to just go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>download it,</v>

416
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to like ask questions </v>

417
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.001
<v Speaker 2>that are impossible to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people right now do you </v>

418
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:47.391
<v Speaker 2>think listening to the podcast or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their bullshit job jerking off to while </v>

419
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>they</v>

420
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 3>listened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least one dude.</v>

421
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.330
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

422
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what dudes do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

423
00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean because you can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They jerk off.</v>

424
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Especially a guy with a bad job who </v>
<v Speaker 3>could find a way to jerk off somewhere.</v>

425
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Let me just five minutes in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom with jerk off.</v>

426
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Just think about the stupid fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

427
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like sexual assault.</v>

428
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't think off in an office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In the what if you scream,</v>

429
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.770
<v Speaker 3>if everyone knows the going to go great.</v>

434
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>You work with some guy and he's like 300</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds and you're like 150 pounds and </v>

435
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:35.310
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

436
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I need to figure out how to fix this </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

437
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.080
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to unplug everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what?</v>

438
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

439

<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go in the bathroom.</v>

440
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I come I scream.</v>

441
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

442
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I even have to add the scream too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

443
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Santa for</v>

444
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.240

<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible prospect.</v>

445
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you consider like the act of </v>

446
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 2>shitting versus the act of jerking off </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like far more repulsive.</v>

447
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:07.231
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're expelling like foul smelling </v>

448
00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:09.440
<v Speaker 2>toxins from your body into the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say to your friend,</v>

449
00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

450
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.950

<v Speaker 2>your friends probably going to be like,</v>

451
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't need to tell me that.</v>

452
00:22:14.331 --> 00:22:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

453
00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

454
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.170
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your friend's not going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

456
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 2>And yet jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really if you think about it,</v>

457
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're giving yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hamish massage the end,</v>

458
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:30.320
<v Speaker 2>just like a little spray of like cream </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out it horrific.</v>

459
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what?</v>

460
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.100
<v Speaker 2>But in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

463
00:22:38.751 --> 00:22:39.350
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

464
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.580
<v Speaker 3>don't do it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

465
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm just picture John just with an itchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger finger just ready to reach into </v>

466
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>his pants.</v>

467
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no John.</v>

468
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.490
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do it again John?</v>

469
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a gross relationship that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worker has now with the corporation and </v>

470
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it's an unnatural relationship and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a relationship that seems to have like </v>

471
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 2>dehumanized people to the point of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatons that don't have a sex drive,</v>

472
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 2>that don't deserve to be able to explore</v>
<v Speaker 2>their consciousness.</v>

473
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is uh,</v>

474
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

475
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I'd already told me what he studied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Talmud and did it for like 12 hours a </v>

476
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.260
<v Speaker 3>day when he was a young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young man.</v>

477
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.570
<v Speaker 3>He told me that there was one passage </v>
<v Speaker 3>where in one of the ancient texts where </v>

478
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 3>it was talking about battling a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

479
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:46.290
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't make sense because </v>

480
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:46.290
<v Speaker 3>everything in here is supposed to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story that actually</v>

481
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this dragon?</v>

482
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Or The dragon is a metaphor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbation.</v>

483
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.830
<v Speaker 1>They tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dragon that takes away young </v>

484
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

485
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a metaphor for masturbation.</v>

486
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Dan talked about this on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

487
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

488
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Ari knows about as much as anyone you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to meet about Orthodox Jewish</v>

490
00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>traditions and the religion and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax.</v>

491
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:21.071
<v Speaker 1>He really did study that shit every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve hours a day for year in Israel,</v>

492
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he tells you about it and he got</v>

494
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:30.341
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got the actual translation of the </v>

495
00:24:30.341 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 1>metaphor from a guy who's a scholar.</v>

496
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

497
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad metaphor.</v>

498
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.620
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like if I wanted for whatever </v>

499
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:40.620
<v Speaker 2>reason to dissuade people from jerking </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

500
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I could come up with a way better like </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing than a dragon to represent it,</v>

501
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be some other thing like a,</v>

502
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

503
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:50.680
<v Speaker 2>like what's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

504
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be like the creature version </v>

505
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.310
<v Speaker 2>of a rolled up ball of dried come that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've thrown next to your bed and </v>

506
00:25:00.491 --> 00:25:05.491
<v Speaker 2>someone walks into your bedroom and sees</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rolled up ball of dried come clean x</v>

507
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:06.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>

508
00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:08.770
<v Speaker 2>You didn't clean up your common clean x.</v>

509
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It would be like one of them ghostbuster</v>
<v Speaker 1>villains,</v>

510
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of plasma thing that just </v>

511
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Jesus all over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:21.101
<v Speaker 1>they'd get ghostbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the Antifa </v>

513
00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>movement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti-Fat movement?</v>

514
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 1>FAP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fap.</v>

515
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

516
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 1>jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.100
<v Speaker 1>No fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not anti-fat and diagnosed at different.</v>

518
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

519
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Speaker 1>there's good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good thing is sex will be way more </v>

520
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.561
<v Speaker 1>pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad is it'll be way more desirable </v>

521
00:25:38.561 --> 00:25:42.970
<v Speaker 1>so like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mitigate your sexual urges so you </v>

522
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 1>don't do stupid things and hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with stupid people,</v>

523
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:51.150
<v Speaker 1>have sex with people you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like but you think are hot because </v>

524
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you're horny and they're willing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot of people they get,</v>

525
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.700
<v Speaker 1>they get wrapped up in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with these guys and gals </v>

526
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>that they're not really in love with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like to fuck,</v>

527
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

528
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

529
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.190
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about it?</v>

530
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there,</v>

531
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was something I always think back on is </v>

532
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.501
<v Speaker 2>when you were sponsored by fleshlight in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when we were doing the podcast </v>

533
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:22.611
<v Speaker 2>from your house and you'd come to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcast and you'd walk away with a </v>

534
00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:26.211
<v Speaker 2>flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up with like three or four </v>

535
00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:29.340
<v Speaker 2>flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like at first I just wanted like,</v>

536
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you had different types and at first I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just went for like,</v>

537
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.130
<v Speaker 2>oh the one that looks like a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

538
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.300
<v Speaker 2>But then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:26:36.301 --> 00:26:36.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

540
00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:41.841
<v Speaker 2>I got that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you have like one that was </v>

541
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:41.841
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

542
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:43.050
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some kind of like garlic oil alien.</v>

543
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It was really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fucking weird man.</v>

544
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:48.020
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

545
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I fuck those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

546
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

547
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:52.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

548
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 2>when I think back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the first time I did it,</v>

549
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it tricked my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second time or third time I did it,</v>

550
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:06.111
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't getting the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when I have sex with a human,</v>

551
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it's a completely </v>

552
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 2>different series of chemicals that must </v>
<v Speaker 2>be being released in my mind</v>

553
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.850
<v Speaker 1>uniting with someone you're bonding with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

554
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you certainly get the oxytocin from </v>
<v Speaker 1>orgasming together,</v>

555
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.130
<v Speaker 1>bonds people.</v>

556
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.880
<v Speaker 2>So I've always thought generally like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a period in my life,</v>

557
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.260
<v Speaker 2>arm jerk jerking awful lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like usually like there's something</v>

558
00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:36.950
<v Speaker 2>imbalanced in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't mean to apply like a sin to</v>

559
00:27:36.951 --> 00:27:39.410
<v Speaker 2>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like personally it feels</v>

560
00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:43.700
<v Speaker 2>a little dissipative when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a lot.</v>

561
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.590
<v Speaker 2>There is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

562
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.580
<v Speaker 1>that's completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the balance.</v>

563
00:27:48.581 --> 00:27:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But the balance is also like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to just be horny all the time.</v>

564
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you're hunting you make </v>

565
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Speaker 1>shitty decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you like,</v>

566
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll date someone just for sex.</v>

567
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you need to like.</v>

568
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that there is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be said for figuring out how to deal </v>

569
00:28:07.661 --> 00:28:10.060
<v Speaker 2>with like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of energy.</v>

570
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.240
<v Speaker 2>So that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an energetic state.</v>

571
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Like if suddenly you get being horny is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an energetic state.</v>

572
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's energy.</v>

573
00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're really horny and you sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like watch the,</v>

574
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.350
<v Speaker 2>the feeling itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's electrical.</v>

575
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.230
<v Speaker 2>You could feel it moving around in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

576
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can almost make a twitchy a little </v>

577
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.841
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like a very potent energetic </v>

578
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:37.201
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So theoretically instead of trying to </v>

579
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:42.001
<v Speaker 2>get the question would be rather is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there a way to release that energy that </v>

580
00:28:42.341 --> 00:28:45.370
<v Speaker 2>isn't through the tip of my Dick in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of DNA?</v>

581
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way for me to release that </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy in other ways or is the only way </v>

582
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the only valve on that to come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a question.</v>

583
00:28:54.641 --> 00:28:55.180
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

584
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there's this natural buildup </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

585
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It makes people more easily aroused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes people more concentrating on </v>

586
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 1>sex and I think that that can put you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of balance too.</v>

587
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You can be put out of balanced both by </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much masturbation.</v>

588
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:17.640
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely be put out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance by too much desire for sex.</v>

589
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just horny show you just </v>

590
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>take care of it yourself and you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>relieved and then you can think clearer.</v>

591
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the body needs a balance.</v>

592
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:32.091
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm a big proponent of </v>

593
00:29:32.091 --> 00:29:33.621
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big proponent of meditation and </v>

594
00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:34.060
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness and just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

595
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 1>That's all those are toxic words right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

596
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Meditation and mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

597
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 1>They've been thrown around by too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckleheads.</v>

598
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

599
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a bull shitty word.</v>

600
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 1>You kind of know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

601
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just all about mindfulness.</v>

602
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

603
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you're annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you are.</v>

604
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 1>The annoying guy.</v>

605
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

606
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I saw a book just yesterday and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these boutique stores,</v>

607
00:29:56.141 --> 00:30:00.020
<v Speaker 2>someone had made a star cast at kids but</v>
<v Speaker 2>called the grownups guide to mindfulness</v>

608
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.030
<v Speaker 2>and whoever wrote that fucking book </v>
<v Speaker 2>hates the word mindful.</v>

609
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Definitely has an obnoxious friend who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>into mindfulness because of the book is </v>

610
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.390
<v Speaker 2>just like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

611
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.270
<v Speaker 2>the guy doesn't seem to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what it is in the book.</v>

612
00:30:14.271 --> 00:30:19.271
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed a little confused about the </v>

613
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:19.271
<v Speaker 2>nature of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

614
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:19.880
<v Speaker 2>and I remember looking at that and been </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

615
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess people are getting annoyed with </v>

616
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.730
<v Speaker 2>the word mindfulness now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the pendulum swinging that way.</v>

617
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

618
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those words that people love</v>

619
00:30:29.311 --> 00:30:34.311
<v Speaker 1>to say it sounds good and it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like a spiritual person.</v>

620
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.420
<v Speaker 1>So it gets when it gets moved around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>used too much,</v>

621
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.940
<v Speaker 1>like something happens to where it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>icky.</v>

622
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like it becomes popular and</v>

623
00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:49.431
<v Speaker 1>then people start using it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see like a bunch of phony guru type </v>

624
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:51.630
<v Speaker 1>dudes at seminars using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's important here is mindfulness.</v>

625
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Very important that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:57.600
<v Speaker 1>there's like typically unique behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

627
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

628
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.720
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to like people </v>

629
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.320
<v Speaker 1>that are full of shit as like a typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniqueness.</v>

630
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just a thing that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people adopt and it sounds like everyone</v>

631
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:12.750
<v Speaker 1>else and it's just a way that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

632
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

633
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I hope you understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

634
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're adopting this weird,</v>

635
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:25.071
<v Speaker 1>funky thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important that we </v>

636
00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>practice mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It falls into that.</v>

637
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It falls into that even though it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent practice.</v>

638
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important,</v>

639
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 2>it's called in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

641
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now have,</v>

642
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I took on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>

643
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with a actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a teacher of the [inaudible] lineage of </v>

644
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is Chogyam.</v>

645
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Trungpa is lineage of Buddhism and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and he's,</v>

646
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and he's teaching me mindfulness </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation practice.</v>

647
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.010
<v Speaker 2>This Guy David nichtern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

648
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>how does he deal with masturbation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's cool about him is if you asked </v>

649
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd,</v>

650
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 2>he would tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's no like,</v>

651
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

652
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wouldn't be like,</v>

653
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:03.770
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

654
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you asked me that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that probably I don't,</v>

655
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would fall in line with what </v>

656
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you're saying with balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.850
<v Speaker 2>which is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really like a sort of the concept </v>

658
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:23.191
<v Speaker 2>with it is the thing that is happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

659
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just,</v>

660
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apply mindfulness to it.</v>

661
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:33.961
<v Speaker 2>You could apply like a being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and being with the thing that's </v>

662
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

663
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 2>the thing he's teaching me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it so much because it isn't,</v>

664
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:46.390
<v Speaker 6>we will we or like out there crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's literally this very simple way that</v>

665
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 6>you meditate with the way that you sit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is you sit on a cushion,</v>

666
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 6>you put your hands on your knees in and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you sit back and that he,</v>

667
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 6>the word they use in this Kagyu lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ford is the warrior pose.</v>

668
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 6>And what that means is that it's a kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of confidence.</v>

669
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 6>It's the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like people who are like confident sit.</v>

670
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 6>So you sit like that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>meditating,</v>

671
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:17.651
<v Speaker 6>you're legs are crossed and you sit in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>chair if you want and you look straight </v>

672
00:33:17.651 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 6>ahead about eight feet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nine feet,</v>

673
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 6>and you watch your breath and when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>go into your thoughts,</v>

674
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 6>which happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course you go,</v>

675
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 6>you think thinking and then you go back </v>
<v Speaker 6>to your breath.</v>

676
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say thinking,</v>

677
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.790
<v Speaker 6>you don't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think it.</v>

678
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 6>Thank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

679
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 6>Thinking just so [inaudible] what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's all these.</v>

680
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:44.321
<v Speaker 6>So like what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you start realizing when you start </v>

681
00:33:44.321 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 6>this practice and full disclosure here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

682
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:51.551
<v Speaker 6>you know me Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have problems with discipline and I </v>

683
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:54.071
<v Speaker 6>have problems with like sticking to </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff over and over again and working </v>

684
00:33:54.071 --> 00:33:55.210
<v Speaker 6>with this guy has been incredible </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's actually getting me to,</v>

685
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.320
<v Speaker 6>to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

686
00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 6>but still I have like I did it today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't do it yesterday.</v>

687
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:05.981
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get out there and some </v>

688
00:34:05.981 --> 00:34:06.630
<v Speaker 6>nonsense that I'm like spending all day </v>
<v Speaker 6>long meditating.</v>

689
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 6>But what you start seeing is when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it is you realize like,</v>

690
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.380
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a cycle happening in my </v>

691
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:17.380
<v Speaker 6>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In my mind,</v>

692
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 6>there's a cycle that's happening in my </v>
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

693
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Speaker 6>which is that I kind of blink into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment following the breath and I blink </v>

694
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 6>out of the moment into the thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>realm,</v>

695
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

696
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 6>We're like little fireflies wee flicker </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the moment.</v>

697
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:30.530
<v Speaker 6>We're here now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're here,</v>

698
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:35.531
<v Speaker 6>we're not lost in our thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not thinking about the next thing </v>

699
00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:38.411
<v Speaker 6>we're going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not thinking about the next thing </v>

700
00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:38.411
<v Speaker 6>we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're just here in this moment.</v>

701
00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 6>And then we're off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

702
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 6>often running,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like thinking about the bills,</v>

703
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 6>forget about the girl thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

704
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.840
<v Speaker 6>thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that leads to another thought </v>

705
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:49.840
<v Speaker 6>and another thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Next thing you know,</v>

706
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 6>you've been thinking for three years </v>
<v Speaker 6>straight,</v>

707
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or three minutes or five hours or </v>

708
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.641
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you come back and that's the </v>

709
00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 6>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a cycle that happens.</v>

710
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:06.161
<v Speaker 6>So mindfulness is starting to pay </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention and,</v>

711
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.680
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

712
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 6>and to that cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

713
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:15.070
<v Speaker 6>and the breathing thing is kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a respiratory mnemonic device,</v>

714
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.100
<v Speaker 6>which is that suddenly what's been </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening to me now is I'll just be like</v>

715
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 6>walking down the street in the notice my</v>
<v Speaker 6>breath.</v>

716
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.080
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm back.</v>

717
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm here.</v>

718
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 6>I was totally over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

719
00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was thinking,</v>

720
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all.</v>

721
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

722
00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:40.001
<v Speaker 6>very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he's just teaching me the basic </v>

723
00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:40.001
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

724
00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:40.001
<v Speaker 6>I</v>

725
00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 5>think it pretty interesting on my own </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about my own life and observing</v>

726
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:47.211
<v Speaker 5>other people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've come up with this thing that I </v>

727
00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.830
<v Speaker 5>bring up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The momentum of your past like your,</v>

728
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like so many people as they're going </v>

729
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.961
<v Speaker 5>down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many people as they're interacting </v>

730
00:35:56.961 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 5>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're carrying the momentum of all the</v>

731
00:35:57.481 --> 00:36:02.481
<v Speaker 5>fucked up things that are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bills that they have to pay and things </v>

732
00:36:02.481 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 5>that they forgot to do and a career they</v>
<v Speaker 5>never chase.</v>

733
00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 5>And a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they never called back.</v>

734
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:11.691
<v Speaker 5>And the thing that they lied about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a thing they stole and the reason why </v>

735
00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:12.670
<v Speaker 5>they got fired from work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe if I call my boss,</v>

736
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 5>I'll get my and all this craziness </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're bringing with you into everything</v>

737
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:21.570
<v Speaker 5>that is so hard to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard for people to escape the </v>

738
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:21.570
<v Speaker 5>momentum of the past.</v>

739
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people sort of get into this thing of </v>

740
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 5>defining themselves by failures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by past failures.</v>

741
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 5>And it never just learning from them go </v>
<v Speaker 5>on that fucking loser.</v>

742
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real problem with people to be </v>

743
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.680
<v Speaker 5>able to learn from something and to just</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at yourself.</v>

744
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.920
<v Speaker 5>And it's painful to look at yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So everybody wants to pretend that they </v>

745
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.130
<v Speaker 5>didn't do anything wrong right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody else is an asshole and that.</v>

746
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when you're doing what you're </v>

747
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 5>doing by doing that is you're stunting </v>
<v Speaker 5>your own growth.</v>

748
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:53.850
<v Speaker 5>You feel like you're protecting yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're protecting your ego.</v>

749
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.670
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

750
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck him.</v>

751
00:36:56.641 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 5>He's the asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

752
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 5>you could've avoided that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

753
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:05.061
<v Speaker 5>you could've done better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody has moments like that in </v>

754
00:37:05.061 --> 00:37:08.451
<v Speaker 5>their life and the more you avoid those </v>
<v Speaker 5>and don't take credit for the ones that </v>

755
00:37:08.451 --> 00:37:12.051
<v Speaker 5>you actually fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you actually hurt yourself in </v>

756
00:37:12.051 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 5>this ironic thing because it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're protecting yourself.</v>

757
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 5>Know your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm exonerating myself from guilt as </v>

758
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't me.</v>

759
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't do it,</v>

760
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.660
<v Speaker 5>but you know you did so in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the guy who lies about making </v>

761
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 5>mistakes instead of you're the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>mans up to your mistakes and realizes it</v>

762
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 5>was a mistake and then vows to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

763
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

764
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 5>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's beautiful.</v>

765
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 5>You have to just have to be able to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're wrong.</v>

766
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

767
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.240
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you got to be able to look at </v>

768
00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 5>yourself like all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you've just,</v>

769
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:43.680
<v Speaker 5>when you fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can avoid some of those fuck</v>

770
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:48.681
<v Speaker 5>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look at yourself critically along </v>

771
00:37:48.681 --> 00:37:50.931
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we all have to understand that </v>

772
00:37:50.931 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are all in evolving process.</v>

773
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.910
<v Speaker 5>Like I had this conversation with Dennis</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mckenna.</v>

774
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy conversation because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous thing to say,</v>

775
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.630
<v Speaker 5>but he was talking about a Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was saying,</v>

776
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 5>d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it possible that he could grow and</v>

777
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 5>learn?</v>

778
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Like why do we give up on people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does a guy get to a certain age and </v>

779
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 5>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

780
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 5>he's 60.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He set in his ways.</v>

781
00:38:11.341 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 5>He's 70.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll never change.</v>

782
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:17.871
<v Speaker 5>You'll never evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't ever say that about a 20 year </v>

783
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:20.721
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see some asshole who's a 20 year </v>

784
00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:22.431
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he just needs discipline and </v>

785
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:25.280
<v Speaker 5>just needs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Love finds the right pr people in his </v>

786
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.280
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right person to love.</v>

787
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.660
<v Speaker 5>He'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna mature and eventually he's </v>

788
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:29.660
<v Speaker 5>going to be a solid man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get to a certain age.</v>

789
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 5>We just give up on you just like you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>still alive,</v>

790
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:37.221
<v Speaker 5>but you've passed the cycle that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>usually people to be ready to sort of </v>

791
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 5>interact as valuable creative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loving members of society.</v>

792
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Pass that by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're still thinking about yourself.</v>

793
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 5>Only deepen your sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is stupid shit.</v>

794
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 5>This is shit you're supposed to do when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're 17.</v>

795
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 5>By the time you're 70,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to be going,</v>

796
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have much time left.</v>

797
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what have I done while I'm here?</v>

798
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:57.430
<v Speaker 5>What do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it important?</v>

799
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:02.431
<v Speaker 5>What do I feel the best about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel the best about love and </v>

800
00:39:02.431 --> 00:39:05.401
<v Speaker 5>companionship and friendship and real </v>
<v Speaker 5>warmth and interaction between people </v>

801
00:39:05.401 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 5>that you care about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This money thing,</v>

802
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not.</v>

803
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep chasing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't keep chasing power.</v>

804
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 5>Can't keep chasing money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna.</v>

805
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 5>Reach a point where it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter because you're going to die,</v>

806
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.430
<v Speaker 5>so you really want to be that guy from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bumper sticker.</v>

807
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:23.431
<v Speaker 5>He who dies with the most toys wins </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is literally what you're </v>

808
00:39:23.431 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 5>working towards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're working towards a joke.</v>

809
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I will let.</v>

810
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 6>Can I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One thing I would add to that is that,</v>

811
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 6>so what you're saying here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're.</v>

812
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:36.750
<v Speaker 6>You're right man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the one thing I think I disagree </v>

813
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 6>with you on is that you're creating a </v>
<v Speaker 6>situation where that's it.</v>

814
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:44.910
<v Speaker 6>You die and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The momentum smack the momentum goes </v>

815
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 6>into a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's gone.</v>

816
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.520
<v Speaker 6>Like the momentum has been like as </v>
<v Speaker 6>disintegrates vanishes,</v>

817
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 6>that momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

818
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 6>But the way I've been taught is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually that momentum keeps going.</v>

819
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 6>That momentum doesn't just stop because </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body stops,</v>

820
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that momentum keeps going and in fact</v>

821
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.970
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's really beautiful is like.</v>

822
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 6>And it's good that you call it momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly what it is,</v>

823
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 6>what it feels like with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a tendency,</v>

824
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.990
<v Speaker 6>we have a tendency towards a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

825
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:15.991
<v Speaker 6>We have proclivities and tendencies and </v>
<v Speaker 6>habituation and if you just kind of </v>

826
00:40:15.991 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you put you in me in a room and put a</v>

827
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 6>bunch of different objects on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

828
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna go toward something and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to go towards something else,</v>

829
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

830
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:31.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there's fucking vr goggles and a in </v>

831
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.170
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a God damn bad ass,</v>

832
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.641
<v Speaker 6>like some kind of like bad ass compound </v>
<v Speaker 6>bow manufactured it fucking Darpa.</v>

833
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:42.210
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's vr goggles manufactured by </v>

834
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.210
<v Speaker 6>Darpa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

835
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.871
<v Speaker 6>I'm going for the VR goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're probably going to go for the </v>

836
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:45.871
<v Speaker 6>cross or the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

837
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 6>So we have proclivities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have.</v>

838
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 6>That's the momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

839
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 6>That is one way you can understand what </v>
<v Speaker 6>Karma is,</v>

840
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.960
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the momentum.</v>

841
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 6>That's the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that thing that you've got right now,</v>

842
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 6>when you begin to really look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>think about it,</v>

843
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 6>you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when did this start?</v>

844
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 6>This momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

845
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:09.601
<v Speaker 6>When did this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these proclivities and tendencies and </v>

846
00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:11.230
<v Speaker 6>things that I'm being like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pushed towards.</v>

847
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:16.231
<v Speaker 6>When did they start in?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of it is your parents taught you </v>

848
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:16.231
<v Speaker 6>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

849
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:21.080
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about a super common one </v>

850
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:21.080
<v Speaker 5>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cigarettes you,</v>

851
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.430
<v Speaker 5>you got cooked by that bug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are He got hooked by that bug?</v>

852
00:41:23.431 --> 00:41:26.430
<v Speaker 5>Red Band still hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz kicked it.</v>

853
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.350
<v Speaker 5>You know that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really,</v>

854
00:41:28.351 --> 00:41:30.420
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really common one.</v>

855
00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:35.421
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sorta defines people on that guy </v>

856
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:35.421
<v Speaker 5>who I'm</v>

857
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>going to walk into this store and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though I know these things cause cancer,</v>

858
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy a pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go outside and I can't wait to</v>

859
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>light it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not even thinking about that </v>

860
00:41:44.861 --> 00:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

861
00:41:44.861 --> 00:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get that thing in your mouth.</v>

862
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you take that drag and you feel that</v>

863
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 1>cancer causing chemical rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

864
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it,</v>

865
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm alright today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cancer.</v>

866
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>You take a big deep breath in and blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

867
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the other fellow cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>dodgers and they're just looking at Jill</v>

868
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:06.710
<v Speaker 1>and smoking together and everybody just </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at dodging cancer.</v>

869
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

870
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 6>another one way you could actually say </v>
<v Speaker 6>it is like every time you do that you're</v>

871
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 6>planting a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So every time you smoke a cigarette,</v>

872
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 6>you could imagine that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 6>field right in the field is your health.</v>

873
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 6>And in that field,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anytime you like exercise or do </v>

874
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

875
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 6>decide instead of eating the fucking ice</v>
<v Speaker 6>cream you're going to eat.</v>

876
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 6>The seaweed chips are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anytime you do that,</v>

877
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 6>you could just imagine obviously it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not the way it works exactly.</v>

878
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 6>But you could think I'm planting a seed </v>
<v Speaker 6>in this field,</v>

879
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.380
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if I keep planning certain types of </v>

880
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 6>seeds and any type of field and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultivate those seeds,</v>

881
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 6>they're going to grow into something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

882
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.030
<v Speaker 6>That's Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what,</v>

883
00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you know for a person,</v>

884
00:42:48.761 --> 00:42:52.150
<v Speaker 6>when the cancer comes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the muscles come,</v>

885
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.390
<v Speaker 6>when the failure comes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the success comes,</v>

886
00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:00.990
<v Speaker 6>if you look at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you realized this is actually the </v>

887
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.921
<v Speaker 6>flowering of a thing that's been growing</v>
<v Speaker 6>for a very long time inside of me or in </v>

888
00:43:05.261 --> 00:43:10.261
<v Speaker 6>the world or in time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the idea people already have </v>

889
00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:12.940
<v Speaker 6>within them planted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of these seeds haven't,</v>

890
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.260
<v Speaker 6>haven't been expressed yet into time </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're still inside of them.</v>

891
00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:22.261
<v Speaker 6>Like the dude with the like imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy with the guy who shot the guy </v>

892
00:43:22.261 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 6>because he had road rage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

893
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:29.490
<v Speaker 6>that guy for years had a really bad </v>
<v Speaker 6>anger disorder and he knew it.</v>

894
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.220
<v Speaker 6>He would look.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He would think at times in this very </v>

895
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.370
<v Speaker 6>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get really angry all the time.</v>

896
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if this is normal,</v>

897
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people were beaten when </v>

898
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 1>they were kids.</v>

899
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 6>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

900
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

901
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 6>Common Super Common Trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah man,</v>

902
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.660
<v Speaker 6>that's like cigarette smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any kind of behavior that like is risky </v>

903
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:57.700
<v Speaker 6>or over time produces some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>negative result.</v>

904
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.570
<v Speaker 6>It's just planting seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

905
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.620
<v Speaker 6>and so the momentum you're experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now is the sum total of all those </v>

906
00:44:05.781 --> 00:44:10.781
<v Speaker 6>fucking seeds that you planted and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>were planted inside of you over the </v>

907
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 6>course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're,</v>

908
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.860
<v Speaker 6>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like a walking field of Karma at </v>

909
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.671
<v Speaker 6>varying stages of growth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>growing varying types of vegetation and </v>

910
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:27.370
<v Speaker 6>some are good and some are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like that's what you are right </v>

911
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:31.390
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what's beautiful about that is that </v>

912
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 6>means that you can start cultivating </v>
<v Speaker 6>field.</v>

913
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to just like let it grow </v>

914
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.711
<v Speaker 2>wild and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pretend every time you smoke a </v>

915
00:44:39.711 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 2>cigarette or do some stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like an unconscious farmer.</v>

916
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.660
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>

917
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.530
<v Speaker 7>I'm drinking and driving again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I got to get home.</v>

918
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.630
<v Speaker 7>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

919
00:44:52.631 --> 00:44:57.010
<v Speaker 7>The Dui plant grew again in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder why that thing keeps growing in</v>

920
00:44:57.011 --> 00:45:01.520
<v Speaker 7>my field.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You keep fucking drinking and driving,</v>

921
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dui play out.</v>

922
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

923
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can cultivate it.</v>

925
00:45:07.701 --> 00:45:09.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what's beautiful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

926
00:45:09.261 --> 00:45:14.261
<v Speaker 2>you can cultivate the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to let it just have </v>

927
00:45:14.261 --> 00:45:17.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking weird random weeds spring up </v>
<v Speaker 2>though when a patch or to have some </v>

928
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:17.780
<v Speaker 2>weeds because those are fun.</v>

929
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Imagine spending that tobacco money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending that money thinking about all </v>

930
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:25.930
<v Speaker 3>that cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spending all that money.</v>

931
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 3>God just buying a big castle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What all that cancer money.</v>

932

00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:33.610
<v Speaker 3>the people want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want it.</v>

934
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Yet in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the freedom to buy whatever </v>

935
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

936
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

937
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:39.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a person's choice,</v>

938
00:45:39.011 --> 00:45:44.011
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to get back to what you were just </v>

939
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:44.011
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethics of the fucking day.</v>

940
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:47.240
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people who run big tobacco own </v>

941
00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 2>stock in companies that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemotherapy drugs?</v>

942
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.080
<v Speaker 2>There is a big question like how many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people in their portfolio that </v>

943
00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 2>they barely know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

944
00:45:58.081 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

945
00:45:58.651 --> 00:46:03.651
<v Speaker 2>like a really big investment these days </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a k gene therapy for cancer.</v>

946
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Really</v>

947
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.170
<v Speaker 7>cancer out of hand these days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

948
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what could be going wrong.</v>

949
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.720
<v Speaker 2>The problem with cigarettes is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're addictive.</v>

950
00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Will just kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

951
00:46:16.871 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but that they're addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

952
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I've smoked a cigarette before and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a head rush.</v>

953
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't like a nice little weird rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

954
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 2>And also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other problem is nicotine is a </v>

955
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.420
<v Speaker 2>madison and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has like some health benefits if </v>

956
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.080
<v Speaker 2>used in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it's a nootropic so yeah,</v>

957
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just like it gives you a rush.</v>

958
00:46:37.631 --> 00:46:42.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit.</v>

959
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Steven King said that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult things when he quit </v>

960
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.760
<v Speaker 3>smoking was not having one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

961
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

962
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

963
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the nature of addiction.</v>

964
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like Kudzu dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did trees.</v>

965
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 2>It wraps around your favorite thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and tricks you ended Kudzu.</v>

966
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Kudzu is a plant that was introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Japan and I think from Japan into </v>

967
00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.351
<v Speaker 2>the south and it's just a growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We vine that when it wraps around trees </v>

968
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:17.390
<v Speaker 2>and it covers them up completely so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees can't get any sun and the trees </v>

969
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 2>just die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

970
00:47:17.491 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't native to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes,</v>

971
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they took care of Gutsy,</v>

972
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:26.881
<v Speaker 2>but when I was a kid you would drive by </v>
<v Speaker 2>these beautiful forests that were where </v>

973
00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:28.490
<v Speaker 2>the trees were just covered in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking cuts it.</v>

974
00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

975
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

976
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like they got eaten other plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right,</v>

977
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those trees are dying.</v>

978
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 4>They can't get the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

979
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

980
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.620
<v Speaker 4>And that's a great metaphor for </v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction or for [inaudible] is a </v>

981
00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.000
<v Speaker 4>perfect metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

982
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 4>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

983
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:52.650

<v Speaker 4>It's definitely seems like something </v>

1024
00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:22.711
<v Speaker 4>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like alcoholics,</v>

1025
00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:27.121
<v Speaker 4>they'll get their alcoholism wound up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their social life or like their </v>

1026
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 4>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their creative cycle,</v>

00:49:36.211 --> 00:49:37.030
<v Speaker 4>write as well or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

1030
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.200

<v Speaker 4>it's just people who have this a really </v>

1031
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.861
<v Speaker 4>smart way to avoid getting healthier or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the learning curve associated with </v>

1032
00:49:47.831 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 4>getting healthier and it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent trick to play on yourself,</v>

1033
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do imagine that,</v>

1034
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:59.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it may be that's currently out </v>

1035
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 4>of balance in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you remove that,</v>

1037
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:07.530
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of alcoholics out there </v>

1038
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:07.530
<v Speaker 4>who are performers who think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1039
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:12.391
<v Speaker 4>if I don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to have a beer on stage man or </v>

1040
00:50:12.391 --> 00:50:16.780
<v Speaker 4>early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where it gets hard core is when it's </v>

1041
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.771
<v Speaker 4>like actually fucking wrapped up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>art publicly.</v>

1042
00:50:20.201 --> 00:50:25.201
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're aware of this </v>

1043
00:50:25.201 --> 00:50:26.230
<v Speaker 4>rapper who died named Lil peep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1044
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>about little peep I heard about him.</v>

1045
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of his videos that just shows </v>

1046
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor of his car,</v>

1047
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the f just pill bottles scattered </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1048
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like part of the identity,</v>

1049
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:43.331
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was projecting into the world </v>

1050
00:50:43.331 --> 00:50:45.640
<v Speaker 2>involved like the Romanticization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction to pharmaceutical medications.</v>

1051
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's where it gets real.</v>

1052
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Or like big comics when all their jokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are about being fat and if they.</v>

1053
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't only have to like,</v>

1054
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 2>worry about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:05.111
<v Speaker 2>being fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to worry about if I got </v>

1056
00:51:05.111 --> 00:51:07.271
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if my jokes are gonna work </v>

1057
00:51:07.271 --> 00:51:07.271
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what I mean?</v>

1058
00:51:07.271 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how insidious it can get,</v>

1059
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1061
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one does creep in.</v>

1062
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I actually heard Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard someone say that to him,</v>

1063
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're losing roles.</v>

1064
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone just told me,</v>

1065
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:24.521
<v Speaker 2>it's like you either need to lose 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds or gain 15 pounds if you want to </v>

1066
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:28.720
<v Speaker 2>get in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember he said that,</v>

1067
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1068
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1069
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1070
00:51:31.651 --> 00:51:36.651
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become this character or something </v>

1071
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:38.981
<v Speaker 2>like that in the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking addiction is just riding </v>

1072
00:51:38.981 --> 00:51:43.631
<v Speaker 2>you around like a horse whispering in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ear without me will know where to </v>

1073
00:51:43.631 --> 00:51:45.940
<v Speaker 2>go and now you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>

1074
00:51:45.941 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm your comfort blanket.</v>

1075
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you're all alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're drinking alone in your hotel</v>

1077
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:52.600
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1078
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dark.</v>

1079
00:51:55.611 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 2>But then when you get into it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're not just drinking alone,</v>

1080
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.810
<v Speaker 2>but you're like telling stories to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1081
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.540
<v Speaker 2>celebrating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pretending.</v>

1082
00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you find yourself pretending </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking hunter.</v>

1083
00:52:07.561 --> 00:52:10.870
<v Speaker 2>S Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>

1084
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.180
<v Speaker 2>get a cigarette holder unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing like him.</v>

1085
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.590
<v Speaker 2>You ain't hunter s Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1086
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.770
<v Speaker 2>You're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

1087
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.320
<v Speaker 2>But I know in my life like the Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've been like,</v>

1088
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.450
<v Speaker 2>it's of like a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s Thompson.</v>

1089
00:52:24.451 --> 00:52:25.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1090
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:27.130
<v Speaker 2>you need to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Like stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like you,</v>

1092
00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:29.550
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1093
00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:31.050
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tricking yourself.</v>

1094
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1095
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll just don't trick yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1096
00:52:33.991 --> 00:52:37.290
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a self destructive </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic,</v>

1097
00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:39.390
<v Speaker 2>drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1098
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:45.110
<v Speaker 2>be that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't fool yourself into thinking </v>

1099
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.320
<v Speaker 2>that's not what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's romantic.</v>

1100
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1101
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't like as your plummeting towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>splattering all over the fucking ground.</v>

1102
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Pretend that you're flying towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1103
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could.</v>

1104
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's actually a cool way to tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way to think</v>

1105
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.270
<v Speaker 1>right before impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the water tower.</v>

1106
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>God did.</v>

1107
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1108
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe so</v>

1109
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:10.650
<v Speaker 1>in who knows what you see when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight days of Iowasca who know what you </v>

1110
00:53:12.941 --> 00:53:15.790
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like eight days of any potent</v>

1111
00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:17.560
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done that.</v>

1112
00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never done more than one day in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

1113
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I've done one day in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a break,</v>

1114
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little pot the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I don't do anything for like </v>

1115
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1116
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:31.670
<v Speaker 6>That's how I've always done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never done like a big session </v>

1117
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.260
<v Speaker 6>followed by big session.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:34.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

1119
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:39.921
<v Speaker 6>We can only speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know exactly what that would be </v>

1120
00:53:39.921 --> 00:53:39.921
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1121
00:53:39.921 --> 00:53:40.650
<v Speaker 6>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't imagine.</v>

1122
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this crazy idea,</v>

1123
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 6>crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now this is a lens,</v>

1124
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but obviously it's probably not true,</v>

1125
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:53.370
<v Speaker 6>but I got this crazy idea that like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

1126
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:58.371
<v Speaker 6>like this with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could just say this and I don't have </v>

1127
00:53:58.371 --> 00:53:59.090
<v Speaker 6>to preface it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but since people isn't your podcasts,</v>

1128
00:53:59.091 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 6>I have to preface it by saying I do not </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe this.</v>

1129
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going insane,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is a fun thing to think about.</v>

1130
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.140
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's okay to imagine shit in your mind.</v>

1131
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 6>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can imagine stuff.</v>

1132
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 6>But.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was thinking like inspiration,</v>

1133
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.830
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1134
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 6>Specifically I was thinking like Jr </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tolkien when you read Lord of the Rings,</v>

1135
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 6>it's like that guy went over there that </v>
<v Speaker 6>writing is so beautiful and so perfect.</v>

1136
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:30.910
<v Speaker 6>And so like interdimensional extra </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimension old.</v>

1137
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking old book and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>beautiful.</v>

1138
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:35.140
<v Speaker 6>His writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:40.420
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh that guy token that inspiration is </v>

1140
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 6>outflow from the DMT realm into this </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimension through the,</v>

1141
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:50.810
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>through the processor of his meat </v>

1142
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.291
<v Speaker 6>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is like a kind of drip coming </v>

1143
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.591
<v Speaker 6>out of a dam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The dam is something that's been </v>

1144
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:02.961
<v Speaker 6>constructed by power structures who want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to keep that realm out of here.</v>

1145
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.580
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so over there you get usually a kind</v>

1146
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 6>of message,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1147
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:13.110
<v Speaker 6>And the message is usually something </v>
<v Speaker 6>along the lines of,</v>

1148
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 6>we need to love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can love each other here.</v>

1149
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 6>There's something more important than </v>
<v Speaker 6>money,</v>

1150
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to really be very reductive about it,</v>

1151
00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:29.871
<v Speaker 6>but some version of that story that </v>
<v Speaker 6>usually involves some kind of desire to </v>

1152
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:36.291
<v Speaker 6>no longer harm people or to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 6>suffering or to be a better person or </v>

1153
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:36.291
<v Speaker 6>however you want to put it.</v>

1154
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:40.940
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's a dam that's been built and </v>

1155
00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.591
<v Speaker 6>the dam is built by the people who scan </v>
<v Speaker 6>your pis for Lsd.</v>

1156
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.580
<v Speaker 6>It's people who have created an </v>
<v Speaker 6>intentional legal obstruction between </v>

1157
00:55:54.271 --> 00:55:59.271
<v Speaker 6>one realm and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the realm mechanical hyperspace</v>

1158
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.770
<v Speaker 6>in the realm that we're currently </v>
<v Speaker 6>existing in,</v>

1159
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 6>which is where there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>scientific materialism where people only</v>

1160
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:08.730
<v Speaker 6>believe that there is only matter here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's only matter.</v>

1161
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing else.</v>

1162
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 6>No spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no soul,</v>

1163
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:14.300
<v Speaker 6>right gatekeepers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The gatekeepers I,</v>

1164
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 6>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to think of them as gatekeepers.</v>

1165
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.750
<v Speaker 6>Now I think of them as dam builders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>builders,</v>

1166
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:23.810
<v Speaker 6>and what happens is from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a big crack in the dam opens up,</v>

1167
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.160
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when someone like fucking Martin </v>

1168
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.880
<v Speaker 6>Luther King appears in his standing in </v>
<v Speaker 6>front of so many people telling them.</v>

1169
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:40.020
<v Speaker 6>I think that we're all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is what I think.</v>

1170
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 6>I think we're all the same and he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it in this very charismatic,</v>

1171
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:45.820
<v Speaker 6>beautiful way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1172
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.720
<v Speaker 6>That's a big fucking crack in the dam </v>
<v Speaker 6>because over on this side of things,</v>

1173
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:57.090
<v Speaker 6>they don't want us to be all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want us to be separated by a lot of</v>

1174
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:02.791
<v Speaker 6>different fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want us to be all the same </v>

1175
00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:05.311
<v Speaker 6>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the cracks in the dam opened up and </v>

1176
00:57:05.311 --> 00:57:05.311
<v Speaker 6>the big cracks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bam.</v>

1177
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:08.580
<v Speaker 6>The little cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like the good art,</v>

1178
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:11.160
<v Speaker 6>the good poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the great movies,</v>

1179
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 6>the good inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and now what's happening because of the </v>

1180
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.520
<v Speaker 6>fucking Internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1181
00:57:17.521 --> 00:57:20.280
<v Speaker 6>these fucking cracks in the dam or </v>
<v Speaker 6>opening up.</v>

1182
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:25.490
<v Speaker 6>They can't seal them up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you can't see all the fucking </v>

1183
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.611
<v Speaker 6>damn anymore in the singularity that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Mckenna was talking about the </v>

1184
00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:32.691
<v Speaker 6>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which actually means lifting of the </v>

1185
00:57:32.691 --> 00:57:32.691
<v Speaker 6>veil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did that is,</v>

1186
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.760
<v Speaker 6>is when the dam reaches a point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>the structural integrity has been </v>

1187
00:57:38.191 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 6>permanently compromised in the DMT </v>
<v Speaker 6>realm,</v>

1188
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:46.310
<v Speaker 6>flows into this dimension in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 6>some kind of technology that either </v>

1189
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:52.550
<v Speaker 6>unifies all of us are like rips a hole </v>
<v Speaker 6>literally into whatever that membrane is</v>

1190
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:58.410
<v Speaker 6>that separates us from the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that is what for whatever reason,</v>

1191
00:57:58.771 --> 00:58:02.130
<v Speaker 6>over in this dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people have been trying to stop so</v>

1192
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.240
<v Speaker 4>because it impedes progress in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like making money.</v>

1193
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:11.010
<v Speaker 4>We're building businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be building businesses if </v>

1194
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.380
<v Speaker 4>people were doing lsd on their brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>

1195
00:58:12.381 --> 00:58:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I think you could run a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

1196
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:14.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1197
00:58:14.271 --> 00:58:19.271
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to come back and they're </v>

1198
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:19.271
<v Speaker 4>not going to be concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 4>productivity.</v>

1199
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:19.271
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to be.</v>

1200
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:19.271
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1201
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:20.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we get a group of people together and</v>

1202
00:58:20.841 --> 00:58:23.720
<v Speaker 4>start building something amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not for money.</v>

1203
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just being facetious.</v>

1204
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Certainly can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1205
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm arguing with the devil's advocate.</v>

1206
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1207
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Let me play the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1208
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.340
<v Speaker 4>nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>

1209
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.120
<v Speaker 4>can I have my soul back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1210
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole thing of you exploring hyper </v>

1211
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.911
<v Speaker 4>dimensional space and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that does is make you stupider and </v>

1212
00:58:44.911 --> 00:58:49.471
<v Speaker 4>you show up at work and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're less disciplined and you're not </v>

1213
00:58:49.471 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 4>interested in getting the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1214
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 4>This company is built on teamwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1215
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:55.540
<v Speaker 4>And it's built on everyone pulling their</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

1216
00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.720
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're off fucking off in hyperspace </v>

1217
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.900
<v Speaker 4>from Friday night to Sunday morning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you barely get six hours sleep over the </v>

1218
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 4>weekend and you show up Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to test your pis.</v>

1219
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and if I find silicide been in there or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else fucking squirrely.</v>

1221
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Do you mind if I show you David Nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Professor David Nutt,</v>

1222
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:19.850
<v Speaker 4>study on the landsat about the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the variety of drugs I,</v>

1223
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>I'd like I'm talking to the devil here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do</v>

1224
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 6>you mind if I show you this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because if you notice sir,</v>

1225
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:30.160
<v Speaker 6>on this chart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they again published in the landsat is </v>

1226
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 6>peer reviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a very important study,</v>

1227
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 6>Professor David Knight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course,</v>

1228
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:37.931
<v Speaker 6>has since been disbarred and somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>and accrued some kind of horrible </v>

1229
00:59:37.931 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 6>punishment for being an advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics.</v>

1230
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.760
<v Speaker 6>forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you'll,</v>

1232
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:47.830
<v Speaker 6>you'll notice on this chart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>psilocybin is considered the least </v>

1233
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 6>harmful of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All three candidates</v>

1234
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:52.260
<v Speaker 5>interested in harmful.</v>

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want this place to run fast.</v>

1236
00:59:57.181 --> 00:59:59.880
<v Speaker 5>We're in competition and we're losing </v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs overseas.</v>

1237
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000

<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well here's the problem sir.</v>

1261
01:00:56.031 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 6>You don't realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're kind of a low level priest in</v>

1262
01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:05.621
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a religion that is spread far and </v>

1263
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 6>wide and in this religion it's not </v>
<v Speaker 6>really the,</v>

1264
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.880
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the money that you're interested in as </v>

1265
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.461
<v Speaker 6>much as it is the power because you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>become a servant of a being called the </v>

1266
01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:20.351
<v Speaker 6>demiurge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is essentially attempting to </v>

1267
01:01:20.351 --> 01:01:24.100
<v Speaker 6>create as sort of authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy in this particular dimension </v>

1268
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.931
<v Speaker 6>that's been separated from another place</v>
<v Speaker 6>known as the galactic.</v>

1269
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:31.730
<v Speaker 6>You can call it whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 6>want,</v>

1270
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:36.731
<v Speaker 6>but it's the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a galactic civilization that is </v>

1271
01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:40.601
<v Speaker 6>about to pour into this civilization and</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it really doesn't matter what you do </v>

1272
01:01:41.211 --> 01:01:46.211
<v Speaker 6>because within the next 20 or 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 6>through technology and through the </v>

1273
01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 6>unification of people because of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that technology,</v>

1274
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:52.520
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna either come to our site or </v>
<v Speaker 6>go completely insane.</v>

1275
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:58.450
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The counter to that of course is the </v>

1276
01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.611
<v Speaker 5>only way you're gonna get there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fucking lazy hippies because if we </v>

1277
01:02:00.611 --> 01:02:05.201
<v Speaker 5>make you go to work and we get shit done</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you buy things and you keep this </v>

1278
01:02:05.201 --> 01:02:07.280
<v Speaker 5>fucking country's economy healthy that </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1279
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 5>The technology innovators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that way we make the hyperspace gateway.</v>

1280
01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 5>You Lazy fucking hippies tripping balls </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your lawn furniture.</v>

1281
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 5>You're not creating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1282
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 5>You show up for work on time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get the job done.</v>

1283
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Eventually we'll get our portal.</v>

1284
01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.360
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it sounds okay.</v>

1285
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:25.120
<v Speaker 6>Can I address something you just said </v>
<v Speaker 6>Satan?</v>

1286
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.650
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>On time.</v>

1287
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.900
<v Speaker 6>Now this is a very funny term.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank God I'm reading David grave the.</v>

1288
01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Here's a great term on time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1289
01:02:32.771 --> 01:02:35.260
<v Speaker 6>So like boss,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>

1290
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 6>The problem is that like the thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing with time are being on </v>

1291
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.281
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a relatively new imposition into </v>

1292
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:46.000
<v Speaker 6>society and it started with clock </v>
<v Speaker 6>towers.</v>

1293
01:02:46.001 --> 01:02:49.600
<v Speaker 6>During the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd put clock towers up so the people</v>

1294
01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:54.601
<v Speaker 6>always knew what time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they wouldn't be late for going to </v>

1295
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:55.420
<v Speaker 6>work in a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In a factory.</v>

1296
01:02:55.421 --> 01:03:00.421
<v Speaker 6>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a time when people weren't </v>

1297
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 6>like obsessed with their fucking watch </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the idea that you could sell </v>

1298
01:03:04.421 --> 01:03:05.980
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's what it is,</v>

1299
01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:10.981
<v Speaker 6>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think you and I have entered into a </v>

1300
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:13.231
<v Speaker 6>contract where for some ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 6>reason I've agreed to sell you eight </v>

1301
01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:14.080
<v Speaker 6>hours of time.</v>

1302
01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 6>My time per day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially a form of slavery.</v>

1303
01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:24.331
<v Speaker 6>It's a kind of like slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>except I get to go free for a certain </v>

1304
01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:25.840
<v Speaker 6>amount of hours per week into servitude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1305
01:03:25.841 --> 01:03:29.050
<v Speaker 6>we can call it that with like less of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the power.</v>

1306
01:03:29.051 --> 01:03:31.150
<v Speaker 6>I can leave anytime I want indentured </v>
<v Speaker 6>servants.</v>

1307
01:03:31.151 --> 01:03:36.151
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they could because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were kind of trapped until they paid a </v>

1308
01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:37.260
<v Speaker 6>certain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Certain jobs are contract will,</v>

1309
01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:42.261
<v Speaker 6>you could quit most jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's kind of the </v>

1310
01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:42.261
<v Speaker 6>rationalization that people use is </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

1311
01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:44.710
<v Speaker 6>you can leave anytime you want bud in </v>
<v Speaker 6>anytime you want.</v>

1312
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>The hard jobs are those jobs where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people work for salary and their time is</v>

1313
01:03:50.151 --> 01:03:52.610
<v Speaker 1>just whatever the project takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

1314
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever talk to so many worse on </v>
<v Speaker 1>video games?</v>

1315
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Right now I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met very few people.</v>

1316
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a few,</v>

1317
01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:02.801
<v Speaker 1>but it's like they don't work in the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies do the hours that they put in </v>

1318
01:04:03.261 --> 01:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>before a video game is released is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

1319
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them just sleep in the offices </v>

1320
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>to work in 16 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just coding.</v>

1321
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.200
<v Speaker 1>They're all living on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A brutal,</v>

1322
01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:16.790
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>

1323
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.000
<v Speaker 6>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1324
01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:19.210
<v Speaker 6>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1325
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

1326
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>this is sounding job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking for someone's whole life.</v>

1327
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking for the whole life.</v>

1328
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You occasionally can get away from me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go camping.</v>

1329
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>You occasionally get away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a picnic with your family.</v>

1330
01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>You wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually you can get away,</v>

1331
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many months I want you all the time.</v>

1332
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I just want you there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in exchange I'll give you some </v>

1333
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

1334
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 6>conceptually I don't think that this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a terrible situation as long as the</v>

1335
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 6>person is really into what they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>

1336
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then what we have is just kind of </v>

1337
01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:53.540
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1338
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:58.670
<v Speaker 6>I guess you could say what a capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 6>commune or I don't know what you'd call </v>

1339
01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:03.061
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a group of people commuting </v>

1340
01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 6>together as seeking to like extract </v>
<v Speaker 6>money from the universe,</v>

1341
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:06.720
<v Speaker 6>but also like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what comes to mind?</v>

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 2>like the graphics which are incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the fight mechanics,</v>

1382
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.320
<v Speaker 2>which are also incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fucking story is really good and</v>

1383
01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:06.631
<v Speaker 2>the acting is really good and like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships between characters are </v>

1384
01:07:06.631 --> 01:07:11.161
<v Speaker 2>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This game will make you like tear up </v>

1385
01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like fucking,</v>

1386
01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:14.620
<v Speaker 2>we should see what he just did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chop that dude and half with an ax.</v>

1387
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this got smashed by a smashed.</v>

1388
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 2>He gets smashed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's created us.</v>

1389
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.050
<v Speaker 2>The God of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1390
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Does not give a fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

1391
01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't even show much more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's spoilers.</v>

1392
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:33.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody to see any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters or to know what's happening </v>

1393
01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 2>because it's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's such a good game.</v>

1394
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Most Games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I've played video games is I try</v>

1395
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>to rush through it for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really dumb to be like,</v>

1396
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to win this thing,</v>

1397
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>this one you want to hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look around,</v>

1398
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.580
<v Speaker 2>see the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you get really into it.</v>

1399
01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a glorious game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know that to get back to where </v>

1400
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blizzard,</v>

1401
01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1402
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 2>one of the people working there told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like building world of warcraft </v>

1403
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:08.050
<v Speaker 2>because we liked playing world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>warcraft.</v>

1404
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 2>We've created a dimension we want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of like we enjoy it,</v>

1405
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.230
<v Speaker 2>they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1406
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's why the game is so good </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's being made by people who </v>

1407
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.340
<v Speaker 2>enjoy playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how many hours they work</v>

1408
01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:23.510
<v Speaker 2>at blizzard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it's,</v>

1409
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 2>it can be pretty brutal schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in anything you do,</v>

1410
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>even things you love I know become </v>
<v Speaker 2>grueling,</v>

1411
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:35.351
<v Speaker 2>but I think that example of a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus a company where you're like </v>

1412
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:41.770
<v Speaker 2>either doing something that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even need to be there to do or no </v>

1413
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:42.980
<v Speaker 2>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no comparison.</v>

1414
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be massive hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you're having a great time a </v>

1415
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>lot of the time and the actual results </v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>

1416
01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:55.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was friends with a lot of those guys </v>

1417
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>from id software back in the quick two </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and played quake three.</v>

1418
01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I got to play quake three before it ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with you.</v>

1419
01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:02.140
<v Speaker 1>We are trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Dallas Clif.</v>

1420
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clif Eeb.</v>

1421
01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:09.261
<v Speaker 1>He's soft software as doom and quake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cliff Eby is unreal.</v>

1422
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with you and cliff.</v>

1423
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:14.480
<v Speaker 2>He began to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see the quake two as well.</v>

1424
01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Both amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we.</v>

1425
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:21.401

<v Speaker 1>we got to see unreal tournament when </v>

1426
01:09:21.401 --> 01:09:24.410
<v Speaker 1>they were putting that together and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were putting together this new engine </v>

1427
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>that will not being used in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different games afterwards,</v>

1428
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but it was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to see the graphics like as </v>

1429
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>they're designing things and same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the quakes studios,</v>

1430
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>but those guys all were crazy gamer so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get land parties and sync all</v>

1431
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>we played at the ID software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to play death matches between </v>

1432
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.381
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome to play quake with the </v>

1433
01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.480
<v Speaker 1>guys who made quake.</v>

1436
01:09:54.181 --> 01:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>played one of those games before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three dimensional games,</v>

1437
01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:01.590
<v Speaker 1>when you're running down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear things over here behind you and</v>

<v Speaker 1>corners and people are chasing around </v>

1440
01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:11.721
<v Speaker 1>the map and sometimes you could walk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any noise or you could </v>

1441
01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:12.720
<v Speaker 1>run and you can hear the footsteps.</v>

1493
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:40.660
<v Speaker 1>video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addictive tendency.</v>

1494
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 4>We're both like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1495
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 4>gotTa be careful.</v>

1496
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.810
<v Speaker 6>But Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know this.</v>

1497
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.590
<v Speaker 6>This is something I was thinking I </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted to bring up during the podcast.</v>

1498
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:54.591
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when we first started hanging </v>

1499
01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:56.361
<v Speaker 6>out and you told me something I've never</v>
<v Speaker 6>gotten in.</v>

1500
01:12:56.581 --> 01:13:01.581
<v Speaker 6>It's from the book of five rings by Mia </v>
<v Speaker 6>Motto Musashi and you mentioned </v>

1501
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:11.511
<v Speaker 6>something from that book which is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>learn one thing and you will know how to</v>

1502
01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 6>do a lot of other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1503
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 6>So he would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1504
01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.210
<v Speaker 6>apparently he would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1505
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 6>he was a Samurai and so he recommended </v>
<v Speaker 6>for Samurai not just to learn the sword,</v>

1506
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 6>but to learn poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>learn how to paint,</v>

1507
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.820
<v Speaker 6>learn how to do this step.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because in the metta process of </v>

1508
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:34.820
<v Speaker 6>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you learn,</v>

1509
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.710
<v Speaker 6>you like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's something in there that like </v>

1510
01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:39.990
<v Speaker 6>fits onto all forms of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1511
01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be too hard,</v>

1512
01:13:41.381 --> 01:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to be too soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a balance right in,</v>

1513
01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:46.720
<v Speaker 1>in a balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must.</v>

1514
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:50.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to be artistic and destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be loving and hating.</v>

1515
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1516
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>he played games with his opponents like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just fight.</v>

1517
01:13:55.511 --> 01:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy,</v>

1518
01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 1>he was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would show up hours late for duals </v>

1519
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and make the guy wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1520
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>say knew the guy would be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would show up sometimes with wooden </v>

1521
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>swords instead of metal swords to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their heads.</v>

1522
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.550
<v Speaker 1>One time he whittled a sword out of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>or of the boat that he,</v>

1523
01:14:11.551 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>he rode over to the beach where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have the sword fight.</v>

1524
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Showed up hours late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>

1525
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Up with an or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1526
01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:21.300
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would play games with people.</v>

1527
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there was psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare in him showing up late.</v>

1528
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1529
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.960
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.650
<v Speaker 6>And do you remember the first sentence </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the book?</v>

1531
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the quote that you just were </v>

1532
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>talking about because I say it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1533
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like the reason why I have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoo on my arm.</v>

1534
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>This is Musashi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1535
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you understand the way broadly or </v>

1536
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>once you know the way broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see it in all things that.</v>

1537
01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.060
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so which is also a as above.</v>

1539
01:14:48.061 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 6>So below it's another way of saying that</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

1540
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:53.130
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's the concept that uh,</v>

1541
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:55.800
<v Speaker 6>if I practice some things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1542
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.600
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like right now,</v>

1543
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.400
<v Speaker 6>like I'm learning how to do modular </v>
<v Speaker 6>synthesis.</v>

1544
01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 6>Like at modular sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're bad ass.</v>

1545
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.300
<v Speaker 6>It's like for making music,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1546
01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm 44.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not like thinking to myself like,</v>

1547
01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.020
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one day I'm going to be fucking based </v>

1548
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:15.020
<v Speaker 6>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to get,</v>

1549
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:15.020
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1550
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:15.230
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't leave.</v>

1551
01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:19.590
<v Speaker 6>I'll perform live with them ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm,</v>

1552
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.280
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got sucked into it and now I'm taking </v>

1553
01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.190
<v Speaker 6>it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm learning how to do it for real.</v>

1554
01:15:26.191 --> 01:15:31.191
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then that pulls you into like music </v>

1555
01:15:31.191 --> 01:15:31.191
<v Speaker 6>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1556
01:15:31.191 --> 01:15:32.160
<v Speaker 6>So now you start looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well what is this song and why does this</v>

1557
01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:37.161
<v Speaker 6>song is a song set up like it is and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what her notes and what's a tone,</v>

1558
01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.270
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1559
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:41.250
<v Speaker 6>What's an Oscillator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are these things?</v>

1560
01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:46.251
<v Speaker 6>And then like from that you get pulled </v>
<v Speaker 6>into like pythagoras and then suddenly </v>

1561
01:15:46.321 --> 01:15:51.321
<v Speaker 6>you're like reading like shit by </v>
<v Speaker 6>Pythagoras who like had another great </v>

1562
01:15:51.321 --> 01:15:56.211
<v Speaker 6>quote which is do not take the roads </v>
<v Speaker 6>traveled by the public is pretty </v>

1563
01:15:56.211 --> 01:15:57.930
<v Speaker 6>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means isn't that bad ass?</v>

1564
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.850
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but anyway,</v>

1565
01:15:59.851 --> 01:16:04.851
<v Speaker 6>the point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I've been studying like the </v>

1566
01:16:04.851 --> 01:16:07.560
<v Speaker 6>modular synthesizer now when I sit down </v>
<v Speaker 6>and play guitar,</v>

1567
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.980
<v Speaker 6>like I'm a little better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then where it gets fucking weird is </v>

1568
01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.060
<v Speaker 6>when I sit down and play like God a war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a little better at that too.</v>

1569
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:22.070
<v Speaker 6>And then like when I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>cutting tomatoes,</v>

1570
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something really basic and the pressure </v>

1571
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm exerting to cut the tomato versus </v>
<v Speaker 6>the sharpness of the knife.</v>

1572
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.850
<v Speaker 6>I think about music and I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

1573
01:16:31.851 --> 01:16:34.850
<v Speaker 6>in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my knife is like a,</v>

1574
01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:36.680
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you won't know what this is.</v>

1575
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 6>Maybe like my knife is like a CV gate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like if you have a tone,</v>

1576
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:47.010
<v Speaker 6>like a gate might be an on and off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a switch that makes the tango will,</v>

1577
01:16:47.881 --> 01:16:48.170
<v Speaker 6>will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will,</v>

1578
01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:53.171
<v Speaker 6>will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will blah blah blah blah blah blah blah </v>

1579
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:53.171
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1580
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:53.171
<v Speaker 6>So suddenly the shit you're learning </v>
<v Speaker 6>from like.</v>

1581
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:54.230
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>synth nerds out there.</v>

1582
01:16:54.231 --> 01:16:56.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what I just fucking said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucked it up.</v>

1583
01:16:56.151 --> 01:16:58.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry I'm learning but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1584
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:59.270
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1585
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.990
<v Speaker 6>what I'm saying is it's like what he was</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>

1586
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:05.880
<v Speaker 6>what he was teaching is so powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like what?</v>

1587
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:10.890
<v Speaker 6>You don't just get good at one thing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>into other shit and your wife to sure.</v>

1588
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.760
<v Speaker 6>That is an incredible thing for me to </v>
<v Speaker 6>realize man.</v>

1589
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 6>It's been pretty intense because like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1590
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:23.480
<v Speaker 6>when you like what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1591
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:25.580
<v Speaker 6>for if you're a 20 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1592
01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 6>people expect you to be learning </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1593
01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 6>this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you're in your forties,</v>

1594
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can trick yourself into thinking </v>

1595
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:35.800
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't need to learn how to do anything</v>

1596
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.271
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you're basically like turning </v>

1597
01:17:40.271 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 6>down all the lights in your life because</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you start working on something,</v>

1598
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:45.300
<v Speaker 5>even this is what I was going to ask </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1599
01:17:45.301 --> 01:17:47.050
<v Speaker 5>and maybe even video games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1600
01:17:47.051 --> 01:17:48.070
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Video Games,</v>

1601
01:17:48.071 --> 01:17:52.510
<v Speaker 5>do we dismiss them because they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought of as frivolous exercises and we</v>

1602
01:17:52.511 --> 01:17:56.830
<v Speaker 5>embrace chess and go and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even poker because we know that it's</v>

1603
01:17:56.831 --> 01:18:01.831
<v Speaker 5>an intellectual pursuit or real poker </v>
<v Speaker 5>players are all super fucking smart </v>

1604
01:18:01.831 --> 01:18:01.831
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guys that were really good at it.</v>

1605
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that we do that with video games</v>

1606
01:18:04.511 --> 01:18:09.511
<v Speaker 5>because at one point in time they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>just pong and then they were mario </v>

1607
01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:10.330
<v Speaker 5>brothers and they were silliness and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun.</v>

1608
01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:14.290
<v Speaker 5>You get the mushroom and have a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and PAC man and all that shed.</v>

1609
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:16.840
<v Speaker 5>But now when you see God at war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1610
01:18:16.841 --> 01:18:20.290
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well clearly your brain is firing on all</v>

1611
01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:21.610
<v Speaker 5>cylinders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're doing that.</v>

1612
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:25.540
<v Speaker 5>You're swinging that acts and switch </v>
<v Speaker 5>into this sphere and doing this.</v>

1613
01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:30.541
<v Speaker 5>And jumping there and chopping this </v>
<v Speaker 5>student half and getting away from the </v>

1614
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:31.510
<v Speaker 5>guy with the fucking flying logs thrown </v>
<v Speaker 5>at you.</v>

1615
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.810
<v Speaker 5>That's your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your brain's firing left and right.</v>

1616
01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:37.990
<v Speaker 5>The idea that this is totally useless </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems stupid.</v>

1617
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:18:39.271 --> 01:18:43.320
<v Speaker 6>So I think that that potentially through</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything,</v>

1619
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:48.210
<v Speaker 6>the problem with video games is you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>play them and actually not get better at</v>

1620
01:18:48.211 --> 01:18:51.300
<v Speaker 6>them because you just like are slashing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and pressing buttons and Shit.</v>

1621
01:18:51.301 --> 01:18:55.650
<v Speaker 6>Like you have to folk you can focus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think when focus,</v>

1622
01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.030
<v Speaker 6>when your attention and focus gets put </v>
<v Speaker 6>on improving anything,</v>

1623
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:05.040
<v Speaker 6>like I theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I imagine if you just started working on</v>

1624
01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:10.041
<v Speaker 6>drawing a circle or drawing a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 6>circle and just spent day after day </v>

1625
01:19:11.211 --> 01:19:14.990
<v Speaker 6>working on that pursuit sounds insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you'd look crazy,</v>

1626
01:19:14.991 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 6>dear friends for potentially other shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>in your life.</v>

1627
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 6>You'd start improving at to your mind </v>
<v Speaker 6>gets a little sharper maybe.</v>

1628
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:25.200
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's just some kind of neuro</v>

1629
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.640
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

1630
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.230
<v Speaker 5>it's exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an exercise for your mind for sure.</v>

1631
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very active when you're playing a video </v>

1632
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.270
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1633
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.270
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what I would play,</v>

1634
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.701
<v Speaker 5>quake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my hands would get so sweaty that I </v>

1635
01:19:38.701 --> 01:19:40.570
<v Speaker 5>would put antiperspirant on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would spray antiperspirant all over my</v>

1636
01:19:40.571 --> 01:19:45.571
<v Speaker 5>hands and then I would blow on them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep them from getting so sweaty because</v>

1637
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:51.630
<v Speaker 5>my fingers would barely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would slip around over the </v>

1638
01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:51.910
<v Speaker 5>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I leave puddles and keys.</v>

1639
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.120
<v Speaker 5>My mouse would get soaking wet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My it wouldn't be dripping over the </v>

1640
01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.530
<v Speaker 5>mouse pad and the ball would get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then eventually became a laser beam,</v>

1641
01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:04.710
<v Speaker 5>laser tracking first suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it got way better for us was like </v>

1642
01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.230
<v Speaker 5>you wanted that ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to feel that the ball,</v>

1643
01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 5>the mouse because you got that tactile </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensation,</v>

1644
01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 5>but then it got to a point where these </v>
<v Speaker 5>laser ones were so much more accurate </v>

1645
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:14.690
<v Speaker 5>and they never fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just became better.</v>

1646
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:17.280
<v Speaker 5>That shit has always been like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>odd to me.</v>

1647
01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:22.281
<v Speaker 5>When you look at a gaming mouse and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>says how precise it is under the DPIS </v>

1648
01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:27.050
<v Speaker 5>DPI.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember razer mouse had one that was </v>

1649
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:29.590
<v Speaker 5>2000 DPI,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Mamba and it was crazy.</v>

1650
01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 5>You play with the thing and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>

1651
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:36.950
<v Speaker 5>it was so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was an odd shape like it was a duck </v>

1652
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.950
<v Speaker 5>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that?</v>

1653
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay away to the ones.</v>

1654
01:20:37.851 --> 01:20:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Now you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a button on it.</v>

1655
01:20:38.961 --> 01:20:41.900
<v Speaker 3>You can switch mid game depending on </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing or what you need.</v>

1656
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:44.390
<v Speaker 3>You can set up your DPI from uptake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W 8,000,</v>

1657
01:20:44.391 --> 01:20:46.630
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 down to 200.</v>

1658
01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:49.340
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder why we made it slower.</v>

1659
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Slower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some games like you,</v>

1660
01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:54.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to be moving that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might be a sniper,</v>

1661
01:20:54.911 --> 01:20:59.911
<v Speaker 3>so you need very small adjustments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make big moves with your hands </v>

1662
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:00.650
<v Speaker 3>and have still a small adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:21:00.651 --> 01:21:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the adrenaline would kick in,</v>

1664
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:06.460
<v Speaker 3>they would like a slow mouse speed and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big mouse pad and they moved</v>

1665
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:11.590
<v Speaker 5>pat around like that and they felt more </v>
<v Speaker 5>precise that way than they were with a </v>

1666
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:15.290
<v Speaker 5>small pat and a high speed because some </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys used to like do little wrist flicks</v>

1667
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:17.720
<v Speaker 5>were like super high speed and you would</v>
<v Speaker 5>try their mouse.</v>

1668
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 5>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

1669
01:21:18.471 --> 01:21:23.471
<v Speaker 5>can I try your setback?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because everybody set was different and </v>

1670
01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:23.471
<v Speaker 5>I would try their setup of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

1671
01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:24.300
<v Speaker 5>how do you even concentrate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

1672
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:29.301
<v Speaker 5>It's you're moving so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would have their speeches and they </v>

1673
01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:30.560
<v Speaker 5>would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our acceleration mouse accelerations.</v>

1674
01:21:30.561 --> 01:21:32.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you move faster,</v>

1675
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:35.120
<v Speaker 5>it actually goes faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost like you're throwing a whip.</v>

1676
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1677
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I know dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need that in starcraft.</v>

1678
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you're doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh absolutely.</v>

1679
01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very important.</v>

1680
01:21:42.281 --> 01:21:47.281
<v Speaker 2>Getting your mouse set at the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed and then you get used to that </v>

1681
01:21:47.281 --> 01:21:47.320
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your mouse is fucked up,</v>

1682
01:21:47.321 --> 01:21:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely gonna like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna make bad decisions.</v>

1683
01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:53.740
<v Speaker 2>But I never got like I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1684
01:21:53.741 --> 01:21:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It star craft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got up to like,</v>

1685
01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:02.370
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe silver league or something like </v>

1686
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:02.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1687
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So if you were interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a big deal.</v>

1688
01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Would you have a purple belt belt after </v>
<v Speaker 2>white belt?</v>

1689
01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the one after that?</v>

1690
01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Purple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably blue blue belt because </v>

1691
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>bronze league is where I stayed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1692
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the white belt stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1693
01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:19.030
<v Speaker 2>mercilessly getting my fucking ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>handed to me in bronze league.</v>

1694
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 2>And then like finally I figured it out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and for I popped into the </v>

1695
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.901
<v Speaker 2>silver league and then you want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the fucking bronze league </v>

1696
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 2>because once you get to the silver lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do a fucking early game </v>

1697
01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:34.090
<v Speaker 2>painting rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't like,</v>

1698
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck no,</v>

1699
01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you can't do any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you try it,</v>

1700
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 2>when you try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna like they're gonna make </v>

1701
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:45.691
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know they're going to tie it to you </v>

1702
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:45.691
<v Speaker 2>like no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're also going to be like,</v>

1703
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:45.691
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1704
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking newb fuck you.</v>

1705
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

1706
01:22:49.421 --> 01:22:54.421
<v Speaker 2>I wanted a real game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do something like early </v>

1707
01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:54.640
<v Speaker 2>game failing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rushed against my.</v>

1708
01:22:55.250 --> 01:23:00.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't want people to get super mad </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're fucking connection with </v>

1709
01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:03.161
<v Speaker 3>timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would be stuck in the game and </v>

1710
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:03.161
<v Speaker 3>you'd fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuck.</v>

1711
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Frozen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know like</v>

1713
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you do you use like your </v>
<v Speaker 5>smallest gun and just slowly pick away </v>

1714

<v Speaker 5>When we were in the old quake games,</v>

1717
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:15.700
<v Speaker 5>you could punch dudes.</v>

1718

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1719
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.610
<v Speaker 6>There was some video that popped up at </v>
<v Speaker 6>that new game fortnight.</v>

1720
01:23:20.611 --> 01:23:22.880
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's playing and it's like it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>on Undergrad.</v>

1721
01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.920
<v Speaker 6>I was like the worst fortnight player </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever because it's someone who clearly </v>

1722
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 6>got up to go get chips or maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1723
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:33.750
<v Speaker 6>and the dude's like shooting at them and</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't hit like a still person.</v>

1724
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man games are bad ass these days.</v>

1725
01:23:37.051 --> 01:23:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really love him,</v>

1726
01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:43.281
<v Speaker 6>but I do like think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still am probably just because I'm </v>

1727
01:23:44.551 --> 01:23:49.551
<v Speaker 6>like an older person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do think there's like a hierarchy of </v>

1728
01:23:49.551 --> 01:23:53.040
<v Speaker 6>like what's good to do and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad for me.</v>

1729
01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:55.140
<v Speaker 6>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like learning music right now.</v>

1730
01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:59.760
<v Speaker 6>I like sitting down picking some basic </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing about music,</v>

1731
01:23:59.761 --> 01:24:01.880
<v Speaker 6>figuring out one little thing about a </v>
<v Speaker 6>module,</v>

1732
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.920
<v Speaker 6>one of my sense and what it does and </v>
<v Speaker 6>understanding it and then like unfolding</v>

1733
01:24:08.071 --> 01:24:11.640
<v Speaker 6>that into something bigger and that can </v>
<v Speaker 6>lead to hours of,</v>

1734
01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.700
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas like if I sit down and play God </v>

1735
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.981
<v Speaker 6>of war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that's also going to lead to </v>

1736
01:24:18.981 --> 01:24:22.251
<v Speaker 6>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But at the end of it I'm going to know </v>

1737
01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:24.081
<v Speaker 6>more about a story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas the other one I'm going to know </v>

1738
01:24:24.081 --> 01:24:27.261
<v Speaker 6>a little bit more about math and like </v>
<v Speaker 6>how sound works in general,</v>

1739
01:24:28.051 --> 01:24:30.770
<v Speaker 6>which is a fascinating thing altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1740
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.980
<v Speaker 6>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>

1741
01:24:31.981 --> 01:24:34.080
<v Speaker 6>Is there a hierarchy of shit to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like</v>

1742
01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.300
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there is.</v>

1743
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:39.710
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a hierarchy and elevated</v>
<v Speaker 5>passion levels.</v>

1744
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:45.190
<v Speaker 5>So like what are you passionate about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say if you were doing something and you </v>

1745
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.360
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were very apathetic about it,</v>

1746
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:49.880
<v Speaker 5>but then there was this other thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you did that once you started,</v>

1747
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:52.700
<v Speaker 5>like for some people of the World Cup </v>
<v Speaker 5>was on today,</v>

1748
01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:55.910
<v Speaker 5>I went to get a cup of coffee and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the World Cup on and these guys are</v>

1749
01:24:55.911 --> 01:24:58.970
<v Speaker 5>gathering around watching the World Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me it's just dudes running around.</v>

1750
01:24:58.971 --> 01:25:00.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1751
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.820
<v Speaker 5>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great,</v>

1752
01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:04.400
<v Speaker 5>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for them it was clearly.</v>

1753
01:25:04.401 --> 01:25:09.401
<v Speaker 5>And for the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all the people watching in the </v>

1754
01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:09.401
<v Speaker 5>stands is an elevated level of passion </v>
<v Speaker 5>for that.</v>

1755
01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that was your thing,</v>

1756
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:14.651
<v Speaker 5>I would say maybe you can be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>commentator and maybe you can be a </v>

1757
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.291
<v Speaker 5>player or maybe it could be someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>produces one of those soccer shows or </v>

1758
01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:17.291
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1759
01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:20.870
<v Speaker 5>There's just plenty of gigs for that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if that's your thing and instead you</v>

1760
01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:23.780
<v Speaker 5>get into shoe sales,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Al Bundy,</v>

1761
01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after awhile that shit chips away.</v>

1762
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Just not what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I like is I want to play soccer,</v>

1763
01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:32.870
<v Speaker 5>I want to watch soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to talk about soccer,</v>

1764
01:25:32.871 --> 01:25:34.940
<v Speaker 5>I want to commentate on soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.800
<v Speaker 5>you got to find the thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>yellow gold,</v>

1766
01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.940
<v Speaker 5>not everybody can commentate on soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dad is true,</v>

1767
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a loser mentality like </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone can.</v>

1768
01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how many people try?</v>

1769
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.430
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people say,</v>

1770
01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:51.110
<v Speaker 5>not everybody can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comedian.</v>

1771
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:53.570
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people try though,</v>

1772
01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:56.120
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that many people try.</v>

1773
01:25:56.810 --> 01:26:00.110
<v Speaker 5>A more people could do it then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then try.</v>

1774
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.140
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a bunch of people out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there that could.</v>

1775
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 5>I always tell you about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've told you about this guy,</v>

1776
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.950
<v Speaker 1>my friend Dave Dolan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is my boss,</v>

1777
01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a private investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

1778
01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I got a gig driving him around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed an assistant.</v>

1779
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a Dui and they took his license </v>

1780
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:19.070
<v Speaker 1>away and needed a driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the funniest guy I've ever met.</v>

1781
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He's right up there with Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so funny,</v>

1782
01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:23.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1783
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:28.270
<v Speaker 1>not no aspirations for comedy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his cousin was Billy Downs who was </v>

1784
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:31.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the owners of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection in Boston.</v>

1785
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.880
<v Speaker 1>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cousin was a former comedian who </v>

1786
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.841
<v Speaker 1>owned the comedy club and just randomly </v>
<v Speaker 1>became friends with them from an ad on </v>

1787
01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:45.830
<v Speaker 1>like one of those newspaper ads for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job seeking private investigators </v>

1788
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:46.260
<v Speaker 1>assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1789
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a cool job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1790
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.020
<v Speaker 1>But this guy easily could have been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>

1791
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could have been.</v>

1792
01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>

1793
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:59.380
<v Speaker 1>He was a funny fucking dude and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always the guy that has a bunch of </v>

1794
01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.140
<v Speaker 1>people were saying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say something like,</v>

1795
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:05.200
<v Speaker 1>totally ridiculous looking in the eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say it and everybody would be </v>

1796
01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:05.200
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just natural.</v>

1797
01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 1>He was just a naturally funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just didn't do it.</v>

1798
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Did he liked being a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigator?</v>

1799
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>

1800
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Loved busting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheaters.</v>

1801
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Mostly people who were cheating on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance.</v>

1802
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:19.670
<v Speaker 1>That was mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1803
01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.740
<v Speaker 1>There was a few one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got one guy who kept asking him to </v>

1804
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.480
<v Speaker 1>take pictures of his girlfriend getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked by this giant bodybuilder.</v>

1805
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Dude after wise like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>pictures through attitude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>more pictures.</v>

1811
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.560
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

1812
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:51.430
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't the guy just hire a </v>

1813
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.430
<v Speaker 1>photographer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1814
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Well the guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just like really wealthy but </v>

1815
01:27:54.581 --> 01:27:57.080
<v Speaker 1>diminutive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very non masculine man.</v>

1816
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And he had this bombshell girl that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had figured out a way to get a part of.</v>

1817
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was just getting drilled on the </v>

1818
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.731
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did she know he was getting pictures </v>

1819
01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:09.731
<v Speaker 1>taken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she did.</v>

1820
01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's.</v>

1821
01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it sounds like a fetish game where</v>

1822
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1823
01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 1>seems like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it was.</v>

1824
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:21.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just a weak guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what to do because they </v>

1825
01:28:21.071 --> 01:28:23.601
<v Speaker 1>would be on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He get pictures of him on the beach </v>

1826
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 1>making out and stuff like he got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got enough pictures.</v>

1827
01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.670
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't.</v>

1828
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1829
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me sounds a little bit like,</v>

1830
01:28:28.641 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 1>well that's what he thought a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1831
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.280
<v Speaker 1>He thought the guy was a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak,</v>

1832
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.750
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1833
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1834
01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:35.570

<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pictures did make a move.</v>

1836
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:40.060

<v Speaker 1>Not taking any more.</v>

1837
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Clf Sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a shit job.</v>

1838
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved busting people.</v>

1839
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really like.</v>

1840
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 1>That was rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time he worked for insurance</v>

1841
01:28:50.301 --> 01:28:55.301
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's like say if you </v>

1842
01:28:55.301 --> 01:28:56.720
<v Speaker 1>were married and you were a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a different maiden name,</v>

1843
01:28:56.750 --> 01:29:01.750
<v Speaker 1>you would get injured on the job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would start using your maiden </v>

1844
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 1>name and take a job on the side while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting workman's compensation.</v>

1845
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:06.190
<v Speaker 1>So people would get double paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1846
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:11.210
<v Speaker 1>and they would have to leave their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people would leave their job super </v>

1847
01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>early in the morning so we would camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in front of people's houses where we</v>

1848
01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>would get there at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning when everybody's asleep.</v>

1849
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 1>We'd sit in the car across the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd wait sometimes earlier and we'd</v>

1850
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:23.691
<v Speaker 1>wait and we'd wait and we wait 5:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll around and then you'd see some </v>

1851
01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:24.120
<v Speaker 1>light go on and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's up,</v>

1852
01:29:24.121 --> 01:29:24.990
<v Speaker 1>he's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's up here.</v>

1853
01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here he goes,</v>

1854
01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's going to work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy that's supposed to be </v>

1855
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.621
<v Speaker 1>laid up in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we catch them like working as a </v>

1856
01:29:33.621 --> 01:29:36.111
<v Speaker 1>roofer carrying shingles up the ladder </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're getting disable a </v>

1857
01:29:36.111 --> 01:29:37.070
<v Speaker 1>disability insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 1>So that was a really common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it was disability insurance</v>

1859
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What a fucked up state of life to get </v>

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.790
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that man.</v>

1867
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.440

<v Speaker 1>say that like they're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that like they're just dating.</v>

1870
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think it was that big a </v>

1871
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think through it very well.</v>

1872
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:17.140
<v Speaker 1>There was one lady was so nice.</v>

1917
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.600

<v Speaker 2>synonymous with not being dangerous or a</v>

1918
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:10.150
<v Speaker 2>crook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really funny thing.</v>

1919
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:15.540

<v Speaker 2>that's like a really great costume to </v>

1920
01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:19.471
<v Speaker 2>put on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to camouflage yourself </v>

1924
01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>was a big deal to rip off a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People grow up thinking corporations are</v>

1925
01:32:28.031 --> 01:32:33.031
<v Speaker 1>faceless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nameless entities and you can extract </v>

01:32:33.031 --> 01:32:36.301
<v Speaker 1>money from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way people think of </v>

1927
01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:38.671
<v Speaker 1>some liability lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you slip on some water in the </v>

01:33:18.541 --> 01:33:18.850
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little better,</v>

1946
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:21.640
<v Speaker 2>a little weak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit off balance course,</v>

1947
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.730
<v Speaker 2>but reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is she didn't feel good </v>

1948
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 2>about that probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a great way to live,</v>

1949
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1950
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and so by getting corrected by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe in those ways,</v>

1951
01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good thing.</v>

1952
01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1953
01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 2>some things aren't illegal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

1954
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like obviously like we agree on some of </v>

1955
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1956
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up to bus people for if </v>

1957
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 2>you're stealing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1958
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1959
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.100
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

1960
01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:53.620
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

1961
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1962
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:55.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1963
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:58.140
<v Speaker 1>But I would have never turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have said this.</v>

1964
01:33:58.250 --> 01:34:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have never been a good </v>

1965
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:03.250
<v Speaker 1>private investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1966
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a lot of those people and I </v>

1967
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.941
<v Speaker 1>was at the time 21 at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the most 21.</v>

1968
01:34:10.851 --> 01:34:15.851
<v Speaker 1>I think at that time I was really well </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of like the,</v>

1969
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:20.960
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood where my grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up,</v>

1970
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:22.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1971
01:34:22.071 --> 01:34:27.071
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being around them and being around </v>

1972
01:34:27.071 --> 01:34:29.360
<v Speaker 1>my parents who grew up in the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then my grandparents who grew up,</v>

1973
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hearing the depression and </v>

1974
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:36.941
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a different attitude about </v>

1975
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:36.941
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody was poor.</v>

1976
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody would like take advantage </v>

1977
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 1>of every opportunity and if you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to run a scam,</v>

1978
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's this terrible thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in,</v>

1980
01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.400
<v Speaker 1>in poor communities is that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of like insurance scams,</v>

1981
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:52.800
<v Speaker 1>this kind of scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1982
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think about it like a score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1983
01:34:55.341 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>think about it like it's a score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard say that to me</v>

1984
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an older Italian guys.</v>

1985
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:01.250
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to think about this.</v>

1986
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 5>This is a score.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

1987
01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:04.700
<v Speaker 5>Can't fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got an opportunity here.</v>

1988
01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 5>All you have to do is you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking chiropractor.</v>

1989
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:09.740
<v Speaker 5>My back hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't tell you why your back hurts.</v>

1990
01:35:09.741 --> 01:35:12.410
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows why you fucking back hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is true.</v>

1991
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:15.050
<v Speaker 5>You would go to a chiropractor every day</v>
<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>

1992
01:35:15.051 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 5>my back is fucking killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a shooting pain down my leg.</v>

1993
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 5>They can't prove it or disprove it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next thing you know,</v>

1994
01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:22.100
<v Speaker 5>you get a $35,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>check in the mail.</v>

1995
01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.010
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1996
01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:23.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1997
01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:24.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1998
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.690
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Number one,</v>

1999
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:30.750
<v Speaker 6>I felt like I have to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would not have turned this fucking </v>

2000
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.990
<v Speaker 6>that woman in if I was not a private </v>
<v Speaker 6>investigator,</v>

2001
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:36.470
<v Speaker 6>but that'd be in Dolan ethically had to </v>
<v Speaker 6>turn her in because if he didn't he </v>

2002
01:35:36.551 --> 01:35:41.551
<v Speaker 6>would be guilty of stealing from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>person who was giving him money to do </v>

2003
01:35:41.551 --> 01:35:41.620
<v Speaker 6>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was never a question.</v>

2004
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what he did for a living.</v>

2005
01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:44.920
<v Speaker 6>He was turned around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

2006
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:49.930
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the main like problem with stealing a </v>

2007
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:51.290
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2008
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:56.320
<v Speaker 6>sometimes I've been hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 6>people you leave a grocery store and </v>

2009
01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 6>somehow they didn't charge for like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

2010
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 6>a bottle of water or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they didn't see it in the car.</v>

2011
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the people,</v>

2012
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:06.130
<v Speaker 6>some people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it.</v>

2013
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.340
<v Speaker 6>Free water.</v>

2014
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:08.810
<v Speaker 6>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2015
01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:14.140
<v Speaker 6>And like man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think those people are unaware of this</v>

2016
01:36:14.631 --> 01:36:19.631
<v Speaker 6>like weird law in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is that you seem to like have to </v>

2017
01:36:19.631 --> 01:36:24.000
<v Speaker 6>get shipped back times three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it feels like maybe a little bit more </v>

2018
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.421
<v Speaker 6>than that when you give or take or to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like if you steal a $2 bottle of </v>

2019
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 6>water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now this is my superstition,</v>

2020
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:36.040
<v Speaker 6>you're going to end up paying like at </v>
<v Speaker 6>least six bucks for that bottle of water</v>

2021
01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 6>in some other way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some Karmic,</v>

2022
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:41.180
<v Speaker 6>some shit's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get a parking ticket,</v>

2023
01:36:41.181 --> 01:36:42.890
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get some weird fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2024
01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 6>So I think a thief is unaware of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>metaphysical economy,</v>

2025
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.840
<v Speaker 6>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think you're going to get away with </v>

2026
01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:52.840
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're not like,</v>

2027
01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.490
<v Speaker 6>if you could really get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would give me pause.</v>

2028
01:36:55.670 --> 01:37:00.670
<v Speaker 6>But like I've noticed man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all my friends who are really </v>

2029
01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:04.691
<v Speaker 6>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they leave giant fucking tips,</v>

2030
01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:07.990
<v Speaker 6>crazy tips,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy tips,</v>

2031
01:37:07.991 --> 01:37:09.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a few of these people,</v>

2032
01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:14.221
<v Speaker 6>Joe tips were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes the waitress cry.</v>

2033
01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.880
<v Speaker 6>And also I've noticed they will dodge </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of a place before they can be </v>

2034
01:37:21.161 --> 01:37:24.880
<v Speaker 6>acknowledged for leaving some insanely </v>
<v Speaker 6>massive tip to.</v>

2035
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 6>I'm right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to talk about milk.</v>

2036
01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:27.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm not here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't want to fuck it.</v>

2037
01:37:27.911 --> 01:37:29.230
<v Speaker 6>Embarrass you man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's like,</v>

2038
01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of don't.</v>

2039
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.300
<v Speaker 6>But the main thing is like that's a love</v>
<v Speaker 6>bomb.</v>

2040
01:37:34.301 --> 01:37:35.730
<v Speaker 6>That's why I was called up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2041
01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.810
<v Speaker 6>leave a love bomb for the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2042
01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:43.260
<v Speaker 6>But I think also there's another side to</v>
<v Speaker 6>it that is more than just like the </v>

2043
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:47.320
<v Speaker 6>feeling you get of knowing you've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>generous and you're not that attached to</v>

2044
01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:48.070
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2045
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.080
<v Speaker 5>it's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get an opportunity to give a </v>

2046
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 5>nudge in a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They feel good so that they feel good.</v>

2047
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:01.190
<v Speaker 5>It looks so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives you a hundred dollar tip for a </v>

2048
01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 5>fucking cup of coffee or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get this feeling like,</v>

2049
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden a beautiful feeling of a</v>

2050
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 5>normal situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a normal interaction.</v>

2051
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I give you this and you can give me </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2052
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:10.260
<v Speaker 5>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

2053
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2054
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 5>in that normal interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden,</v>

2055
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.840
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get this beautiful gift from a </v>

2056
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:17.840
<v Speaker 5>stranger that didn't know how to do have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do that for no reason at all.</v>

2057
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 5>Just a little love bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:24.531
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's even better when you're not there </v>

2059
01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:24.531
<v Speaker 5>when you're in the car driving and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize you left before him.</v>

2060
01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see that thing right there,</v>

2061
01:38:25.731 --> 01:38:30.731
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that if you go back to what we were </v>

2062
01:38:30.731 --> 01:38:30.731
<v Speaker 6>talking about about momentum.</v>

2063
01:38:30.731 --> 01:38:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Puts a little ripples out there.</v>

2064
01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Those ripples spread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2065
01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:36.390
<v Speaker 5>and it's not just with that obviously do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it with money.</v>

2066
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's being nice to people.</v>

2067
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:43.490
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had days where like I'm just </v>

2068
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:44.700
<v Speaker 5>walking somewhere and someone looks at </v>
<v Speaker 5>me and they go,</v>

2069
01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:45.230
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hi.</v>

2070
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 5>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything good?</v>

2071
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2072
01:38:47.101 --> 01:38:48.150
<v Speaker 5>everything's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How you doing?</v>

2073
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing good.</v>

2074
01:38:49.381 --> 01:38:54.381
<v Speaker 5>Enjoy the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just so nice little friendly </v>

2075
01:38:54.381 --> 01:38:55.140
<v Speaker 5>interaction with some person who never </v>
<v Speaker 5>met before and for no reason.</v>

2076
01:38:55.141 --> 01:38:58.230
<v Speaker 5>Just wants to be a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those make you feel good,</v>

2077
01:38:58.231 --> 01:38:59.050
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are.</v>

2078
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Those are nice moments and contract.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conversely,</v>

2079
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:07.610
<v Speaker 5>weird moments that I've had where people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are distracted and they're looking </v>

2080
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.610
<v Speaker 5>at their phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not paying attention.</v>

2081
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:12.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking dummy that almost ran into </v>

2082
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:12.181
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to think that,</v>

2083
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:13.380
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a dumb way to think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do think it,</v>

2084
01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:15.220
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's like a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2085
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 5>some fucking kid just trying to push it.</v>

2086
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.530
<v Speaker 5>Where's the opposing army?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they almost run into you like,</v>

2087
01:39:19.531 --> 01:39:21.390
<v Speaker 5>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your phone.</v>

2088
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2089
01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 5>They are radiating this momentum into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

2090
01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:27.570
<v Speaker 5>They're not interacting with people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are there.</v>

2091
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Versus a person who's like genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice is I just see someone walking down </v>

2092
01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 5>the street and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good morning,</v>

2093
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.010
<v Speaker 5>good morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:40.250
<v Speaker 5>And everybody feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just a nice little thing like </v>

2095
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.250
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

2096
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.680
<v Speaker 5>Those are those men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those spread,</v>

2097
01:39:40.681 --> 01:39:43.650
<v Speaker 5>that person might do it to the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>person they meet and then boom,</v>

2098
01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 5>everybody's saying hi to everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's hugging everybody.</v>

2099
01:39:46.590 --> 01:39:48.020
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:53.140
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We talk about this probably every time </v>

2101
01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.421
<v Speaker 6>because we both agree that this is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably if there was going to be a </v>

2102
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.710
<v Speaker 6>nonviolent revolution in this country </v>
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't based on voting,</v>

2103
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.420
<v Speaker 6>it's going to start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2104
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:04.280
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2105
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:06.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in what is that,</v>

2106
01:40:06.230 --> 01:40:06.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2107
01:40:06.951 --> 01:40:10.460
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing I'm being taught is that thing</v>

2108
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:15.461
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can be cultivated and refined so you </v>

2109
01:40:15.461 --> 01:40:18.080
<v Speaker 6>can sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why it's called a practice.</v>

2110
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.960
<v Speaker 6>Like when you're sitting and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>watching your breath and you're learning</v>

2111
01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:24.860
<v Speaker 6>how to be in the moment instead of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking,</v>

2112
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:29.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing this for this reason or that </v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm doing this because when I'm </v>

2113
01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:32.000
<v Speaker 6>like talking to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to think I'm spiritual.</v>

2114
01:40:32.001 --> 01:40:33.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing this because I want to be more</v>
<v Speaker 6>focused.</v>

2115
01:40:33.591 --> 01:40:35.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing this because I have an anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 6>disorder.</v>

2116
01:40:35.721 --> 01:40:37.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing this because of this or that.</v>

2117
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.520
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's another reason to do it,</v>

2118
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:42.230
<v Speaker 6>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2119
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.800
<v Speaker 6>if you get really good at being in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment with people and also when you're </v>

2120
01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.990
<v Speaker 6>sitting with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2121
01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 6>and learning who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to start applying a lot of </v>

2122
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:56.970
<v Speaker 6>compassion to yourself because you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to sit man and you're going to.</v>

2123
01:40:57.010 --> 01:41:02.010
<v Speaker 6>Some shit's going to float to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>surface of the stream that you wish had </v>

2124
01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:02.770
<v Speaker 6>stayed under some rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

2125
01:41:02.771 --> 01:41:05.770
<v Speaker 6>you're going to see not just shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>been done to you,</v>

2126
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.400
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to see shit that you've</v>
<v Speaker 6>done other people and you're going to </v>

2127
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:11.400
<v Speaker 6>have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2128
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.870
<v Speaker 6>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the way to deal with that is,</v>

2129
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:15.850
<v Speaker 6>is not to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you do this at all,</v>

2130
01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:20.350
<v Speaker 6>but sometimes like I will remember </v>
<v Speaker 6>something from when I was very young and</v>

2131
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fucking Dick.</v>

2132
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:27.390
<v Speaker 6>I'll say it out loud to nobody yelling </v>
<v Speaker 6>does someone like 15 years ago,</v>

2133
01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:32.671
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yelling at you at my past self like you </v>

2134
01:41:32.671 --> 01:41:32.671
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2135
01:41:32.671 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 6>what have you got me into with my </v>
<v Speaker 6>memory's Jesus Christ ban?</v>

2136
01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 6>Why were you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why did you do that?</v>

2137
01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:41.610
<v Speaker 6>And so that's like the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 6>compassion for the self.</v>

2138
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>

2139
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:48.331
<v Speaker 6>the point is if you can like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultivate compassion for who you are </v>

2140
01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:53.401
<v Speaker 6>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not to say use that as an excuse </v>

2141
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:59.580
<v Speaker 6>to not try to become a kinder person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm saying cultivate compassion for </v>

2142
01:41:59.580 --> 01:41:59.770
<v Speaker 6>the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2143
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:05.250
<v Speaker 6>your dad had ptsd and you're fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 6>folks got divorced when you were three </v>

2144
01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:13.680
<v Speaker 6>and your dad remarried an abusive woman </v>
<v Speaker 6>who hated your fucking guts for seven </v>

2145
01:42:16.661 --> 01:42:21.661
<v Speaker 6>fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she did some really bad things to </v>

2146
01:42:21.661 --> 01:42:25.501
<v Speaker 6>you over the course of that time that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you are way too young to process or you </v>

2147
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 6>had no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you had no way to deal with that and now</v>

2148
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:33.070
<v Speaker 6>when you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in your twenties or thirties,</v>

2149
01:42:33.071 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 6>you're realizing that you seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of a selfish cunt.</v>

2150
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:38.140
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2151
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:43.141
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason you're being a selfish quote </v>

2152
01:42:43.141 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 6>comment is because you had to build up a</v>
<v Speaker 6>very high powered defense mechanism to </v>

2153
01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.920
<v Speaker 6>deal with the fact that you were abused </v>
<v Speaker 6>for almost a decade when your brain was </v>

2154
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 6>forming more neurons than it ever will </v>
<v Speaker 6>at any other point in its life.</v>

2155
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:58.990
<v Speaker 6>And now we can start having compassion </v>
<v Speaker 6>for ourselves.</v>

2156
01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:00.700
<v Speaker 6>Instead of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a selfish cunt.</v>

2157
01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:04.090
<v Speaker 6>We could think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2158
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:09.450
<v Speaker 6>I've got too big a force field up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've developed a thing to protect me </v>

2159
01:43:10.121 --> 01:43:12.220
<v Speaker 6>from an environment that I'm no longer </v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

2160
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:16.820
<v Speaker 6>And then the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once you start becoming compassionate to</v>

2161
01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.840
<v Speaker 6>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when you run into the person </v>

2162
01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.290
<v Speaker 6>who's being a selfish cunt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who you can look at and say,</v>

2163
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.730
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see you.</v>

2164
01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 6>I know you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it was.</v>

2165
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was an abusive </v>
<v Speaker 6>parent.</v>

2166
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was a heartbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's something you read.</v>

2167
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was something I don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

2168
01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.100
<v Speaker 6>Maybe genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2169
01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:47.670
<v Speaker 6>but I know from looking into myself </v>
<v Speaker 6>enough to know that you deserve more </v>

2170
01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:49.360
<v Speaker 6>compassion than you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2171
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 6>So we have this agreement that everybody</v>

2172
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 1>can learn up to a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2173
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.560
<v Speaker 1>We agree that pretty much everyone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal and not impaired mentally can </v>

2174
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:02.240
<v Speaker 1>learn how to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2175
01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>We agree this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we agree to this.</v>

2176
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I think say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2177
01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:09.760
<v Speaker 1>we agree to simple mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can learn how to add and </v>

2178
01:44:09.831 --> 01:44:14.831
<v Speaker 1>subtract and multiply and after that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a little squirrely with division </v>

2179
01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.480
<v Speaker 1>people can't come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're.</v>

2180
01:44:16.481 --> 01:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>We're agreeing that with minimal paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention in school,</v>

2181
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.340
<v Speaker 1>we could all achieve a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2182
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's very little very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention ever paid to considering how </v>

2183
01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:34.241
<v Speaker 1>you behave and how you think and how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>observe yourself and how you correct </v>

2184
01:44:34.241 --> 01:44:35.630
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and how you learn from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

2185
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It's never taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important things </v>

2186
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I've ever learned in my life is to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not cling onto the past,</v>

2187
01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but don't forget it either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2188
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Remember that you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it again,</v>

2189
01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but don't live in this world of 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago or 30 years ago or whatever.</v>

2190
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:57.950
<v Speaker 1>That one instance where you wish you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't say this one thing to some person</v>

2191
01:44:57.951 --> 01:45:02.951
<v Speaker 1>or hit some person or drive your car </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you should and whatever the fuck </v>

2192
01:45:02.951 --> 01:45:02.951
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2193
01:45:02.951 --> 01:45:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Whatever thing that it was that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>still sit back and go,</v>

2194
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2195
01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2196
01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I rear ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wants with my car when I was on</v>

2197
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:16.091
<v Speaker 1>my way to selling it and I wasn't paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention at a red light and my scars.</v>

2198
01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a 1978 oldsmobile cutlass</v>

2199
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and the front end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crunched this guy's bumper with the </v>

2200
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:28.880
<v Speaker 1>fiberglass part of my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do shit to his car.</v>

2201
01:45:28.881 --> 01:45:33.881
<v Speaker 1>He had a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fucked up my car on the way to </v>

2202
01:45:33.881 --> 01:45:37.691
<v Speaker 1>selling it and I brought it to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and the grill was like half </v>

2203
01:45:37.691 --> 01:45:38.300
<v Speaker 1>hanging off and I remember in my car </v>
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>

2204
01:45:38.301 --> 01:45:40.260
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2205
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking.</v>

2206
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so broke and such a loser.</v>

2207
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely keeping it together and on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to selling this car,</v>

2208
01:45:47.421 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I fucked it up and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking loser.</v>

2209
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being in my car screaming at </v>

2210
01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking loser.</v>

2211
01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 1>And I remember the guy bought it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just took a bunch of money off of it.</v>

2212
01:45:59.601 --> 01:46:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I forget what we agreed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2213
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:06.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this feeling would haunt me for </v>

2214
01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for months.</v>

2215
01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:11.651
<v Speaker 1>I'd be doing other things and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of rear ended that car not paying </v>

2216
01:46:11.651 --> 01:46:12.800
<v Speaker 1>attention fucking up the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2217
01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't even like an accident.</v>

2218
01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It was like I left my foot off the gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just slammed into somebody </v>

2219
01:46:21.610 --> 01:46:22.360
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2220
01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I let my foot off the brake rather.</v>

2221
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something that I literally was </v>

2222
01:46:31.450 --> 01:46:34.211
<v Speaker 1>defining myself by for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that I was a loser </v>

2223
01:46:34.211 --> 01:46:35.060
<v Speaker 1>because I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it right there.</v>

2225
01:46:37.281 --> 01:46:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey asshole,</v>

2226
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.180
<v Speaker 1>don't let your foot off the brake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention what you're doing.</v>

2227
01:46:41.181 --> 01:46:43.880
<v Speaker 1>You're driving a fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're only 18,</v>

2228
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but pay attention to what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

2229
01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that it was you fucking you </v>

2230
01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:50.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

2231
01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:53.700
<v Speaker 6>loser.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Screaming at myself,</v>

2232
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:55.650
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to this,</v>

2233
01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:57.810
<v Speaker 6>this dude at one of these randazzo </v>
<v Speaker 6>retreats.</v>

2234
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:01.850
<v Speaker 6>He's like in his twenties and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2235
01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

2236
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:05.580
<v Speaker 6>this wasn't a row.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like really,</v>

2237
01:47:05.581 --> 01:47:08.400
<v Speaker 6>like veiling the person very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very deeply here.</v>

2238
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.640
<v Speaker 6>But the point is this person was telling</v>
<v Speaker 6>me some shitty thing that had happened </v>

2239
01:47:13.921 --> 01:47:15.450
<v Speaker 6>to them when they were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2240
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:21.140
<v Speaker 6>And a real young and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it happened like at a,</v>

2241
01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 6>at a doctor's office.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The doctor,</v>

2242
01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 6>like it was like a shitty doctor or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

2243
01:47:27.361 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the doctor like slap,</v>

2244
01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 6>slap the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2245
01:47:31.531 --> 01:47:32.700
<v Speaker 6>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.440
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2247
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:36.690
<v Speaker 6>for what reason?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2248
01:47:36.691 --> 01:47:41.691
<v Speaker 6>there's no reason is there joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's really no reason to slap a </v>

2249
01:47:41.691 --> 01:47:41.691
<v Speaker 6>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's come to a doctor's office.</v>

2250
01:47:41.691 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for sure.</v>

2251
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:44.440
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the reasonable thing?</v>

2252
01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:46.800
<v Speaker 6>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing my friend said.</v>

2253
01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 6>My friend said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2254
01:47:49.441 --> 01:47:51.940
<v Speaker 6>I was squirming around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Geez.</v>

2255
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:57.920
<v Speaker 6>He hadn't considered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He hadn't even considered that he was </v>

2256
01:47:59.161 --> 01:48:01.320
<v Speaker 6>five.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like I said to him,</v>

2257
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:02.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

2258
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:07.850
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When was the last time you picked up a </v>

2259
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:09.771
<v Speaker 6>five year old?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how small five-year-olds </v>

2260
01:48:09.771 --> 01:48:13.220
<v Speaker 6>are?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you understand that you didn't do </v>

2261
01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.210
<v Speaker 6>anything wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did that was a shitty doctor that was a </v>

2262
01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:21.411
<v Speaker 6>crazy fucking doctor and your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 6>to rationalize the fact that sometimes </v>

2263
01:48:22.330 --> 01:48:26.100
<v Speaker 6>big people are crazy and slap little </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2264
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:31.310
<v Speaker 6>You tried to apply some logic or like </v>
<v Speaker 6>tilt to the act itself right now,</v>

2265
01:48:32.971 --> 01:48:37.050
<v Speaker 6>that's a heavy burden to carry because </v>
<v Speaker 6>if you think you're a bad five-year-old,</v>

2266
01:48:37.051 --> 01:48:38.760
<v Speaker 6>you're probably going to think you're a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad 30.</v>

2267
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:41.190
<v Speaker 6>God knows are going to think you're a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad 35 year old.</v>

2268
01:48:41.191 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 6>All the crazy shit you can do when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're 35.</v>

2269
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.800
<v Speaker 6>So it's like that mentality of looking </v>
<v Speaker 6>back on our former self and hating it is</v>

2270
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:56.730
<v Speaker 6>the very same reason that we hate </v>
<v Speaker 6>others.</v>

2271
01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.600
<v Speaker 6>It's identical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I'm going to hate myself,</v>

2272
01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.440
<v Speaker 6>definitely I'm giving myself permission.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eight everybody else around me.</v>

2273
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:09.830
<v Speaker 6>And that's so the work is let's figure </v>
<v Speaker 6>out how to like be compassionate to our </v>

2274
01:49:12.061 --> 01:49:17.061
<v Speaker 6>former selves and not just when we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking kids in a doctor's office and </v>

2275
01:49:17.061 --> 01:49:18.810
<v Speaker 6>not just 10 years ago and not just 20 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago,</v>

2276
01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:22.230
<v Speaker 6>like start and start now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like right now,</v>

2277
01:49:22.231 --> 01:49:27.231
<v Speaker 6>because you're sitting on top of a card </v>
<v Speaker 6>house made of memory.</v>

2278
01:49:27.631 --> 01:49:28.970
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's like that.</v>

2279
01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:33.980
<v Speaker 6>You're the entire thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you got to love it all and then then </v>

2280
01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:37.791
<v Speaker 6>if you start doing that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have noticed your degree of country </v>

2281
01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.880
<v Speaker 6>drops by a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to go away.</v>

2282
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.310
<v Speaker 6>It will definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least for me,</v>

2283
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:52.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that we've,</v>

2284
01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 5>I've had many guys asked me before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you,</v>

2285
01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.680
<v Speaker 5>why are you so insistent on exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big one.</v>

2286
01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.450
<v Speaker 5>Do you really think it helps you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2287
01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:03.520
<v Speaker 5>I know it helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want.</v>

2288
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 5>It's like jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the body,</v>

2289
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 5>like instead of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2290
01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:12.820
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing that you get when you jerk </v>

2291
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.941
<v Speaker 5>off this relief from the need for sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an noticed tension that's </v>

2292
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 5>constantly in your bio that flavors the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way you think about things.</v>

2293
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:21.670
<v Speaker 5>It really just does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2294
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:24.580
<v Speaker 5>last night my daughter was upset at </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2295
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:27.280
<v Speaker 5>She had gotten to a little tiffed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of her friends,</v>

2296
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:33.030
<v Speaker 5>super upset and really her friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she thought her friend was being mean </v>

2297
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.030
<v Speaker 5>and just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2298
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:36.320
<v Speaker 5>trying to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went into the garage and uh,</v>

2299
01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:37.690
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just go.</v>

2300
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 5>We'll work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll feel better.</v>

2301
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:43.830
<v Speaker 5>And I put the pads on and we started </v>
<v Speaker 5>moving around,</v>

2302
01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 5>start throwing some kicks and punches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start breaking a sweat.</v>

2303
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:49.690
<v Speaker 5>Really getting into whap whap whap and </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting him,</v>

2304
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:50.560
<v Speaker 5>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is fun.</v>

2305
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:55.740
<v Speaker 5>And then laughing and joking around and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then we talked about it because I'm </v>

2306
01:50:55.931 --> 01:51:00.931
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you can talk about it rationally </v>

2307
01:51:00.931 --> 01:51:00.931
<v Speaker 5>because now it's not fucking with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2308
01:51:00.931 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 5>You have this energy that's pent up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:51:02.021 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 5>You got to let that energy out and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're left with the thoughts.</v>

2310
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 5>But too many people get stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy and the thought and the energy is</v>

2311
01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:10.090
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

2312
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.380
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking emotional.</v>

2313
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I run around the block or a fucking </v>

2314
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:19.531
<v Speaker 5>hitting the heavy bag or hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pads or skip some grub or whatever </v>

2315
01:51:19.531 --> 01:51:19.600
<v Speaker 5>you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take a yoga class.</v>

2316
01:51:19.601 --> 01:51:20.290
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you wind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2317
01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:24.380
<v Speaker 5>drain the stress out of the body and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then look at the object and the,</v>

2318
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 5>the idea for what it is.</v>

2319
01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:31.260
<v Speaker 5>And this is a fucking important method </v>
<v Speaker 5>of managing the way you think about </v>

2320
01:51:31.721 --> 01:51:36.721
<v Speaker 5>things that people overlook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They overlook the impact of physical </v>

2321
01:51:36.721 --> 01:51:38.650
<v Speaker 5>tension on the body and your decision </v>
<v Speaker 5>making process.</v>

2322
01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

2323
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do do you a.</v>

2324
01:51:40.911 --> 01:51:43.370
<v Speaker 5>do you believe that trauma is stored in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the body?</v>

2325
01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:45.080
<v Speaker 5>You think that's bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2326
01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:50.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that trauma is something that </v>

2327
01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:52.440
<v Speaker 5>clings inside your subconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your subconsciousness is a part of your </v>

2328
01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your consciousness supposedly resides in</v>

2329
01:51:53.231 --> 01:51:58.231
<v Speaker 5>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why wouldn't it be in your body </v>

2330
01:51:58.231 --> 01:51:58.231
<v Speaker 5>somehow way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shape or form,</v>

2331
01:51:58.231 --> 01:51:58.231
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2332
01:51:58.231 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 5>there's also the idea that there's parts</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your body that retained memory,</v>

2333
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:06.990
<v Speaker 5>not just your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's neurons in your body and </v>

2334
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:11.701
<v Speaker 5>perhaps they retain memory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's the concept that this </v>

2335
01:52:11.701 --> 01:52:12.580
<v Speaker 5>apparent there's some type of neuron in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the heart,</v>

2336
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.790
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2337
01:52:13.791 --> 01:52:18.791
<v Speaker 5>And this is what a lot of people believe</v>
<v Speaker 5>was responsible for this idea of like </v>

2338
01:52:18.791 --> 01:52:20.950
<v Speaker 5>follow your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow your heart.</v>

2339
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if those are your memories and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2340
01:52:23.371 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 5>your database of collective emotional </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

2341
01:52:25.961 --> 01:52:30.961
<v Speaker 5>If there's really something to that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe it's not just in the brain </v>

2342
01:52:30.961 --> 01:52:32.980
<v Speaker 5>area but also in the heart area and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the neurons.</v>

2343
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just think because our consciousness </v>

2344
01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:38.380
<v Speaker 5>resides in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that all of our memories reside there as</v>

2345
01:52:38.381 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 5>well and that they're not in various </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas of our body.</v>

2346
01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.540
<v Speaker 5>People that get transplants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2347
01:52:43.541 --> 01:52:45.310
<v Speaker 5>one of the weird things that they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2348
01:52:45.370 --> 01:52:50.370
<v Speaker 5>they find that they have cravings for </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like the person who donated the </v>

2349
01:52:50.370 --> 01:52:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2350
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's real or not </v>

2351
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 5>because obviously I've never gone </v>
<v Speaker 5>through a transplant,</v>

2352
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2353
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that shit a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2354
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.250
<v Speaker 2>and someone was explaining it to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2355
01:53:00.251 --> 01:53:01.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2356
01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here comes fucking Bro.</v>

2358
01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Dr Trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fucking masters degree in </v>

2360
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science.</v>

2361
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2365
01:53:19.121 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ice House?</v>

2366
01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

2367
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much though on.</v>

2368
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking before I do my bro </v>
<v Speaker 2>Science thing,</v>

2369
01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:33.040
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your daughter's fucking lucky.</v>

2370
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:38.340
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Your Dad's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the gym in the House and </v>

2371
01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:41.590
<v Speaker 2>fucking kickbox you're upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's super cool man.</v>

2372
01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing.</v>

2373
01:53:43.211 --> 01:53:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Well it's</v>

2374
01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:46.660
<v Speaker 5>only cool if they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is she likes to do it.</v>

2375
01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:50.290
<v Speaker 5>This is one thing that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely important because I see people</v>

2376
01:53:50.291 --> 01:53:53.560
<v Speaker 5>that get their son to play football </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they played football and the kid</v>

2377
01:53:53.561 --> 01:53:55.440
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to play fucking football.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:53:55.810 --> 01:54:00.810
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to let your kids be who they </v>

2379
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:00.810
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get super resentful.</v>

2380
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:02.950
<v Speaker 5>I've seen people raise their kids and </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to force their kids into holes.</v>

2381
01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:06.100
<v Speaker 5>You got to support them and love them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and let them find their path.</v>

2382
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.200
<v Speaker 5>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to let them find their path.</v>

2383
01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:13.260
<v Speaker 5>You can't decide they're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>doctor or decide they're going to be a </v>

2384
01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.961
<v Speaker 5>lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Decide they're going to be whatever the </v>

2385
01:54:15.961 --> 01:54:15.961
<v Speaker 5>fuck you want them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They they got to be what they are.</v>

2386
01:54:15.961 --> 01:54:20.820
<v Speaker 5>We're all so different and you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally robbing a kid of their future.</v>

2387
01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:27.420
<v Speaker 5>If you over influence their choice </v>
<v Speaker 5>making in terms of like not following </v>

2388
01:54:27.791 --> 01:54:30.340
<v Speaker 5>their passion or their dream or their </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

2389
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 5>You and it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is to say that it can't be done</v>

2390
01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:40.860
<v Speaker 5>is it's all so many people can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many people don't get their </v>

2391
01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.611
<v Speaker 5>doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many people don't ever become </v>

2392
01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:46.600
<v Speaker 5>scientists or astronauts or fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematicians.</v>

2393
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:48.220
<v Speaker 5>A lot of things are hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2394
01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:49.090
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of things.</v>

2395
01:54:49.091 --> 01:54:54.091
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't decide the way that kids </v>

2396
01:54:54.091 --> 01:54:54.091
<v Speaker 5>brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not in there,</v>

2397
01:54:54.091 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not in there and it's different </v>

2398
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 5>than yours and hers is different than </v>
<v Speaker 5>his right.</v>

2399
01:54:58.370 --> 01:55:00.580
<v Speaker 5>His brother is different than this </v>
<v Speaker 5>sister and the mom is different than all</v>

2400
01:55:00.581 --> 01:55:03.280
<v Speaker 5>of them and you've got to let people be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to let them be.</v>

2401
01:55:03.570 --> 01:55:08.570
<v Speaker 5>You have to in people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those fucking people hate their </v>

2402
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.570
<v Speaker 5>parents.</v>

2403
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Those people did to develop this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>resentment because there's no freedom </v>

2404
01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.190
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking mom is always on.</v>

2405
01:55:14.191 --> 01:55:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm mom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that.</v>

2406
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:18.340
<v Speaker 5>You just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I raised you.</v>

2407
01:55:18.341 --> 01:55:20.200
<v Speaker 5>I didn't raise you to talk to me like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2408
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:23.350
<v Speaker 5>You're my son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you being a loser.</v>

2409
01:55:23.351 --> 01:55:23.950
<v Speaker 5>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will get it.</v>

2410
01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.090
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2411
01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.880
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2412
01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:55:28.690 --> 01:55:31.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm so disappointed in you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know friends where their parents don't</v>

2414
01:55:31.301 --> 01:55:34.030
<v Speaker 5>talk to them anymore because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>changed majors.</v>

2415
01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they changed majors.</v>

2416
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:39.490
<v Speaker 5>A Dad stop talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What side?</v>

2417
01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want.</v>

2418
01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:42.160
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to take on the company </v>
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>

2419
01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:43.580
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to take the company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have.</v>

2420
01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 5>The idea</v>

2421
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:49.070
<v Speaker 1>was we were going to send you to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>school when you were going to take over </v>

2422
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:49.070
<v Speaker 1>the company business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2423
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in a band you fucking loser.</v>

2424
01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 6>Some people have a really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like we got to be so much kinder to</v>

2425
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:58.020
<v Speaker 6>people when you just think in shit like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that helps you understand how people are</v>

2426
01:55:58.021 --> 01:56:00.450
<v Speaker 6>like you run into just about anybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2427
01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:05.451
<v Speaker 6>and it's like so easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have someone in your life and enjoy </v>

2428
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:09.420
<v Speaker 6>the idea that they're an asshole and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they deserve it,</v>

2429
01:56:09.421 --> 01:56:13.290
<v Speaker 6>but if you spend just a speck of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about it,</v>

2430
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:16.590
<v Speaker 6>it's like if we really sat in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

2431
01:56:16.591 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 6>it sucks.</v>

2432
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll just wait until you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it gets really,</v>

2433
01:56:20.641 --> 01:56:25.641
<v Speaker 1>really interesting because you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at people like they used to be </v>

2434
01:56:25.641 --> 01:56:26.100
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to me.</v>

2435
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and man,</v>

2436
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 1>are you do I don't like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2437
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:33.660
<v Speaker 1>this is the first place I've said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Daddy.</v>

2438
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:36.210
<v Speaker 6>She said it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know you get when,</v>

2439
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 6>when you're in the early Montero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know</v>

2440
01:56:39.610 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if you're scared,</v>

2441
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it's such a sacred thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2442
01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a vulnerable thing to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel vulnerable.</v>

2443
01:56:47.761 --> 01:56:52.761
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel nervous and because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy or you're worried about </v>

2444
01:56:52.761 --> 01:56:52.950
<v Speaker 1>talking to fucking love it,</v>

2445
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.770
<v Speaker 6>it is the most transformative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2446
01:56:55.771 --> 01:57:00.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you hear all the time to the point </v>

2447
01:57:00.771 --> 01:57:03.090
<v Speaker 6>where I was like suspicious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I was like,</v>

2448
01:57:03.110 --> 01:57:08.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't stand up has done this job for </v>

2449
01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:08.110
<v Speaker 6>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I think I'm allowed to say I urge you</v>

2450
01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:09.620
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>should I not even what's,</v>

2451
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.050
<v Speaker 6>what's the.</v>

2452
01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:57:10.931 --> 01:57:12.220
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His old stuff.</v>

2454
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:15.730
<v Speaker 6>He's got some of my favorite jokes of </v>
<v Speaker 6>all time.</v>

2455
01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.940
<v Speaker 6>Many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he's got this killer fucking joke </v>

2456
01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:24.510
<v Speaker 6>about Alva like a pregnant people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>like heroin addicts,</v>

2457
01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.110
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

2458
01:57:26.111 --> 01:57:27.460
<v Speaker 6>just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll love it.</v>

2459
01:57:27.461 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 6>Just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then.</v>

2460
01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:30.650
<v Speaker 6>And then when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2461
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're stuck,</v>

2462
01:57:32.021 --> 01:57:34.480
<v Speaker 6>you're trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is how I used to think.</v>

2463
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:39.990
<v Speaker 6>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so humbling to realize that all </v>

2464
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:44.710
<v Speaker 6>this shit you heard that was true in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sense that you hear people say,</v>

2465
01:57:44.711 --> 01:57:46.960
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's psychedelic psychedelic.</v>

2466
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:51.990
<v Speaker 6>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always associated that with like when </v>

2467
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:54.670
<v Speaker 6>the baby's born,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there must be some serotonin or dopamine</v>

2468
01:57:54.671 --> 01:57:56.320
<v Speaker 6>that gets released,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just in the woman.</v>

2469
01:57:56.321 --> 01:58:01.030
<v Speaker 6>We know the woman's brain is flooded </v>
<v Speaker 6>with oxytocin and a variety of things.</v>

2470
01:58:01.031 --> 01:58:03.100
<v Speaker 6>The mother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bonding chemicals,</v>

2471
01:58:03.101 --> 01:58:04.570
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought,</v>

2472
01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:06.520
<v Speaker 6>well that clearly would happen for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>father,</v>

2473
01:58:06.521 --> 01:58:07.930
<v Speaker 6>maybe just not in the same level.</v>

2474
01:58:07.930 --> 01:58:10.600
<v Speaker 6>So when people say it's Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that must be what they meet,</v>

2475
01:58:11.530 --> 01:58:15.550
<v Speaker 6>but now I know you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the birth is,</v>

2476
01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:20.620
<v Speaker 6>hasn't happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just being in the presence of a </v>

2477
01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.641
<v Speaker 6>person who's growing a life inside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>their belly and realizing that like the </v>

2478
01:58:25.361 --> 01:58:29.830
<v Speaker 6>bonding that's happening there and like </v>
<v Speaker 6>the sacred duty is coming up.</v>

2479
01:58:29.831 --> 01:58:34.831
<v Speaker 6>If you being a father and that a soul is</v>
<v Speaker 6>coming into this dimension that is going</v>

2480
01:58:35.381 --> 01:58:40.381
<v Speaker 6>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm completely dependent on you and my </v>

2481
01:58:40.661 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 6>wife course wanting to keep her safe and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then man,</v>

2482
01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:49.320
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The combination of all these things is </v>

2483
01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:51.961
<v Speaker 6>so incredibly psychedelic and the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>beautiful way and so humbling because </v>

2484
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

2485
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 6>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did I fucking tell myself that.</v>

2486
01:58:58.901 --> 01:59:03.901
<v Speaker 6>I'd figured out something really smart </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that was like reproduction is a </v>

2487
01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:11.491
<v Speaker 6>trick of the DNA and this marriage thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the baby thing is some kind of vast </v>

2488
01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:18.340
<v Speaker 6>digital societal Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the opinion decks.</v>

2489
01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 6>We don't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing to it.</v>

2490
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 6>Obviously I wasn't using that voice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

2491
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:29.110
<v Speaker 6>it was such a pretentious fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>pompous,</v>

2492
01:59:29.111 --> 01:59:34.111
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous place that I was standing at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is to judge people for </v>

2493
01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:39.920
<v Speaker 6>reproducing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having,</v>

2494
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 6>enjoying the ability to judge because my</v>
<v Speaker 6>parents reproduced.</v>

2495
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:48.670
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's so humbling to realize like,</v>

2496
01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was wrong,</v>

2497
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 6>but I wasn't just like kinder on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I was deeply fundamentally,</v>

2498
01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:02.400
<v Speaker 6>completely wrong about this phase of </v>
<v Speaker 6>life in this.</v>

2499
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the word for it?</v>

2500
02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:06.280
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2501
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.840
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>

2502
02:00:07.841 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 6>in Hinduism they call it an Ostrom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a monastery.</v>

2503
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 6>It's called the Green Hosta Ostrom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a temple.</v>

2504
02:00:13.631 --> 02:00:15.790
<v Speaker 6>It's considered to be like a temple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The family.</v>

2505
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:19.510
<v Speaker 6>Holy Fuck Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's real.</v>

2506
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:22.120
<v Speaker 6>The rubbers hit the road man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>

2507
02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:24.880
<v Speaker 6>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really beautiful though,</v>

2508
02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:28.040
<v Speaker 5>obviously a little scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2509
02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.660
<v Speaker 5>it's love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's real love.</v>

2510
02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:35.690
<v Speaker 5>And it's love where you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be able to love your children </v>

2511
02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:37.800
<v Speaker 5>unconditionally in a in a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that we really have a hard time with</v>

2512
02:00:37.801 --> 02:00:42.801
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the thing about it is not </v>

2513
02:00:42.801 --> 02:00:45.210
<v Speaker 5>just that you're bringing a life into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this world which is very psychedelic,</v>

2514
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:49.080
<v Speaker 5>but that your love bond with this kid is</v>
<v Speaker 5>so ultimate.</v>

2515
02:00:49.170 --> 02:00:50.730
<v Speaker 5>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so intense.</v>

2516
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:54.870
<v Speaker 5>The love that you have for each other to</v>
<v Speaker 5>raising the kid together.</v>

2517
02:00:54.871 --> 02:00:59.871
<v Speaker 5>There's a thing that happens with people</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they are just really deeply </v>

2518
02:01:03.170 --> 02:01:08.170
<v Speaker 5>connected at a DNA level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is a little person that is </v>

2519
02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:13.570
<v Speaker 5>literally come out of nowhere from two </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies and it's.</v>

2520
02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.500
<v Speaker 5>It makes you realize how precious life </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2521
02:01:16.501 --> 02:01:21.501
<v Speaker 5>how vulnerable we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it makes you realize that it's such </v>

2522
02:01:21.501 --> 02:01:23.520
<v Speaker 5>a cliche phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the actual power of love.</v>

2523
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.690
<v Speaker 5>And then it's not just the love of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid or the love of yourselves,</v>

2524
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:32.040
<v Speaker 5>the two together and the family together</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the other people that you love.</v>

2525
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:34.410
<v Speaker 5>It's a love of all people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the love.</v>

2526
02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.680
<v Speaker 5>It's just if we just really have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>time loving people,</v>

2527
02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 5>we have a really hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people going to love us</v>

2528
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>back or they're not gonna get in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2529
02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be overly needy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying or they're not going to be </v>

2530
02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>intrusive or they're not going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you what to do,</v>

2531
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>which is why people hate their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents telling them what to do.</v>

2532
02:01:50.301 --> 02:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes with this bullshit.</v>

2533
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Love comes with this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love comes with fucking rules and I have</v>

2534
02:01:56.091 --> 02:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>to be annoyed all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to wear my suit on Sunday.</v>

2535
02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Fuck love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

2536
02:02:01.341 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that carries on.</v>

2537
02:02:03.411 --> 02:02:08.411
<v Speaker 1>You develop these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shields that you put up for the </v>

2538
02:02:08.411 --> 02:02:08.411
<v Speaker 1>whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that.</v>

2539
02:02:08.411 --> 02:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most common things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people do when,</v>

2540
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>when in terms of like our definitions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

2541
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.770
<v Speaker 1>we define it by the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be the lovers in our lives,</v>

2542
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>but they'll just unconditional kindness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and love so so few people are balanced.</v>

2543
02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just lust and then after awhile you</v>

2544
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>get annoyed with each other and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to get free and find somebody</v>

2545
02:02:28.611 --> 02:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>else who's going to make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't make you happy either.</v>

2546
02:02:31.161 --> 02:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>And most of us in the early years of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in particular,</v>

2547
02:02:34.791 --> 02:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we bounce around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2548
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:41.350
<v Speaker 1>we try to find a new person that's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>make us happy and we attract the kind of</v>

2549
02:02:42.861 --> 02:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>people that are the most destructive for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2550
02:02:45.411 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean for some strange reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always looking to be distracted.</v>

2551
02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I think when you can learn how </v>

2552
02:02:54.081 --> 02:02:59.081
<v Speaker 1>to abandon that and it's not a learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now I know it's a slow gradual </v>

2553
02:02:59.081 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>process where the instances of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous occur less frequently,</v>

2554
02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less and less and less and less </v>

2555
02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>frequently to your more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more kind.</v>

2556
02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2557
02:03:08.591 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you get it as good as you can get it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on any given day.</v>

2558
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of being the hairless </v>
<v Speaker 1>ape in this strange land of electronics </v>

2559
02:03:17.691 --> 02:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and concrete buildings.</v>

2560
02:03:20.250 --> 02:03:25.250
<v Speaker 1>We're still trying to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules to this completely new way of </v>

2561
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:28.541
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of this completely new way of </v>

2562
02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:30.851
<v Speaker 1>living has shifted over the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and that's where the Internet </v>

2563
02:03:30.851 --> 02:03:30.851
<v Speaker 1>comes in the last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

2564
02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>no more than 24 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole world's changed topsy turvy up</v>

2565
02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:38.930
<v Speaker 1>to down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing is just different</v>

2566
02:03:38.931 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different reality.</v>

2567
02:03:40.791 --> 02:03:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Anybody from any point in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you transport them to today,</v>

2568
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>they'd be living in some fucking blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner movie.</v>

2569
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is a Ridley Scott Film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know for sure.</v>

2570
02:03:53.061 --> 02:03:58.061
<v Speaker 1>If you were living in the 19 fifties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone brought you to 2018 and picked </v>

2571
02:03:58.061 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you up from the airport and a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a plane.</v>

2572
02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Seems normal playing just like planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are these screens on the seats?</v>

2573
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And screens in the seats and someone </v>

2574
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>picks you up in a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any noise.</v>

2575
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:13.511
<v Speaker 1>It's electric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant laptop in the front of </v>

2576
02:04:13.511 --> 02:04:15.761
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows this huge map and you're </v>

2577
02:04:15.761 --> 02:04:16.520
<v Speaker 1>driving around and people are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone calls in the air.</v>

2578
02:04:16.590 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2579
02:04:17.211 --> 02:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>what's up Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2580
02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking in the car?</v>

2581
02:04:19.611 --> 02:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2582
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>driving around to all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and you see the,</v>

2583
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:30.431
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mass of humans and the architecture </v>

2584
02:04:30.431 --> 02:04:32.891
<v Speaker 1>change and people would freak the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with the and this is the world that </v>

2585
02:04:32.891 --> 02:04:34.910
<v Speaker 1>we've totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely become accustomed to.</v>

2586
02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one,</v>

2587
02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:40.460
<v Speaker 1>no one's for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all just playing it on ear and the</v>

2588
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:45.500
<v Speaker 1>worst aspects of it that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and those social upheaval and the </v>

2589
02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>way the being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infighting between people,</v>

2590
02:04:49.141 --> 02:04:54.141
<v Speaker 1>people getting kicked out of restaurants</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they work for the wrong people </v>

2591
02:04:54.141 --> 02:04:54.141
<v Speaker 1>and put this.</v>

2592
02:04:54.141 --> 02:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>If you see maxine waters telling people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you find people that it worked </v>

2593
02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>for the trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find them in a restaurant.</v>

2594
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.880
<v Speaker 1>You find them anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go and you get together a group of </v>

2595
02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:08.181
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You build a crowd and you let them know </v>

2596
02:05:08.181 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>that you don't agree with their policies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2597
02:05:08.341 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're calling for gangs were calling for</v>

2598
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>gangs of people randomly industry to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupt people's meals,</v>

2599
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:18.480
<v Speaker 1>interrupt people in stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a crowd together.</v>

2600
02:05:18.481 --> 02:05:23.481
<v Speaker 1>Don't let them be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Safe in public because you disagree </v>

2601
02:05:23.481 --> 02:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>with their policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

2602
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:26.970
<v Speaker 1>This is getting crazy and I know one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the policies of the immigrants,</v>

2603
02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:29.220
<v Speaker 1>the children of immigrants being </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from their parents,</v>

2604
02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:31.560
<v Speaker 1>which I'm 100 percent with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's immoral.</v>

2605
02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:36.561
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It saddens me that it's even considered </v>

2606
02:05:36.561 --> 02:05:36.810
<v Speaker 1>an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>

2607
02:05:36.811 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck if they broke the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

2608
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't take parents and kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate them.</v>

2609
02:05:41.101 --> 02:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just disgusting.</v>

2610
02:05:43.050 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying,</v>

2611
02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't have broke the law.</v>

2612
02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they shouldn't have broke the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to do something that's a </v>

2613
02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.770
<v Speaker 1>thousand times worse than crossing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>line that dirt,</v>

2614
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>that fucking imaginary line in the dirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossing.</v>

2615
02:05:55.621 --> 02:06:00.621
<v Speaker 1>That is nothing in comparison to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime of stealing a baby from its </v>

2616
02:06:00.621 --> 02:06:01.980
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

2617
02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>That's not American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 18.</v>

2618
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just insane and we wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that to Canadians.</v>

2619
02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Canadians came over here with their </v>

2620
02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute blond haired kids,</v>

2621
02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>just were not stealing them from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

2622
02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

2623
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:17.580
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos.</v>

2624
02:06:17.610 --> 02:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>So in one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one hand I understand where a lot of </v>

2625
02:06:22.610 --> 02:06:24.090
<v Speaker 1>people were outraged and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're coming from.</v>

2626
02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:27.000
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't separate parents from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>children in any way,</v>

2627
02:06:27.001 --> 02:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way to fix that,</v>

2628
02:06:28.891 --> 02:06:33.891
<v Speaker 1>as not saying anybody who's on that team</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working for that administration </v>

2629
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.070
<v Speaker 1>should be chased by a mob of street </v>
<v Speaker 1>vigilantes.</v>

2630
02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:40.620
<v Speaker 1>And you should encourage this mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a crowd,</v>

2631
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:42.480
<v Speaker 1>get everybody together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a crowd,</v>

2632
02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>make some noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them know they're not welcomed.</v>

2633
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2634
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:47.840
<v Speaker 2>well isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't like who.</v>

2635
02:06:47.841 --> 02:06:52.841
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems with it is now we </v>

2636
02:06:52.841 --> 02:06:55.600
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we let's,</v>

2637
02:06:55.680 --> 02:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to play mob justice ping </v>

2638
02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:02.410
<v Speaker 2>pong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2639
02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Because if I start playing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2640
02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:08.860
<v Speaker 2>they're not ping pong could potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn into a civil war.</v>

2641
02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you know there was a reason</v>

2642
02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>USA Today poll that said 31 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America thinks that we're close to a </v>

2643
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>civil war</v>

2644
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:19.290
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that being said no.</v>

2645
02:07:19.370 --> 02:07:23.600
<v Speaker 2>And also people who like fantasize about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a civil war,</v>

2646
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they've really thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out all the way,</v>

2647
02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:31.430
<v Speaker 2>like what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can answer that for you.</v>

2648
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:33.110
<v Speaker 2>They definitely have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2649
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 2>So definitely have it because if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did and they thought</v>

2650
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>it through and thought it was a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

2651
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:41.290
<v Speaker 1>they're out of their fucking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy or they're stupid.</v>

2652
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:42.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2653
02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.080
<v Speaker 6>but was really passionate about that and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that man.</v>

2654
02:07:46.081 --> 02:07:47.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean because he will,</v>

2655
02:07:47.061 --> 02:07:49.740
<v Speaker 6>he wants to fucking be in a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 6>civil war.</v>

2656
02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:51.120
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2657
02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:52.350
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2658
02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:56.200
<v Speaker 6>for me when I see shit like that going </v>
<v Speaker 6>down,</v>

2659
02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:58.770
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2660
02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:01.110
<v Speaker 6>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2661
02:08:01.111 --> 02:08:03.910
<v Speaker 6>I've like come up with like I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>come up with,</v>

2662
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 6>I got it from the Dalai Lama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've come up with like a good little</v>

2663
02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:13.081
<v Speaker 6>equation to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to go back to which is does this reduce </v>

2664
02:08:13.691 --> 02:08:14.950
<v Speaker 6>suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2665
02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.470
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I don't think it,</v>

2666
02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.520
<v Speaker 6>it reduces suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2667
02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:24.530
<v Speaker 6>and these people who are really upset on</v>
<v Speaker 6>both sides of the fence are suffering.</v>

2668
02:08:25.121 --> 02:08:30.121
<v Speaker 6>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're really looking at like a world </v>

2669
02:08:30.121 --> 02:08:32.431
<v Speaker 6>where a lot of people are deeply upset,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deeply suffering,</v>

2670
02:08:32.561 --> 02:08:35.440
<v Speaker 6>and really scared and really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

2671
02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 6>really freaking the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2672
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:42.570
<v Speaker 6>and as I've been watching this thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>emerge on the Internet,</v>

2673
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:48.270
<v Speaker 6>on twitter where people tweet things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that paint that you look at it and you </v>

2674
02:08:50.411 --> 02:08:55.411
<v Speaker 6>think it's almost as though you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>living in another world than I am like </v>

2675
02:08:55.411 --> 02:08:58.870
<v Speaker 6>the world that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about man,</v>

2676
02:08:58.871 --> 02:09:00.250
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking terrifying.</v>

2677
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:04.090
<v Speaker 6>Like it's scary and it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really fucked up.</v>

2678
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:09.091
<v Speaker 6>And maybe like the reason I think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is because I started doing lsd when I </v>

2679
02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:13.450
<v Speaker 6>was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so when I was,</v>

2680
02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:18.840
<v Speaker 6>when I was 16 I w r I became brutally </v>
<v Speaker 6>aware of the fact that the current </v>

2681
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:27.270
<v Speaker 6>government in the past government was </v>
<v Speaker 6>repressive and,</v>

2682
02:09:27.351 --> 02:09:28.070
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

2683
02:09:28.071 --> 02:09:33.071
<v Speaker 6>and something about that drug,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I don't do anymore because it's </v>

2684
02:09:33.071 --> 02:09:33.960
<v Speaker 6>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a crazy kid.</v>

2685
02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:39.260
<v Speaker 6>But something about that drug really </v>
<v Speaker 6>shows you the conditioning.</v>

2686
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:44.460
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I knew from a pretty young age,</v>

2687
02:09:44.461 --> 02:09:45.510
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh wow,</v>

2688
02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:47.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think the United States is,</v>

2689
02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:52.350
<v Speaker 6>is dropping bombs on other countries </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of justice or some threat.</v>

2690
02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.680
<v Speaker 6>It appears to be that some people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>making money off of this shit and I </v>

2691
02:09:57.781 --> 02:10:01.020
<v Speaker 6>don't think these drugs are illegal </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're bad for you.</v>

2692
02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:06.290
<v Speaker 6>I think they're illegal because somebody</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't want the herd to experience </v>

2693
02:10:09.361 --> 02:10:13.440
<v Speaker 6>these states of consciousness because it</v>
<v Speaker 6>will make them more difficult to share.</v>

2694
02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with Hamilton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morris yesterday and he strongly </v>

2695
02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:21.241
<v Speaker 1>disagrees because he's talked to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people actually in the dea if she's </v>

2696
02:10:21.241 --> 02:10:21.610
<v Speaker 1>talked to the people in drug and forest </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2697
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And he said that what really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening is they have zero experience </v>

2698
02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:30.451
<v Speaker 1>with these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know these drugs are illegal </v>

2699
02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:30.970
<v Speaker 1>and so they pursue it as if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable target.</v>

2700
02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about it in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem with law enforcement</v>

2701
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 5>being that it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always said that the real problem </v>

2702
02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:41.831
<v Speaker 5>with tops is not cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem with cops is human </v>

2703
02:10:41.831 --> 02:10:42.110
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a bad guy.</v>

2704
02:10:42.111 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 5>I get a point if I take him out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start looking for bad guys.</v>

2705
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.430
<v Speaker 5>He started looking for bad guys that </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't even there.</v>

2706
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 5>You start forcing situation.</v>

2707
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:48.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2708
02:10:48.621 --> 02:10:49.670
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know comes.</v>

2709
02:10:50.230 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

2710
02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:51.740
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>

2711
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.160
<v Speaker 6>We get into this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I and I don't mean the dea,</v>

2712
02:10:55.161 --> 02:10:57.170
<v Speaker 6>like I've heard the exact same thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the dea.</v>

2713
02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.120
<v Speaker 6>Like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2714
02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:01.130
<v Speaker 5>I think people above them have </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced.</v>

2715
02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:06.420
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even talking about people above </v>

2716
02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:07.120
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about tendencies.</v>

2717
02:11:07.150 --> 02:11:09.570
<v Speaker 6>So like if an individual has a tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2718
02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.150
<v Speaker 6>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tendency.</v>

2719
02:11:13.151 --> 02:11:16.510
<v Speaker 6>So a person has a tendency than a group </v>
<v Speaker 6>of people might have a tendency.</v>

2720
02:11:16.511 --> 02:11:21.511
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I get a group of Swedish people </v>

2721
02:11:21.511 --> 02:11:23.140
<v Speaker 6>together and I'd bring them to the World</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cup,</v>

2722
02:11:23.650 --> 02:11:26.260
<v Speaker 6>they're going to have the tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 6>cheer for Sweden.</v>

2723
02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:27.760
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to bet on that.</v>

2724
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:29.740
<v Speaker 6>I gamble on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a tendency,</v>

2725
02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:32.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>My boss fucking sucks.</v>

2726
02:11:32.741 --> 02:11:34.860
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2727
02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:40.230
<v Speaker 6>Then you think back to the way all your </v>
<v Speaker 6>other boss has acted and you realize </v>

2728
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:40.230
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

2729
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:44.221
<v Speaker 6>there seems to be a tendency when people</v>
<v Speaker 6>are in that position of power to behave </v>

2730
02:11:44.741 --> 02:11:46.100
<v Speaker 6>in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2731
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:47.950
<v Speaker 6>Hard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hard job.</v>

2732
02:11:48.010 --> 02:11:48.630
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

2733
02:11:48.670 --> 02:11:53.670
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the person who's in the position of </v>

2734
02:11:53.670 --> 02:11:54.850
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that thing coming from inside of them</v>

2735
02:11:54.851 --> 02:11:59.851
<v Speaker 6>or is it that there something like built</v>
<v Speaker 6>in to the DNA of a leadership position?</v>

2736
02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.700
<v Speaker 6>They say that like in the same way like </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you got a pregnant wife,</v>

2737
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.490
<v Speaker 6>some new thing kicks in and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading about it,</v>

2738
02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:11.520
<v Speaker 6>built in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like where it's like I'm </v>

2739
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:11.920
<v Speaker 6>getting a fucking security system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking like,</v>

2740
02:12:11.921 --> 02:12:12.610
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2741
02:12:12.611 --> 02:12:15.860
<v Speaker 6>I want to make her safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make sure that like we're,</v>

2742
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:17.860
<v Speaker 6>we're saving money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're like,</v>

2743
02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:19.990
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm working harder than I've ever worked</v>

2744
02:12:19.991 --> 02:12:24.991
<v Speaker 6>in my fucking life because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make sure that like there's plenty for </v>

2745
02:12:24.991 --> 02:12:25.870
<v Speaker 6>her and plenty for the kid and like </v>
<v Speaker 6>something kicks in.</v>

2746
02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:27.430
<v Speaker 6>There is a tendency there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2747
02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:32.820
<v Speaker 6>So what I'm saying is if there seems to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a tendency that happens when there is</v>

2748
02:12:35.021 --> 02:12:35.750
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2749
02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:38.800
<v Speaker 6>a convergence of people in power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2750
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:42.460
<v Speaker 6>It starts behaving in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It builds walls,</v>

2751
02:12:42.461 --> 02:12:46.150
<v Speaker 6>it starts taking people to jail who </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't belong in jail.</v>

2752
02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:50.200
<v Speaker 6>It dehumanizes essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the fucking tendency,</v>

2753
02:12:50.201 --> 02:12:55.201
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so when you're taking a psychedelic </v>

2754
02:12:55.201 --> 02:12:55.390
<v Speaker 6>and you look around and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2755
02:12:55.391 --> 02:13:00.391
<v Speaker 6>I see the government though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's filled with people who are </v>

2756
02:13:00.391 --> 02:13:04.651
<v Speaker 6>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are people in the fucking dea who </v>

2757
02:13:04.651 --> 02:13:05.440
<v Speaker 6>listened to your show and guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 6>love the show.</v>

2758
02:13:05.441 --> 02:13:06.730
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking right man.</v>

2759
02:13:06.731 --> 02:13:08.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to enforce these goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 6>laws.</v>

2760
02:13:08.711 --> 02:13:13.711
<v Speaker 6>Arresting people for a thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like being shown not only to be </v>

2761
02:13:13.711 --> 02:13:14.620
<v Speaker 6>harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but potentially therapeutic.</v>

2762
02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:20.190
<v Speaker 6>There's people in all branches of </v>
<v Speaker 6>government and there's some people who </v>

2763
02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:20.440
<v Speaker 6>just need a job and maybe there's some </v>
<v Speaker 6>assholes in there.</v>

2764
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some people that want to bus </v>

2765
02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:26.921
<v Speaker 5>crack dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to bust assholes that are </v>

2766
02:13:26.921 --> 02:13:26.921
<v Speaker 5>killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen to also be drug dealers.</v>

2767
02:13:26.921 --> 02:13:31.781
<v Speaker 5>And this is part of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm not talking about the individual </v>

2768
02:13:31.781 --> 02:13:32.400
<v Speaker 5>atomic structure</v>

2769
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:37.400
<v Speaker 6>of the power structure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about the sum total </v>

2770
02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:41.451
<v Speaker 6>convergence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gestalt of the thing imminate </v>

2771
02:13:41.451 --> 02:13:44.100
<v Speaker 6>certain behavior patterns and those </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking behavior patterns.</v>

2772
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:49.370
<v Speaker 6>Those behavior patterns have been going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on for a very long time and so forever,</v>

2773
02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:52.440
<v Speaker 6>forever as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's always been kings.</v>

2774
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 6>So now I'm not saying therefore your </v>
<v Speaker 6>fear,</v>

2775
02:13:56.071 --> 02:14:01.071
<v Speaker 6>your terror is unjustified.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think maybe because of the </v>

2776
02:14:01.071 --> 02:14:04.550
<v Speaker 6>garishness of the current administration</v>
<v Speaker 6>compared to like Obama who is like,</v>

2777
02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know what happened with Obama and,</v>

2778
02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 6>and I say we know what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 6>Obama and the drones.</v>

2779
02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:13.170
<v Speaker 6>We know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2780
02:14:13.171 --> 02:14:15.870
<v Speaker 6>we don't know what all the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably happened with Obama,</v>

2781
02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:21.050
<v Speaker 6>but we do know with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I remember hearing this and then </v>

2782
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.960
<v Speaker 6>looking it up and then looking it up </v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

2783
02:14:22.710 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he apparently liked deported.</v>

2784
02:14:24.841 --> 02:14:27.030
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe please find out if I'm wrong about</v>

2785
02:14:27.031 --> 02:14:27.230
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

2786
02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:30.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't have to deal with 7 billion </v>
<v Speaker 6>people calling me a fucking motherfucker</v>

2787
02:14:30.601 --> 02:14:35.601
<v Speaker 6>for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But apparently he deported more people </v>

2788
02:14:35.601 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 6>than any than all American presidents </v>
<v Speaker 6>combined.</v>

2789
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 6>His administration did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2790
02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:41.550
<v Speaker 6>Deported more people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2791
02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2792
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:42.810
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2793
02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:45.060
<v Speaker 6>and so now trump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2794
02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:47.810
<v Speaker 6>he's at the beginning of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>deportation race.</v>

2795
02:14:47.811 --> 02:14:52.811
<v Speaker 6>Like by the time he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might have beaten Obama and score by </v>

2796
02:14:52.811 --> 02:14:52.811
<v Speaker 6>a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't fucking know.</v>

2797
02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 6>But the main thing is what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>here is like,</v>

2798
02:14:55.890 --> 02:15:00.890
<v Speaker 6>I think I've been aware of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is something wonky going on and </v>

2799
02:15:01.741 --> 02:15:04.630
<v Speaker 6>it's wonky in the most rotten brutal </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2800
02:15:04.631 --> 02:15:07.830
<v Speaker 6>It's wonky in the sense that it kills </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2801
02:15:08.070 --> 02:15:11.970
<v Speaker 6>It separates children from families,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just of immigrants,</v>

2802
02:15:11.971 --> 02:15:16.971
<v Speaker 6>but if farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people were growing marijuana and </v>

2803
02:15:16.971 --> 02:15:19.500
<v Speaker 6>guaranteed their kids are in foster care</v>
<v Speaker 6>now and they're in fucking jail.</v>

2804
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:22.080
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This has been going on and on and on and</v>

2805
02:15:22.081 --> 02:15:27.081
<v Speaker 6>on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe now it's great about the </v>

2806
02:15:27.081 --> 02:15:29.871
<v Speaker 6>fear that we're seeing in the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 6>reaction is if there is anything great </v>

2807
02:15:29.871 --> 02:15:33.330
<v Speaker 6>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that people are waking up to the fact</v>

2808
02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:38.630
<v Speaker 6>that our government right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the American government is out of </v>

2809
02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:42.711
<v Speaker 6>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've been at war for 90 percent of our </v>

2810
02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:42.711
<v Speaker 6>history,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2811
02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:47.660
<v Speaker 6>and there's a lot of shit going on in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there that doesn't need to be going on </v>

2812
02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.830
<v Speaker 6>and we're waking up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just some people are like,</v>

2813
02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:55.040
<v Speaker 6>they're waking up to it like they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>asleep and someone threw water in their </v>

2814
02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:55.040
<v Speaker 6>face and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh fucking shit.</v>

2815
02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:57.360
<v Speaker 6>Holy fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is like,</v>

2816
02:15:57.660 --> 02:15:58.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this happened,</v>

2817
02:15:59.070 --> 02:16:01.080
<v Speaker 6>this sounds condescending.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean it to be,</v>

2818
02:16:01.081 --> 02:16:06.081
<v Speaker 6>but when I was like 18 or 17,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at a fucking dollar bell </v>

2819
02:16:06.081 --> 02:16:10.161
<v Speaker 6>tripping balls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at that fucking green pyramid </v>

2820
02:16:10.161 --> 02:16:10.650
<v Speaker 6>and the weird symbols and then thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2821
02:16:10.651 --> 02:16:13.330
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2822
02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.980
<v Speaker 6>this is covered with a cult symbology </v>
<v Speaker 6>all over it,</v>

2823
02:16:17.110 --> 02:16:18.510
<v Speaker 6>all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then thinking like,</v>

2824
02:16:18.511 --> 02:16:19.020
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

2825
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:21.660
<v Speaker 6>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this should,</v>

2826
02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:24.510
<v Speaker 6>this should,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this isn't really worth anything.</v>

2827
02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:27.960
<v Speaker 6>Like this is just paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then setting it on fire,</v>

2828
02:16:28.590 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to do like the worst</v>

2829
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:35.130
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a joke obviously because it's </v>

2830
02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:35.130
<v Speaker 2>illegal to set it on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2831
02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2832
02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never fucking do that man.</v>

2833
02:16:36.281 --> 02:16:41.281
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never ever in a million years would </v>

2834
02:16:41.281 --> 02:16:41.620
<v Speaker 2>ignite currency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with old glory now without glory,</v>

2835
02:16:41.621 --> 02:16:46.621
<v Speaker 2>not with the fucking money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess what I'm saying is like if </v>

2836
02:16:46.621 --> 02:16:49.830
<v Speaker 2>there is something positive about and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mobs of people doing this or that or</v>

2837
02:16:49.831 --> 02:16:53.250
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hyper outrage almost as though we're</v>

2838
02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:57.380
<v Speaker 2>looking at an immune response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's kind of going over board.</v>

2839
02:16:57.490 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2840
02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.760
<v Speaker 2>But if there's something positive in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that it seems that huge swaths of </v>

2841
02:17:04.301 --> 02:17:09.301
<v Speaker 2>people are becoming familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinations of the American empire and </v>

2842
02:17:10.691 --> 02:17:13.750
<v Speaker 2>understanding that here's how it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>working right now.</v>

2843
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.130
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2844
02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:20.740
<v Speaker 1>well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this illusion that it worked far </v>

2845
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:22.300
<v Speaker 1>differently when Obama was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2846
02:17:22.430 --> 02:17:27.430
<v Speaker 1>have you seen that video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Obama was running for president and </v>

2847
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:31.361
<v Speaker 1>he started talking about how to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with immigration and the immigration </v>

2848
02:17:31.361 --> 02:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's disturbing video because it's a</v>

2849
02:17:33.291 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 1>republican viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the way he's talking about it,</v>

2850

<v Speaker 1>conservative position now.</v>

2851
02:17:40.350 --> 02:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this democratic socialist </v>

2890
02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:26.761
<v Speaker 2>American president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to be very careful these </v>

2891
02:19:26.761 --> 02:19:26.761
<v Speaker 2>days because if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lips aren't tracking.</v>

2892
02:19:26.761 --> 02:19:26.890

<v Speaker 4>someone would know if that was a real </v>

2900
02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.771
<v Speaker 4>cspan thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we need to better secure the </v>

2901
02:19:44.771 --> 02:19:48.650
<v Speaker 4>border and a punish employers choose to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hire illegal immigrants.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying this because I'm shocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>that yeah,</v>

2903
02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:53.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's just off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same words.</v>

2904

<v Speaker 4>They all agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying the same words.</v>

2905
02:19:56.170 --> 02:19:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Can we find a version of it where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do that?</v>

2906
02:19:58.540 --> 02:19:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fishy,</v>

2911
02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.800
<v Speaker 4>but you can just look up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did Obama deported more people than </v>

<v Speaker 4>those looking at it</v>

2913
02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:17.870
<v Speaker 8>before you asked me to fund the video </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I'm finding various problems in </v>

2914

2916
02:20:24.111 --> 02:20:26.901
<v Speaker 8>instead of being true or false because </v>
<v Speaker 8>the definition of a deportation was </v>

2917
02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:28.200
<v Speaker 8>changed at some point in the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 8>of years.</v>

2918
02:20:28.201 --> 02:20:28.410

2951
02:21:51.081 --> 02:21:53.640
<v Speaker 4>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing for you if you watch </v>

2952

<v Speaker 4>like there's a million things to watch </v>

2953
02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:56.091
<v Speaker 4>and to watch people put words in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>

2954
02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:56.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to keep moving,</v>

<v Speaker 4>keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Dude,</v>

2956
02:21:57.301 --> 02:22:02.301
<v Speaker 4>let's get back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like this topic here that we're </v>

2957
02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:02.710
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like this.</v>

2958
02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:05.670
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an imbalance here.</v>

2959
02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:10.760
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely an imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that imbalance is being exposed </v>

2960
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:15.141
<v Speaker 4>by peoples' real opinion and this is one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the reasons why actual education and </v>

2961
02:22:15.141 --> 02:22:19.340
<v Speaker 4>actual like raising of human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be in critically,</v>

2962
02:22:19.410 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 4>critically important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas we ignored it as being not for </v>

2963
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2964
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:26.460
<v Speaker 4>it's way more important now because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community</v>

2965
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:31.460
<v Speaker 5>has gotten closer than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The community of humans and by not </v>

2966
02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:35.121
<v Speaker 5>respecting this community and not really</v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrating on the way people behave </v>

2967
02:22:36.301 --> 02:22:41.301
<v Speaker 5>and think rather than what they own or </v>
<v Speaker 5>what their job title is or what degree </v>

2968
02:22:41.521 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 5>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of concentrating on the.</v>

2969
02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:49.160
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that's most important </v>
<v Speaker 5>for us is the way we interact with each </v>

2970
02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:49.160
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2971
02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:49.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2972
02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:53.940
<v Speaker 5>we have created this issue where now </v>
<v Speaker 5>that everyone has a word in,</v>

2973
02:22:54.330 --> 02:22:57.390
<v Speaker 5>you've got all these broken people chime</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2974
02:22:57.391 --> 02:23:02.391
<v Speaker 5>in throwing an insult bombs and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime a woman is in the news who does </v>

2975
02:23:02.671 --> 02:23:07.671
<v Speaker 5>something remotely questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the color of brigade comes out in full </v>

2976
02:23:08.281 --> 02:23:13.281
<v Speaker 5>force on twitter and it's all these fake</v>
<v Speaker 5>accounts and eggs and some people in </v>

2977
02:23:13.281 --> 02:23:15.690
<v Speaker 5>real accounts and just want attention </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they just attack.</v>

2978
02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:16.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just a,</v>

2979
02:23:16.841 --> 02:23:18.930
<v Speaker 5>this is a real thing and it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

2980
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.120
<v Speaker 5>but they do it to men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to women.</v>

2981
02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 5>It always takes on a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>viable,</v>

2982
02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:28.940
<v Speaker 5>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like finally I get to say this </v>

2983
02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:28.940
<v Speaker 5>thing and what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2984
02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:28.940
<v Speaker 5>what has happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2985
02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:29.880
<v Speaker 5>somebody's got raised badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody,</v>

2986
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:34.910
<v Speaker 5>somebody did a terrible job raising a </v>
<v Speaker 5>man that got them to this position with </v>

2987
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:38.490
<v Speaker 5>this broken bundle of emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories and they're all fucked up with </v>

2988
02:23:38.490 --> 02:23:42.801
<v Speaker 5>no self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they find some little target </v>

2989
02:23:42.801 --> 02:23:42.801
<v Speaker 5>online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is,</v>

2990
02:23:42.801 --> 02:23:43.440
<v Speaker 5>fuck you Duncan Trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking sell out,</v>

2991

<v Speaker 5>And next thing you know,</v>

2992
02:23:45.090 --> 02:23:50.090
<v Speaker 5>they're attacking you and you might just</v>
<v Speaker 5>be about to go to the movies with your </v>

2993
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.090
<v Speaker 5>wife and you read that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2994
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:51.000
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this guy's problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2995
02:23:51.001 --> 02:23:56.001
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put your phone down and you go into </v>

2996
02:23:56.001 --> 02:23:56.490
<v Speaker 5>that theater and you're all pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 5>and fucking tweet him back,</v>

2997
02:23:56.850 --> 02:23:58.510
<v Speaker 5>but you should this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

2998
02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.250
<v Speaker 5>There's too many people.</v>

2999
02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:00.480
<v Speaker 5>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Too many people.</v>

3000
02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.840
<v Speaker 5>The bad thing is you're going to miss a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of good people,</v>

3001
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.050
<v Speaker 5>but the good thing is you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>put a lot out.</v>

3002
02:24:07.410 --> 02:24:07.820
<v Speaker 5>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Go.</v>

3003
02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:12.860
<v Speaker 5>You have to put a lot of good out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't dwell too much in the </v>

3004
02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:12.860
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get through this.</v>

3005
02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.260
<v Speaker 5>This is a tumultuous adolescent stage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>human interaction.</v>

3006
02:24:16.261 --> 02:24:16.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

3007
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:21.950
<v Speaker 5>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get through this and </v>

3008
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:23.781
<v Speaker 5>reach a much higher level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding of each other in a higher </v>

3009
02:24:23.781 --> 02:24:27.741
<v Speaker 5>level of understanding of community and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why all these school shootings </v>

3010
02:24:27.741 --> 02:24:31.911
<v Speaker 5>are happening and all this chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people driving trucks into crowds and </v>

3011
02:24:31.911 --> 02:24:36.141
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because people are feeling out of </v>

3012
02:24:36.141 --> 02:24:36.141
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3013
02:24:36.141 --> 02:24:37.500
<v Speaker 5>this project of civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

3014
02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.680
<v Speaker 5>They feel horribly suicidal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed and confused and hateful and </v>

3015
02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:47.331
<v Speaker 5>angry and they're filled up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals and pharmaceuticals and </v>

3016
02:24:47.331 --> 02:24:51.261
<v Speaker 5>loneliness and despair and anger and </v>
<v Speaker 5>resentment and religious fervor and </v>

3017
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:56.730
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck else is pushing them </v>
<v Speaker 5>through this life and then they react.</v>

3018
02:24:56.730 --> 02:24:59.910
<v Speaker 5>They explode and this more explode all </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the place,</v>

3019
02:24:59.911 --> 02:25:01.920
<v Speaker 5>but we got to take away the tools of </v>
<v Speaker 5>explosion.</v>

3020
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.000
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to figure out why people are </v>

3021
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.841
<v Speaker 5>exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come no one is concentrating on why </v>

3022
02:25:08.841 --> 02:25:10.480
<v Speaker 5>people were exposed was exploding every </v>
<v Speaker 5>once the women want to go,</v>

3023
02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:12.780
<v Speaker 5>it's toxic masculinity and the men want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go.</v>

3024
02:25:12.781 --> 02:25:17.781
<v Speaker 5>We're raising pussies and nobody wants </v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure out what the fuck it is and </v>

3025
02:25:17.781 --> 02:25:19.780
<v Speaker 5>they just hope that it doesn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>again and then it happens again.</v>

3026
02:25:19.781 --> 02:25:24.781
<v Speaker 5>In the argument starts up and Ted nugent</v>
<v Speaker 5>calls everybody at coc and the fucking </v>

3027
02:25:24.781 --> 02:25:29.490
<v Speaker 5>people that want to guns taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all fucking storm in and they </v>

3028
02:25:29.490 --> 02:25:33.700
<v Speaker 5>demand and they ended the streak in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of the senator's house at 2:00</v>

3029
02:25:33.701 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brigade roles in copper grade rolls in.</v>

3030
02:25:37.271 --> 02:25:39.480
<v Speaker 5>They started tweeting up a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3031
02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

3032
02:25:40.361 --> 02:25:45.361
<v Speaker 5>this is where we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we're not examining the behavior </v>

3033
02:25:45.361 --> 02:25:46.030
<v Speaker 5>and the development of the human being.</v>

3034
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:51.030
<v Speaker 5>It's a nonissue in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the most important things </v>

3035
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:54.091
<v Speaker 5>about being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to wait till you get to be 30 </v>

3036
02:25:54.091 --> 02:25:54.091
<v Speaker 5>and he'd take a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An Anthony Robbins seminar.</v>

3037
02:25:54.091 --> 02:25:58.691
<v Speaker 5>I try to get your shit together with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some Voodoo preacher down in Malibu </v>

3038
02:25:58.691 --> 02:26:02.341
<v Speaker 5>that's doing some rock and roll church </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian thing and all the cool people </v>

3039
02:26:02.341 --> 02:26:02.450
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Jeez.</v>

3040
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:05.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3041
02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:10.470
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy plays piano and he fucks </v>

3042
02:26:10.470 --> 02:26:10.470
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can.</v>

3043
02:26:10.470 --> 02:26:10.540
<v Speaker 5>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where we are.</v>

3044
02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:15.640
<v Speaker 5>This is where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're this tumultuous stage where all </v>

3045
02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.051
<v Speaker 5>this information's flowing around and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to come up with management skills </v>

3046
02:26:19.051 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 5>management skills for behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 5>communication.</v>

3047
02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:26.740
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we have to recognize that we're all </v>

3048
02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:26.740
<v Speaker 6>in this together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

3049
02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:28.770
<v Speaker 6>I love that description is such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>perfect description and I think that's,</v>

3050
02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:29.460
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3051
02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:33.510
<v Speaker 6>that's the main thing for everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 6>freaked out to remind themselves stuff.</v>

3052
02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:34.310
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3053
02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.780
<v Speaker 6>of course you're freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course you should be the right way to</v>

3054
02:26:38.781 --> 02:26:40.690
<v Speaker 6>feel in a snow storm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

3055
02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:43.340
<v Speaker 6>you're going to feel like I can't quite </v>
<v Speaker 6>see what's up.</v>

3056
02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:46.880
<v Speaker 6>So like definitely I have to be more </v>
<v Speaker 6>compassionate when I,</v>

3057
02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 6>when I see people are super freaking out</v>
<v Speaker 6>because sometimes I judge them and then </v>

3058
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.020
<v Speaker 6>they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all have to be more compassionate to </v>

3059
02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:56.020
<v Speaker 6>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then,</v>

3060
02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:00.131
<v Speaker 6>so if this is the state of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about management skills,</v>

3061
02:27:00.741 --> 02:27:03.020
<v Speaker 6>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a thing.</v>

3062
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:08.770
<v Speaker 6>This Guy Jack Kornfield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who I have in my podcast sometimes </v>

3063
02:27:08.770 --> 02:27:08.770
<v Speaker 6>taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy's an he's amazing.</v>

3064
02:27:08.770 --> 02:27:13.660
<v Speaker 6>He's a Buddhist teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he says tend to the part of the </v>

3065
02:27:14.221 --> 02:27:16.380
<v Speaker 6>garden that you can touch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3066
02:27:16.890 --> 02:27:21.110
<v Speaker 6>And I think that is such incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>incredible instructors agree with.</v>

3067
02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.200
<v Speaker 6>Put it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3068
02:27:22.201 --> 02:27:23.300
<v Speaker 6>that's a great way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3069
02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:24.020
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's,</v>

3070
02:27:24.021 --> 02:27:29.021
<v Speaker 6>it's like in all that chaos that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>just described where like you see the </v>

3071
02:27:29.021 --> 02:27:31.230
<v Speaker 6>thing and you realize like whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 6>may be,</v>

3072
02:27:31.231 --> 02:27:33.270
<v Speaker 6>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the school shooting,</v>

3073
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:35.760
<v Speaker 6>the immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bus,</v>

3074
02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:37.820
<v Speaker 6>that whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you really,</v>

3075
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.770
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3076
02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:43.680
<v Speaker 6>you get this in sad feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing I can do about that.</v>

3077
02:27:43.681 --> 02:27:46.920
<v Speaker 6>And so you end up online,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're scared.</v>

3078
02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:50.580
<v Speaker 6>Fear in Buddhism is cold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anger.</v>

3079
02:27:50.610 --> 02:27:53.190
<v Speaker 6>Like when fear gets hot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it turns into anger.</v>

3080
02:27:53.191 --> 02:27:58.191
<v Speaker 6>So you're going to turn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be angry because you're </v>

3081
02:27:58.191 --> 02:28:01.041
<v Speaker 6>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you start firing these shots </v>

3082
02:28:01.041 --> 02:28:02.550
<v Speaker 6>online in the entire time you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3083
02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:07.830
<v Speaker 6>the entire time you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your mother who lives at the other,</v>

3084
02:28:07.831 --> 02:28:12.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere in the middle of the country </v>

3085
02:28:12.831 --> 02:28:15.410
<v Speaker 6>is living by herself in a house where </v>
<v Speaker 6>she doesn't have enough money and the </v>

3086
02:28:15.901 --> 02:28:19.590
<v Speaker 6>house is dilapidated and you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 6>been paying attention to her.</v>

3087
02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.890
<v Speaker 6>She needs your fucking help,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3088
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:27.130
<v Speaker 6>It's not time for you necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even though your aspiration to rebalance</v>

3089
02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 6>a democracy is beautiful and we all want</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3090
02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.210
<v Speaker 6>You're fucking neglecting one of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>best friends,</v>

3091
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:40.220
<v Speaker 6>not your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3092
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:45.230
<v Speaker 6>So someone you know is exhibiting like </v>
<v Speaker 6>some fucking behaviors that are like </v>

3093
02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:49.070
<v Speaker 6>awful little bit or like somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your neighborhood or you know,</v>

3094
02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.450
<v Speaker 6>so it's like the whole time your mind </v>
<v Speaker 6>through anger is focusing on the fucking</v>

3095
02:28:53.451 --> 02:28:56.630
<v Speaker 6>press secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

3097
02:28:58.250 --> 02:29:01.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't think the press secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could be totally off on this,</v>

3098
02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:05.870
<v Speaker 6>but you want to talk about shooting the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking messenger man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You perfect day when she's the </v>

3100
02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Messenger.</v>

<v Speaker 6>that woman like that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Does she have the most pleasing </v>

3104
02:29:23.711 --> 02:29:26.120
<v Speaker 6>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you agree with her politics?</v>

3105
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:27.830
<v Speaker 6>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

3107
02:29:30.151 --> 02:29:30.640

3108
02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:32.500
<v Speaker 1>if she didn't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

3109
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if she was cheerful and she went</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there and Jim Costa was fucking </v>

3110
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:38.410
<v Speaker 1>screaming at her that his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acosta,</v>

3111
02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:43.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that guy gets heckled everywhere he </v>

3112
02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:45.641
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they put signs up behind him and </v>

3113
02:29:45.641 --> 02:29:45.641
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN sucks.</v>

3114
02:29:45.641 --> 02:29:47.350
<v Speaker 1>There's some really fun things about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump administration,</v>

3115
02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:52.500
<v Speaker 1>some really fun things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the fun things is these </v>

3116
02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:52.810
<v Speaker 1>people that are journalists that takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves super serious,</v>

3117
02:29:52.890 --> 02:29:55.420
<v Speaker 1>are they getting shit on for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

3118
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting.</v>

3119
02:29:57.310 --> 02:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>They're getting called out for some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ridiculous behavior,</v>

3120
02:30:00.581 --> 02:30:03.340
<v Speaker 1>like yelling out questions during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press conference,</v>

3121
02:30:03.341 --> 02:30:08.341
<v Speaker 1>like your questions more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people around you that might be </v>

3122
02:30:08.341 --> 02:30:11.311
<v Speaker 1>politely raising their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've decided you need the world needs </v>

3123
02:30:11.311 --> 02:30:12.880
<v Speaker 1>to know the world needs to know and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to hold these people,</v>

3124
02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:14.020
<v Speaker 1>hold their feet to the fire.</v>

3125
02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3126
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is not the way to communicate</v>

3127
02:30:17.891 --> 02:30:22.891
<v Speaker 1>with people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this maxine waters idea of like </v>

3128
02:30:22.891 --> 02:30:26.070
<v Speaker 1>getting people to protest people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and build a crowd and let </v>

3129
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:27.070
<v Speaker 1>them know that they're not welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3130
02:30:27.071 --> 02:30:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3131
02:30:29.411 --> 02:30:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Let's just play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at all these people </v>

3132
02:30:34.411 --> 02:30:34.960
<v Speaker 1>that are imposing these immoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

3133
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:38.410
<v Speaker 1>separating children from their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be the most egregious.</v>

3134
02:30:38.411 --> 02:30:40.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that bothers us the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

3135
02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's most horrific.</v>

3136
02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:45.520
<v Speaker 1>So how Amia bombing them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3137
02:30:45.521 --> 02:30:46.160
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3138
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.130
<v Speaker 1>we know that that's far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not here,</v>

3139
02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but how do you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just let it happen?</v>

3140
02:30:51.161 --> 02:30:56.161
<v Speaker 1>These smiling demons just pass these </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws and laugh in your face and there's </v>

3141
02:30:56.161 --> 02:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>no push back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>

3142
02:30:57.011 --> 02:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So what's the pushback?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get push back?</v>

3143
02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:03.130
<v Speaker 1>This is where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have a point.</v>

3144
02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with something that's </v>

3145
02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>that disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's no actual violence.</v>

3146
02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so heinous,</v>

3147
02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you're separating poor people from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

3160
02:31:40.351 --> 02:31:42.450
<v Speaker 5>law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people's lives are going to get</v>

<v Speaker 5>ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many thousands of kids are going to </v>

3162
02:31:47.451 --> 02:31:49.820
<v Speaker 5>get traumatically separated from their </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents and develop to become a more </v>

3163
02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:53.241
<v Speaker 5>fucked up person who truly resents and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hates the United States and get </v>

3166
02:31:54.990 --> 02:31:57.720
<v Speaker 5>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it already happened.</v>

3167
02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:02.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not surprised on you want to know </v>

3168
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:02.960
<v Speaker 5>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that,</v>

3169
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:03.960
<v Speaker 5>but how would you stop that?</v>

3170
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how you would stop that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the only ways that I could </v>

3171
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:12.441
<v Speaker 5>think of being really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really effective in getting a message </v>

3172
02:32:13.711 --> 02:32:18.711
<v Speaker 5>across is to make it super uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people that push that message </v>

3173
02:32:18.711 --> 02:32:19.080
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3174
02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:22.830
<v Speaker 5>What people that support that policy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that think it's not a big deal.</v>

3175
02:32:22.831 --> 02:32:27.831
<v Speaker 5>Cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeff sessions gave a speech where they </v>

3176
02:32:27.831 --> 02:32:31.260
<v Speaker 5>made a joke about separating kids from </v>
<v Speaker 5>their families and the audience laughed.</v>

3177
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Pull that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull that up.</v>

3178
02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:37.400
<v Speaker 5>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was on the cover of every new source </v>

3179
02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:37.400
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

3180
02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:39.330
<v Speaker 5>Fucking sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this poor little fuck,</v>

3181
02:32:39.810 --> 02:32:42.170
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy,</v>

3182
02:32:42.450 --> 02:32:46.620
<v Speaker 5>he just stopped evolving and he got into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this and he's not getting information.</v>

3183
02:32:46.650 --> 02:32:47.880
<v Speaker 5>He's not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>

3184
02:32:47.881 --> 02:32:50.250
<v Speaker 5>He's not interacting with people who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not evolving his ideas.</v>

3185
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:55.670
<v Speaker 5>He stuck on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People who smoke marijuana are bad </v>

3186
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:58.260
<v Speaker 5>people face some 1930 shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he's a moron.</v>

3187
02:32:58.470 --> 02:32:59.670
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of ways,</v>

3188
02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 5>and this is the product of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

3189
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:05.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a product of his interactions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ecosystem and that he exists in.</v>

3190
02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:10.580
<v Speaker 5>He exists in this bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeff sessions speaking out about </v>

3191
02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:10.650
<v Speaker 5>separating families</v>

3192
02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:15.760
<v Speaker 9>from the other side on this issue as on </v>
<v Speaker 9>many others has become radicalized.</v>

3193
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:21.670
<v Speaker 9>We hear views on television today that </v>
<v Speaker 9>are on the lunatic fringe frankly,</v>

3194
02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:26.570
<v Speaker 9>and what is perhaps more galling is the </v>
<v Speaker 9>epoch hypocrisy.</v>

3195
02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:29.360
<v Speaker 9>These same people live in gated </v>
<v Speaker 9>communities,</v>

3196
02:33:29.361 --> 02:33:34.361
<v Speaker 9>many of them and our featured at events </v>
<v Speaker 9>where you have to have an id to even </v>

3197
02:33:34.911 --> 02:33:39.911
<v Speaker 9>come in and hear him speak.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I liked the little security around them </v>

3198
02:33:39.911 --> 02:33:41.600
<v Speaker 9>ourselves and if you try to scale the </v>
<v Speaker 9>fence of,</v>

3199
02:33:41.601 --> 02:33:46.601
<v Speaker 9>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they'll be even too happy to have you </v>

3200
02:33:46.601 --> 02:33:49.160
<v Speaker 9>arrested and separated from your </v>
<v Speaker 9>children.</v>

3201
02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.990
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like that joke was actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>written for him,</v>

3202
02:33:51.991 --> 02:33:56.991
<v Speaker 5>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Says the fucking guy getting people </v>

3203
02:33:56.991 --> 02:33:57.540
<v Speaker 5>arrested for marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What aloone?</v>

3204
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3205
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.730
<v Speaker 5>obviously fucking dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a big difference between someone</v>

3206
02:34:02.731 --> 02:34:05.460
<v Speaker 5>breaking into your house and break it </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the country to try to get a job.</v>

3207
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:08.400
<v Speaker 5>You're not saying that people should </v>
<v Speaker 5>break into people's houses.</v>

3208
02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:13.760
<v Speaker 5>The main thing is jeff sessions is it </v>
<v Speaker 5>represents something in the world and </v>

3209
02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:18.340
<v Speaker 5>what that thing is is a force that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actively</v>

3210
02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:23.340
<v Speaker 6>trying to reduce love in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's fucking rail and so that's the.</v>

3211
02:34:26.231 --> 02:34:30.880
<v Speaker 6>If you want to come up with a nice war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a name for what's happening.</v>

3212
02:34:30.881 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 6>This revolution that's happening and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

3213
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:35.950
<v Speaker 6>is we're pushing back against that.</v>

3214
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.560
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I be the devil's advocate?</v>

3215
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I'll be the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3216
02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:39.960
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what he's doing.</v>

3217
02:34:40.410 --> 02:34:45.410
<v Speaker 5>He's supporting the law that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>law and this is how we keep a beautiful </v>

3218
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:48.921
<v Speaker 5>country like America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason why we have nice clean </v>

3219
02:34:48.921 --> 02:34:51.111
<v Speaker 5>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason why I have cops social </v>

3220
02:34:51.111 --> 02:34:53.451
<v Speaker 5>security and it's because we have rules </v>
<v Speaker 5>and as soon as we just allow people to </v>

3221
02:34:53.451 --> 02:34:57.621
<v Speaker 5>bypass those rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that don't agree with our way of </v>

3222
02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:57.621
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't they?</v>

3223
02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:57.750
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't support our way of life.</v>

3224
02:34:57.930 --> 02:35:00.990
<v Speaker 5>They just want to come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mooch off the system.</v>

3225
02:35:01.170 --> 02:35:03.300
<v Speaker 5>That's harder for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's harder for him.</v>

3226
02:35:03.301 --> 02:35:08.301
<v Speaker 5>It's harder for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All Johnny tax payer out there has to </v>

3227
02:35:08.301 --> 02:35:09.510
<v Speaker 5>pay for these migrants so you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

3228
02:35:09.511 --> 02:35:13.650
<v Speaker 5>They're not even a part of your clan </v>
<v Speaker 5>from another close by Cloud Jeff.</v>

3229
02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:16.630
<v Speaker 5>But here's the bigger problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the big problem in.</v>

3230
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:17.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3231
02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:21.350
<v Speaker 6>and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything you just said,</v>

3232
02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:26.000
<v Speaker 6>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>sessions too legit to quit.</v>

3233
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:29.310
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as like the rules of the game and</v>

3234
02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.600
<v Speaker 6>in some ways I guess it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like if we look at it from a bigger </v>

3235
02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.651
<v Speaker 6>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you type really doesn't like at </v>

3236
02:35:38.651 --> 02:35:42.131
<v Speaker 6>all for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe it's just because you're old </v>

3237
02:35:42.131 --> 02:35:44.810
<v Speaker 6>and your body probably hurts a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit and also that fucking butt plug that</v>

3238
02:35:44.811 --> 02:35:49.811
<v Speaker 6>I would bet $200,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you have shoved into your asshole </v>

3239
02:35:49.811 --> 02:35:51.320
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think I think all the fucking time and I</v>

3240
02:35:51.321 --> 02:35:52.860
<v Speaker 6>think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I,</v>

3241
02:35:52.861 --> 02:35:56.380
<v Speaker 6>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get a big bdsm vibe from that dude,</v>

3242
02:35:56.381 --> 02:35:58.100
<v Speaker 6>but that's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's true.</v>

3243
02:35:58.101 --> 02:35:59.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's my point,</v>

3244
02:35:59.601 --> 02:36:01.250
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3245
02:36:01.350 --> 02:36:04.420
<v Speaker 6>there's a bigger thing happening and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that bigger thing is,</v>

3246
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:05.860
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is just,</v>

3247
02:36:05.930 --> 02:36:10.930
<v Speaker 6>it's for a lot of people it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>unpalatable because it's so complex and </v>

3248
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:15.071
<v Speaker 6>we don't yet know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we live on a planet and you say this</v>

3249
02:36:16.821 --> 02:36:19.700
<v Speaker 6>all the time where we are all people.</v>

3250
02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:23.360
<v Speaker 6>We are planetariums,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are earthlings,</v>

3251
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:28.510
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We happen to have been born into a </v>

3252
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:29.360
<v Speaker 6>country this country or that country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of these countries have big fucking</v>

3253
02:36:29.361 --> 02:36:34.361
<v Speaker 6>walls around them because there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>prosperity inside that country and </v>

3254
02:36:34.361 --> 02:36:37.841
<v Speaker 6>there's prosperity inside that country </v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's not prosperity and other </v>

3255
02:36:37.841 --> 02:36:39.800
<v Speaker 6>places and people are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're suffering bad,</v>

3256
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:41.090
<v Speaker 6>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bad,</v>

3257
02:36:41.091 --> 02:36:44.480
<v Speaker 6>bad suffering where it's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's like they can't.</v>

3258
02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:47.420
<v Speaker 6>They can't live in some of these places </v>
<v Speaker 6>without getting killed,</v>

3259
02:36:47.421 --> 02:36:52.421
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The chance of them getting killed as </v>

3260
02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:54.520
<v Speaker 6>high for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're just doing what any living </v>

3261
02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.550
<v Speaker 6>organism does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to get to a better spot.</v>

3262
02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:57.530
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mr sessions,</v>

3263
02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:01.310
<v Speaker 6>you probably don't believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but once those fucking ice caps melt,</v>

3264
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:06.670
<v Speaker 6>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When the cities in the next 50 years or </v>

3265
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:10.661
<v Speaker 6>so become inundated with water and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people have to start moving more and </v>

3266
02:37:10.661 --> 02:37:12.710
<v Speaker 6>more and more from places that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>becoming uninhabitable.</v>

3267
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:14.690
<v Speaker 6>What do you think that's gonna Happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know man,</v>

3268
02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:16.400
<v Speaker 6>but let's say it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's put.</v>

3269
02:37:16.410 --> 02:37:18.710
<v Speaker 6>Let's make a long date.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what do we do Duncan?</v>

3270
02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:20.420
<v Speaker 6>We just open up the borders for </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody.</v>

3271
02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:21.590
<v Speaker 6>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sessions,</v>

3272
02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:25.160
<v Speaker 6>I don't fucking know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can tell you this.</v>

3273
02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:28.940
<v Speaker 6>If we start approaching this from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>perspective of love,</v>

3274
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:34.210
<v Speaker 6>which is the perspective of like we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't need to separate them from their </v>

3275
02:37:34.210 --> 02:37:35.180
<v Speaker 6>kids and there might be a way to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

3276
02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:37.610
<v Speaker 6>That eases their suffering a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 6>more.</v>

3277
02:37:37.611 --> 02:37:39.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but my.</v>

3278
02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.440
<v Speaker 6>From looking at what you're doing right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now that a net and I think we can do it </v>

3279
02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:45.440
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is,</v>

3280
02:37:45.441 --> 02:37:50.441
<v Speaker 6>but I think if we get a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>together and really think about it and </v>

3281
02:37:50.441 --> 02:37:52.730
<v Speaker 6>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not talking redistribution of wealth</v>

3282
02:37:52.731 --> 02:37:57.731
<v Speaker 6>or some kind of crazy communist shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying I know for sure we can </v>

3283
02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:02.750
<v Speaker 6>do better than those God damn aluminum </v>
<v Speaker 6>blankets you're putting on those fucking</v>

3284
02:38:02.751 --> 02:38:04.940
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can we get a guitar player in here?</v>

3285
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:06.950
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe we can get some beds in here.</v>

3286
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:08.330
<v Speaker 6>Is there a way to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3287
02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:10.160
<v Speaker 6>there's just all kinds of shit we could </v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

3288
02:38:10.161 --> 02:38:12.170
<v Speaker 6>I think that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What am I going to do?</v>

3289
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Why would that help though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the people are still gonna come </v>

3290
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.230
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be in prison.</v>

3291
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>So you play the guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

3292
02:38:18.130 --> 02:38:23.130
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying play the guitar to solve </v>

3293
02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:24.851
<v Speaker 6>the immigration problem that worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure the immigration problem would </v>

3294
02:38:24.851 --> 02:38:28.181
<v Speaker 6>be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that the current </v>

3295
02:38:28.181 --> 02:38:29.420
<v Speaker 6>methodology seems to be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 6>sadistic than it needs to be.</v>

3296
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 6>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the answer.</v>

3297
02:38:31.611 --> 02:38:36.611
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I do know we're converging as a </v>

3298
02:38:36.611 --> 02:38:39.611
<v Speaker 6>species and I would imagine that as </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology continues to connect us,</v>

3299
02:38:41.091 --> 02:38:44.090
<v Speaker 6>we're going to be transcending </v>
<v Speaker 6>nationalities in a way that aren't going</v>

3300
02:38:44.091 --> 02:38:46.760
<v Speaker 6>to be palatable to people like jeff </v>
<v Speaker 6>sessions.</v>

3301
02:38:46.761 --> 02:38:48.680
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3302
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:50.870
<v Speaker 6>that's what's happened.</v>

3303
02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:52.940
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you like?</v>

3304
02:38:52.941 --> 02:38:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3305
02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not jeff sessions anymore on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3306
02:38:56.361 --> 02:38:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey dog again.</v>

3307
02:38:58.850 --> 02:38:59.510

3308
02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:00.740
<v Speaker 6>well for?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3309
02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:04.000
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you my response to that,</v>

3310
02:39:04.001 --> 02:39:05.740
<v Speaker 6>which isn't going to be right because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't really.</v>

3311
02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand the issue at a level </v>
<v Speaker 6>deep enough.</v>

3312
02:39:08.921 --> 02:39:11.230
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So can I just say like one,</v>

3313
02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:13.400
<v Speaker 6>there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3314
02:39:13.570 --> 02:39:16.780
<v Speaker 6>it's a complex situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's not one answer to it,</v>

3315
02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:21.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just let anybody in who's not a </v>

3316
02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:21.780
<v Speaker 1>criminal,</v>

3317
02:39:22.580 --> 02:39:25.040
<v Speaker 6>so how do we did it's hard to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do we detect that?</v>

3318
02:39:25.041 --> 02:39:25.280
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3319
02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:30.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to have some sort of faith in </v>

3320
02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:30.400
<v Speaker 1>their records so we would have to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>their record keeping.</v>

3321
02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:34.851
<v Speaker 1>So really what we want to really the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it correctly is first of all,</v>

3322
02:39:35.541 --> 02:39:37.970
<v Speaker 1>anyone is attached to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Mexico or Canada,</v>

3323
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:43.030
<v Speaker 1>make sure they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that they are viable and </v>

3324
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:44.450
<v Speaker 1>stable and help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real thing.</v>

3325
02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Treat them as if they're a colony of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

3326
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.820
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that they're not sovereign,</v>

3327
02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that there's still Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like treat them like they are </v>

3328
02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:57.851
<v Speaker 1>connected to us and we don't want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fucked up and crazy set of </v>

3329
02:39:57.851 --> 02:40:01.511
<v Speaker 1>building up a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it so that nobody wants to come </v>

3330
02:40:01.511 --> 02:40:01.511
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3331
02:40:01.511 --> 02:40:02.090
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the prosperity way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go about it.</v>

3332
02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3333
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's fucking beautiful.</v>

3334
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:11.650
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why people vacation in </v>

3335
02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

3336
02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Poland,</v>

3337
02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Mita</v>

3338
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:19.070
<v Speaker 5>or a fucking Puerto Vallarta or cabo or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:23.190
<v Speaker 5>to loom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's it's fucking beautiful.</v>

3340
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:28.460
<v Speaker 5>The idea that it's beautiful and also </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous and scary and filled with </v>

3341
02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:29.190
<v Speaker 5>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking stupid.</v>

3342
02:40:29.610 --> 02:40:30.360
<v Speaker 5>So then you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3343
02:40:30.361 --> 02:40:32.460
<v Speaker 5>what's the problem here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the problem here is drugs.</v>

3344
02:40:32.461 --> 02:40:36.040
<v Speaker 5>Illegal drugs are illegal in the United </v>
<v Speaker 5>States wants to buy a bunch of drugs.</v>

3345
02:40:36.041 --> 02:40:37.980
<v Speaker 5>So all these people making billions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars selling drugs,</v>

3346
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:39.990
<v Speaker 5>there's only one way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to kill cops.</v>

3347
02:40:40.170 --> 02:40:41.940
<v Speaker 5>You got to kill cops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill rats.</v>

3348
02:40:41.941 --> 02:40:46.941
<v Speaker 5>You gotta kill rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to kill whoever the fuck you </v>

3349
02:40:46.941 --> 02:40:46.941
<v Speaker 5>gotta kill and you've got to send a </v>
<v Speaker 5>message.</v>

3350
02:40:46.941 --> 02:40:49.260
<v Speaker 5>You've got to hang people from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>bridges and shit.</v>

3351
02:40:49.261 --> 02:40:54.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to do things to send a message </v>

3352
02:40:54.261 --> 02:40:54.900
<v Speaker 5>that you're ruthless and you're here to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get that money and there's a lot of that</v>

3353
02:40:54.901 --> 02:40:58.950
<v Speaker 5>going on and that is no different than </v>
<v Speaker 5>Al Capone during the fucking prohibition</v>

3354
02:40:58.951 --> 02:41:01.080
<v Speaker 5>of alcohol in the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

3355
02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:06.240
<v Speaker 5>It's the same God damned thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You make something illegal that </v>

3356
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:06.660
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants and only criminals are </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to sell it and boom,</v>

3357
02:41:06.661 --> 02:41:09.630
<v Speaker 5>you got a thriving criminal economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

3358
02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:14.660
<v Speaker 5>And so we're stuck next to a thriving </v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal economy with no management of </v>

3359
02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:15.240
<v Speaker 5>it whatsoever other than bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3360
02:41:15.241 --> 02:41:20.241
<v Speaker 5>So occasionally they throw some bullets </v>
<v Speaker 5>into these people and then they come </v>

3361
02:41:20.241 --> 02:41:22.821
<v Speaker 5>back stronger than ever because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>more drug money and there's less of </v>

3362
02:41:22.821 --> 02:41:25.731
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the one person gets stronger and El </v>

3363
02:41:25.731 --> 02:41:28.280
<v Speaker 5>Chapo digs a fucking hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mile through the ground and gets out </v>

3364
02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:28.280
<v Speaker 5>of jail again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is crazy,</v>

3365
02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:31.320
<v Speaker 5>but this is what we're next to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so instead of saying,</v>

3366
02:41:31.321 --> 02:41:36.321
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to make a fucking wall and make </v>

3367
02:41:36.321 --> 02:41:37.831
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we should be saying is what do we </v>

3368
02:41:37.831 --> 02:41:40.671
<v Speaker 5>have to do to not just fix Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just help them and come up with some</v>

3369
02:41:41.161 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 5>sort of strategy and a plan to build </v>
<v Speaker 5>them up almost as equals.</v>

3370
02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:46.920
<v Speaker 5>But we've got to fix our fucking poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods.</v>

3371
02:41:47.250 --> 02:41:52.250
<v Speaker 5>We've got to fix these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods that had been drenched in </v>

3372
02:41:52.250 --> 02:41:53.730
<v Speaker 5>poverty since 19 twice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about fix them?</v>

3373
02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Fix them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put some energy into it.</v>

3374
02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:57.900
<v Speaker 5>Put some planning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hire people the same way.</v>

3375
02:41:58.050 --> 02:42:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Halliburton hires people to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>rebuild shit.</v>

3376
02:42:00.451 --> 02:42:05.451
<v Speaker 5>We blow up in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should be hiring people to figure </v>

3377
02:42:05.451 --> 02:42:08.541
<v Speaker 5>out how to rebuild these communities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to give people jobs and </v>

3378
02:42:08.541 --> 02:42:11.580
<v Speaker 5>figuring out how to develop community </v>
<v Speaker 5>center so that kids have somewhere to go</v>

3379
02:42:11.581 --> 02:42:16.581
<v Speaker 5>there where they can learn and be </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive so you're developing less </v>

3380
02:42:16.581 --> 02:42:16.581
<v Speaker 5>losers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>giving people hopes and dreams,</v>

3381
02:42:16.581 --> 02:42:18.690
<v Speaker 5>giving them things that they can put </v>
<v Speaker 5>their energy to that make them feel good</v>

3382
02:42:18.691 --> 02:42:19.920
<v Speaker 5>about life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3383
02:42:19.921 --> 02:42:23.670
<v Speaker 5>give them skills and and games they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>play and things they could do where they</v>

3384
02:42:23.671 --> 02:42:25.590
<v Speaker 5>get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they develop self esteem,</v>

3385
02:42:25.591 --> 02:42:30.591
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the most terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about growing up in an impoverished </v>

3386
02:42:30.591 --> 02:42:31.440
<v Speaker 5>crime ridden gang infested neighborhood.</v>

3387
02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:33.660
<v Speaker 5>As you feel like you're nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are nothing.</v>

3388
02:42:33.661 --> 02:42:35.370
<v Speaker 5>Your life can be taken away at any </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

3389
02:42:35.371 --> 02:42:40.371
<v Speaker 5>You got to be careful where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's a fly and people getting </v>

3390
02:42:40.371 --> 02:42:40.380
<v Speaker 5>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are killing people over words and</v>

3391
02:42:40.381 --> 02:42:45.381
<v Speaker 5>insults and fucking territory for drugs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and your aunts on crack and your uncles </v>

3392
02:42:45.391 --> 02:42:49.740
<v Speaker 5>in jail and it's just seems like there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>no fucking hope and no one does anything</v>

3393
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:50.610
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one doesn't,</v>

3394
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:55.710
<v Speaker 5>but few people do things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people dedicate their lives to </v>

3395
02:42:55.710 --> 02:42:58.431
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not enough from a governmental </v>

3396
02:42:58.431 --> 02:42:58.431
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one in the top of the organization is</v>

3397
02:42:58.431 --> 02:43:00.510
<v Speaker 5>looking at this big thing and saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all going,</v>

3398
02:43:00.511 --> 02:43:01.860
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got to drill more oil.</v>

3399
02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:03.450
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to do with the resources,</v>

3400
02:43:03.451 --> 02:43:04.520
<v Speaker 5>the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason.</v>

3401
02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:07.890
<v Speaker 5>What about our greatest resource human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings?</v>

3402
02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 5>The greatest way to make America great </v>
<v Speaker 5>again is to have less losers.</v>

3403
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.280
<v Speaker 5>The way to have less losers is you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to find the spots that are sick and </v>

3404
02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:17.950
<v Speaker 5>healed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3405
02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:20.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find these communities that are,</v>

3406
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:25.230
<v Speaker 5>that have the momentum of poverty and </v>
<v Speaker 5>crime and violence and it's existed for </v>

3407
02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:28.390
<v Speaker 5>as long as we can think for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fix them,</v>

3408
02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:33.660
<v Speaker 5>fix them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and have a concerted effort to fix them </v>

3409
02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:35.090
<v Speaker 5>and do and bring everybody together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody together and instead of this,</v>

3410
02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:39.100
<v Speaker 5>this idea that we're all separate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just fucking to party,</v>

3411
02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:44.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Left nonsense is civil war to trump </v>

3412
02:43:44.130 --> 02:43:47.161
<v Speaker 5>supporters and and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people want to kick people out of </v>

3413
02:43:47.161 --> 02:43:49.531
<v Speaker 5>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about we all realized that if we're </v>

3414
02:43:49.531 --> 02:43:52.351
<v Speaker 5>going to treat each other as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to agree that we're on this </v>

3415
02:43:52.351 --> 02:43:52.810
<v Speaker 5>team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got to start acting like teammates.</v>

3416
02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:53.890
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3417
02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:55.660
<v Speaker 5>so you don't like what the coach is </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

3418
02:43:55.870 --> 02:44:00.870
<v Speaker 5>Let's let's find common ground instead </v>
<v Speaker 5>of always searching for the negative in </v>

3419
02:44:01.361 --> 02:44:06.361
<v Speaker 5>things instead of reinforcing ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas because you know that that's what </v>

3420
02:44:06.361 --> 02:44:06.460
<v Speaker 5>your team supports.</v>

3421
02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:11.460
<v Speaker 5>Like I see a lot of people online </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about this immigrant issue and </v>

3422
02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:14.880
<v Speaker 5>they either don't have kids or they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think it could happen to their </v>

3423
02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:14.880
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their ideas,</v>

3424
02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:15.820
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't could come over here.</v>

3425
02:44:15.850 --> 02:44:19.150
<v Speaker 5>You get those broke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The law shouldn't have fucking come over</v>

3426
02:44:19.151 --> 02:44:21.130
<v Speaker 5>here if you didn't want to get your kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>separated.</v>

3427
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:26.520
<v Speaker 5>If you were in the presence of a woman </v>
<v Speaker 5>who came over here from Guatemala and </v>

3428
02:44:27.671 --> 02:44:32.671
<v Speaker 5>she's poor and she's starving and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're taking her baby away and she's </v>

3429
02:44:32.671 --> 02:44:36.841
<v Speaker 5>wailing and screaming from a primal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>primal place in her,</v>

3430
02:44:37.330 --> 02:44:41.080
<v Speaker 5>her DNA that the one thing she loves </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than anything is being taken away a</v>

3431
02:44:41.081 --> 02:44:42.190
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3432
02:44:42.191 --> 02:44:44.260
<v Speaker 5>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that doesn't freak you the fuck out,</v>

3433
02:44:44.261 --> 02:44:45.850
<v Speaker 5>you're not a part of the team,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3434
02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:47.650
<v Speaker 5>you're missing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're missing it.</v>

3435
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:48.820
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we here for?</v>

3436
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.650
<v Speaker 5>We're here for 100 years of whatever.</v>

3437
02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:53.110
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're here for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to spend 100 years,</v>

3438
02:44:53.111 --> 02:44:55.210
<v Speaker 5>say in Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broke the law,</v>

3439
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:58.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're an asshole,</v>

3440
02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.160
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'll give you.</v>

3441
02:44:59.330 --> 02:45:01.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck if you're right or </v>
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>

3442
02:45:01.330 --> 02:45:04.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you're religious or I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't care if you're an atheist,</v>

3443
02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:07.390
<v Speaker 5>if that's what you support,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are an asshole and we don't want you</v>

3444
02:45:07.391 --> 02:45:08.950
<v Speaker 5>on our team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

3445
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:14.010
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you agree with certain economic </v>

3446
02:45:14.010 --> 02:45:14.590
<v Speaker 5>policies that I don't agree with and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could have a discussion about it,</v>

3447
02:45:14.591 --> 02:45:18.940
<v Speaker 5>we could figure out why you agree and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>could figure out why people are allowing</v>

3448
02:45:18.941 --> 02:45:23.941
<v Speaker 5>all of this money to get into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are we allowing all these special </v>

3449
02:45:23.941 --> 02:45:27.781
<v Speaker 5>interest groups and lobbyists to </v>
<v Speaker 5>interfere with our laws and influence </v>

3450
02:45:27.781 --> 02:45:27.781
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

3451
02:45:27.781 --> 02:45:31.921
<v Speaker 5>our politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and create all this shit that we don't </v>

3452
02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:31.921
<v Speaker 5>want?</v>

3453
02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:32.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the number one reason.</v>

3454
02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:36.640
<v Speaker 5>You can't just vote online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just vote one person,</v>

3455
02:45:36.641 --> 02:45:39.160
<v Speaker 5>one vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the electoral college and there's a</v>

3456
02:45:39.161 --> 02:45:40.600
<v Speaker 5>lot of checks and balances that are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3457
02:45:40.601 --> 02:45:45.601
<v Speaker 5>That's all wonderful and groovy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not giving the trust to the </v>

3458
02:45:45.601 --> 02:45:45.601
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trusted the people that are.</v>

3459
02:45:45.601 --> 02:45:47.110
<v Speaker 5>They're informed that they could make </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own decisions,</v>

3460
02:45:47.111 --> 02:45:49.390
<v Speaker 5>that more people should be able to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>the decision,</v>

3461
02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:54.570
<v Speaker 5>but they're happening now that 28 year </v>
<v Speaker 5>old girl who who a 28 year old debt </v>

3462
02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.560
<v Speaker 5>democratic socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether I agree with her or not and I </v>

3463
02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:04.411
<v Speaker 5>don't know if I do or don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet I agree with her on a lot of </v>

3464
02:46:04.411 --> 02:46:04.411
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think education should be free.</v>

3465
02:46:04.411 --> 02:46:05.530
<v Speaker 5>I think we should figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we could pay for bombs,</v>

3466
02:46:05.650 --> 02:46:10.650
<v Speaker 5>we could pay for schools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that this idea that everybody </v>

3467
02:46:10.650 --> 02:46:10.650
<v Speaker 5>should have healthcare.</v>

3468
02:46:10.650 --> 02:46:14.680
<v Speaker 5>It's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck wants people to not be </v>

3469
02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:17.320
<v Speaker 5>healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who wants people to be hurt and not be </v>

3470
02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:17.320
<v Speaker 5>able to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who wants to do?</v>

3471
02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Are you really saying that struggling </v>
<v Speaker 5>people should have to pay exorbitant </v>

3472
02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:25.121
<v Speaker 5>amounts of money to get fixed when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could maybe chip in and help members of </v>

3473
02:46:25.121 --> 02:46:25.121
<v Speaker 5>our team,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stupid paper,</v>

3474
02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.630
<v Speaker 5>fill it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure it out yourself on how to.</v>

3475
02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:29.450
<v Speaker 5>You got lucky bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got lucky.</v>

3476
02:46:29.451 --> 02:46:31.250
<v Speaker 5>You don't have leukemia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't break both your legs.</v>

3477
02:46:31.251 --> 02:46:32.840
<v Speaker 5>When you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your parents are dead.</v>

3478
02:46:33.010 --> 02:46:34.890
<v Speaker 5>You got lucky piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3479
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:39.950
<v Speaker 5>These are people on our team is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not talking about people who are </v>

3480
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.950
<v Speaker 5>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good for nothing.</v>

3481
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Losers mooching off the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have that too.</v>

3482
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:45.650
<v Speaker 5>Where we got to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>educate people so that that happens less</v>

3483
02:46:45.651 --> 02:46:46.130
<v Speaker 5>and less.</v>

3484
02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:47.360
<v Speaker 5>That's what we got to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3485
02:46:47.390 --> 02:46:50.840
<v Speaker 5>That's it you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is it.</v>

3486
02:46:50.841 --> 02:46:53.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to call that thing you</v>
<v Speaker 5>just talked about,</v>

3487
02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:58.660
<v Speaker 5>but like that's happening everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not just happening in the United </v>

3488
02:46:58.660 --> 02:47:00.110
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a global shift that's happening.</v>

3489
02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the video when she found out</v>

3490
02:47:02.181 --> 02:47:07.181
<v Speaker 5>she won this amazing put play it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of the rear realist </v>

3491
02:47:07.181 --> 02:47:08.450
<v Speaker 5>moments and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are angry.</v>

3492
02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:13.480
<v Speaker 5>Twenty eight year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck does she know what she </v>

3493
02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:13.480
<v Speaker 5>doesn't know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'll learn 20,</v>

3494
02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:13.480
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3495
02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:14.810
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out what she learns.</v>

3496
02:47:14.811 --> 02:47:19.811
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she maybe she knows a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the fact she wasn't supposed to </v>

3497
02:47:19.811 --> 02:47:24.341
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like the fact that the guy who was an </v>

3498
02:47:24.341 --> 02:47:26.051
<v Speaker 5>incumbent was a 10 term and come back </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that he spent 10 to one verse on </v>

3499
02:47:26.811 --> 02:47:31.811
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then how much money she spent 10 to one </v>

3500
02:47:31.811 --> 02:47:32.830
<v Speaker 5>in grassroots grassroots elected man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how this.</v>

3501
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:34.970
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can happen too.</v>

3502
02:47:34.971 --> 02:47:36.060
<v Speaker 5>She's a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3503
02:47:36.450 --> 02:47:38.600
<v Speaker 5>she's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a pretty young,</v>

3504
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:40.160
<v Speaker 5>28 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean watch this,</v>

3505
02:47:40.161 --> 02:47:41.390
<v Speaker 5>watch this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When she wins,</v>

3506
02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:42.470
<v Speaker 5>plays it.</v>

3507
02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:50.470
<v Speaker 7>How are you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you put it into words?</v>

3508
02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:57.810
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if Democratic craddick</v>

3509
02:47:57.810 --> 02:48:02.810
<v Speaker 5>socialism is the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know it's a part of the </v>

3510
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:02.810
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3511
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:06.510
<v Speaker 5>And this is the thing that locking out </v>
<v Speaker 5>any ideology in this team as part of the</v>

3512
02:48:06.511 --> 02:48:11.511
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what is democratic socialism </v>

3513
02:48:11.511 --> 02:48:11.511
<v Speaker 5>entail?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what does it entail?</v>

3514
02:48:11.511 --> 02:48:11.511
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3515
02:48:11.511 --> 02:48:13.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy all this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The market will take care.</v>

3516
02:48:13.651 --> 02:48:15.150
<v Speaker 5>It's care of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit.</v>

3517
02:48:15.390 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a certain amount of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to chip in to the community </v>

3518
02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 5>pile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3519
02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>

3520
02:48:20.570 --> 02:48:24.840
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is how efficient and </v>
<v Speaker 5>good is the community pile or the.</v>

3521
02:48:24.841 --> 02:48:26.930
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of lazy constantly community </v>
<v Speaker 5>pile are there.</v>

3522
02:48:27.210 --> 02:48:32.210
<v Speaker 5>Is there waste to nonsense and bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people that have those jobs you </v>

3523
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:33.000
<v Speaker 5>were talking about earlier that told </v>
<v Speaker 5>slow down,</v>

3524
02:48:33.001 --> 02:48:35.310
<v Speaker 5>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you could do this in two hours,</v>

3525
02:48:35.311 --> 02:48:36.960
<v Speaker 5>but you can get an eight hour day out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

3526
02:48:37.350 --> 02:48:38.310
<v Speaker 5>Don't fuck this up.</v>

3527
02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:40.600
<v Speaker 5>How much of that's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want any of that going right?</v>

3528
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:44.830
<v Speaker 5>But if the community pile is taking care</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it and,</v>

3529
02:48:44.831 --> 02:48:46.740
<v Speaker 5>and managed in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

3530
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:52.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an honest and a way that's trustworthy </v>

3531
02:48:52.501 --> 02:48:56.360
<v Speaker 5>and great for all involved and </v>
<v Speaker 5>beneficial to the community and,</v>

3532
02:48:56.740 --> 02:49:01.740
<v Speaker 5>and supportive of community values and </v>
<v Speaker 5>love and this idea that we're all on a </v>

3533
02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:02.640
<v Speaker 5>team and that you're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you break your leg,</v>

3534
02:49:02.641 --> 02:49:03.090
<v Speaker 5>Duncan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3535
02:49:03.091 --> 02:49:05.900
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be okay and we make fun </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Canada's healthcare.</v>

3536
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:07.710
<v Speaker 5>And it's not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the best.</v>

3537
02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend Jen,</v>

3538
02:49:09.421 --> 02:49:12.470
<v Speaker 5>she broke her fucking knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had to get a acl reconstruction.</v>

3539
02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:14.970
<v Speaker 5>They kind of botched it and they had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go back in and fix it again.</v>

3540
02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:16.770
<v Speaker 5>She had to wait forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the best,</v>

3541
02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:22.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something and it maybe that can be </v>

3542
02:49:22.130 --> 02:49:22.130
<v Speaker 5>improved.</v>

3543
02:49:22.130 --> 02:49:22.410
<v Speaker 5>I may be improving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is better.</v>

3544
02:49:22.470 --> 02:49:24.210
<v Speaker 5>Let me throw this in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So have options.</v>

3545
02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:27.390
<v Speaker 5>But I also believe in options for people</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it better.</v>

3546
02:49:27.450 --> 02:49:29.280
<v Speaker 5>Like the surgeons that you can get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States.</v>

3547
02:49:29.281 --> 02:49:32.400
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a guy Dr Getelman to go fix</v>
<v Speaker 5>my knee.</v>

3548
02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:35.330
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy's really got good.</v>

3549
02:49:35.331 --> 02:49:40.331
<v Speaker 5>He does a lot of pro athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he did a great fucking job </v>

3550
02:49:40.331 --> 02:49:40.380
<v Speaker 5>reconstructing my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an artist.</v>

3551
02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with someone like that getting paid </v>

3552
02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:45.680
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think if someone was like,</v>

3553
02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:48.930
<v Speaker 5>I think Lebron James should get paid </v>
<v Speaker 5>more for playing basketball than me.</v>

3554
02:49:49.170 --> 02:49:50.690
<v Speaker 5>If I was playing basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't.</v>

3555
02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:53.220
<v Speaker 5>You pay as much as she's fucking way </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

3556
02:49:53.250 --> 02:49:53.730
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3557
02:49:53.731 --> 02:49:56.880
<v Speaker 5>And I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's that with doctors as well,</v>

3558
02:49:56.881 --> 02:50:00.270
<v Speaker 5>I think with everything as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that it's a lot like there's</v>

3559
02:50:00.271 --> 02:50:01.870
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3560
02:50:01.930 --> 02:50:05.490
<v Speaker 5>a state funded prosecutors or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a defense attorneys,</v>

3561
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:06.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

3562
02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:07.740
<v Speaker 5>where the people can't afford it.</v>

3563
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:08.720
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3564
02:50:08.730 --> 02:50:09.660
<v Speaker 5>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that called?</v>

3565
02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:13.320
<v Speaker 5>What's the offender?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Public public defender,</v>

3566
02:50:13.321 --> 02:50:18.321
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that are really </v>

3567
02:50:18.321 --> 02:50:18.321
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good,</v>

3568
02:50:18.321 --> 02:50:18.321
<v Speaker 5>really young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry,</v>

3569
02:50:18.321 --> 02:50:18.670
<v Speaker 5>very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>

3570
02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:23.740
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to put in their time in </v>

3571
02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:23.740
<v Speaker 5>the public sector or doing it for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the public public defender.</v>

3572
02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:26.760
<v Speaker 5>And then they eventually go onto maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even not do that.</v>

3573
02:50:26.761 --> 02:50:31.761
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they just did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get satisfaction out of helping </v>

3574
02:50:31.761 --> 02:50:34.131
<v Speaker 5>people that don't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean that you shouldn't </v>

3575
02:50:34.131 --> 02:50:36.231
<v Speaker 5>have high priced lawyers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it doesn't mean that people </v>

3576
02:50:36.231 --> 02:50:39.441
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be able to pursue excellence </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be rewarded for that excellence and </v>

3577
02:50:39.441 --> 02:50:40.650
<v Speaker 5>be able to do whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want with it.</v>

3578
02:50:40.890 --> 02:50:45.890
<v Speaker 5>Whether they want to be charitable with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that money or where they want to be </v>

3579
02:50:45.890 --> 02:50:48.411
<v Speaker 5>selfish with that money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're pursuing excellence and </v>

3580
02:50:48.411 --> 02:50:48.890
<v Speaker 5>through their excellence they did.</v>

3581
02:50:49.050 --> 02:50:53.030
<v Speaker 5>They managed to amass an extreme amount </v>
<v Speaker 5>of wealth doing playing the guitar,</v>

3582
02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:55.410
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with that either.</v>

3583
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:57.360
<v Speaker 5>We've got to stop thinking there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something wrong with that,</v>

3584
02:50:57.570 --> 02:51:01.620
<v Speaker 5>but chipping in and everybody putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the company,</v>

3585
02:51:01.621 --> 02:51:04.800
<v Speaker 5>pop is in a sense some form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>socialism,</v>

3586
02:51:04.801 --> 02:51:09.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we agree on some kind of socialism </v>

3587
02:51:09.801 --> 02:51:11.430
<v Speaker 5>like is when you consider like the fire </v>
<v Speaker 5>department,</v>

3588
02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:14.460
<v Speaker 5>the police department.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like social things,</v>

3589
02:51:14.461 --> 02:51:15.630
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We put money into it.</v>

3590
02:51:15.631 --> 02:51:20.631
<v Speaker 5>It's not a total redistribution of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wealth like deciding how much rich </v>

3591
02:51:20.631 --> 02:51:22.200
<v Speaker 5>people should pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is deciding you got to chip in.</v>

3592
02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:24.420
<v Speaker 5>We all got to chip in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got a chip.</v>

3593
02:51:24.690 --> 02:51:26.880
<v Speaker 5>I just don't feel like the chip and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>is good.</v>

3594
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:32.000
<v Speaker 5>We feel like it's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We feel like there's a bunch of dummies </v>

3595
02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:32.000
<v Speaker 5>out there like this jeff sessions guy.</v>

3596
02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:35.970
<v Speaker 5>That guy gets paid for my chip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This fucking dummy and all these fucking</v>

3597
02:51:35.971 --> 02:51:40.971
<v Speaker 5>people that are robbing the system with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their two hour a day jobs that they're </v>

3598
02:51:40.971 --> 02:51:43.350
<v Speaker 5>stretching out to eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That builds resentment.</v>

3599
02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:48.830
<v Speaker 5>It's poor management and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are listless and they have </v>

3600
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:50.280
<v Speaker 5>these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not valuable jobs and not like a</v>

3601
02:51:50.281 --> 02:51:55.281
<v Speaker 5>job that commands the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention is like some of the more </v>

3602
02:51:55.410 --> 02:51:57.750
<v Speaker 5>attractive jobs that people seek out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3603
02:51:57.751 --> 02:51:58.620
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3604
02:51:58.621 --> 02:52:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all of it's true.</v>

3605
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the what people think is let's wait</v>

3606
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:06.370
<v Speaker 5>for the government to do this</v>

3607
02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:09.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I think the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like instead of thinking like,</v>

3608
02:52:09.731 --> 02:52:10.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3609
02:52:10.391 --> 02:52:15.391
<v Speaker 2>all that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's like figure out a way to get more </v>

3610
02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:17.980
<v Speaker 2>taxpayer money out of the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex out of the prisons.</v>

3611
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it in the neighborhoods that </v>

3612
02:52:23.250 --> 02:52:23.290
<v Speaker 2>need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get it for funding education,</v>

3613
02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:28.500
<v Speaker 2>all of that is really beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's still in and you want to </v>

3614
02:52:29.321 --> 02:52:32.290
<v Speaker 2>vote and make all that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grassroots movements,</v>

3615
02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:37.320
<v Speaker 2>all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also think of the term socialism,</v>

3616
02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:38.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just what is it?</v>

3617
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't have to wait for the</v>

3618
02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:46.951
<v Speaker 2>state to come and start figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to tax people to make that pile of </v>

3619
02:52:47.621 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 2>money happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is.</v>

3620
02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:54.550
<v Speaker 2>This is where I think it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing to start exploring the</v>

3621
02:52:54.551 --> 02:52:59.551
<v Speaker 2>idea of intentional communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying starting a commune or </v>

3622
02:52:59.551 --> 02:53:03.091
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can actually push your </v>

3623
02:53:03.091 --> 02:53:04.300
<v Speaker 2>friendship group to the next level.</v>

3624
02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't just have to be a random</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of friends who knows each other.</v>

3625
02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Like you can start that pile of opulence</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a group of friends where it's like,</v>

3626
02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:18.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A group of friends can just agree with </v>

3627
02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:18.420
<v Speaker 2>each other like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3628
02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:20.560
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be homeless.</v>

3629
02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fucking give you money </v>

3630
02:53:25.980 --> 02:53:26.020
<v Speaker 2>all the Goddamn time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you like,</v>

3631
02:53:26.290 --> 02:53:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're like,</v>

3632
02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:31.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to say any of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit except hey,</v>

3633
02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:33.670
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is always okay.</v>

3634
02:53:33.690 --> 02:53:34.840
<v Speaker 2>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're okay.</v>

3635
02:53:34.970 --> 02:53:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3636
02:53:36.570 --> 02:53:39.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what you and I did when you moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in with Joe.</v>

3637
02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I know man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forget about that sometimes.</v>

3638
02:53:43.210 --> 02:53:45.790
<v Speaker 2>We lived together for like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't forget about it.</v>

3639
02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3640
02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:47.500
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3641
02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:48.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3642
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I'm saying is like </v>

3643
02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:54.940
<v Speaker 2>everyone right now and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I understand why I'm in,</v>

3644
02:53:54.970 --> 02:53:59.970
<v Speaker 2>but to me there seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonic about the public fixation on the</v>

3645
02:54:00.251 --> 02:54:02.260
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the state.</v>

3646
02:54:02.261 --> 02:54:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Is this like dragon and it's like got </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3647
02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3648
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a daddy.</v>

3649
02:54:09.140 --> 02:54:13.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a multi-arm daddy with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking laser pointers that it's got the</v>

3650
02:54:13.211 --> 02:54:16.960
<v Speaker 2>entire population watching like cats </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around.</v>

3651
02:54:16.961 --> 02:54:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3652
02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:20.060
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did that.</v>

3653
02:54:20.061 --> 02:54:21.340
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he did that.</v>

3654
02:54:21.341 --> 02:54:22.640
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did that.</v>

3655
02:54:22.700 --> 02:54:24.920
<v Speaker 7>When will this change?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When will this change</v>

3656
02:54:25.020 --> 02:54:29.040
<v Speaker 2>your phone's ringing gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's fucking calling your dad?</v>

3657
02:54:29.250 --> 02:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad?</v>

3658
02:54:31.230 --> 02:54:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call Your fucking dad back the whole </v>

3659
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.520
<v Speaker 2>time you were like,</v>

3660
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:37.210
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3661
02:54:37.230 --> 02:54:38.750
<v Speaker 7>Did Dr Dre</v>

3662
02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:40.750
<v Speaker 2>the whole time you're neglecting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

3663
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>You're neglecting your neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're walking down the street looking </v>

3664
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.630
<v Speaker 2>at your phone like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

3665
02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:48.550
<v Speaker 2>He said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3666
02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a fucking blog about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what,</v>

3667
02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:56.881
<v Speaker 2>you're walking by dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're walking by fucking plastic </v>

3668
02:54:56.881 --> 02:54:57.160
<v Speaker 2>bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>piles of fucking trash,</v>

3669
02:54:57.370 --> 02:55:02.370
<v Speaker 2>three fucking mathematics in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking woman who just got beaten by her</v>

3670
02:55:02.651 --> 02:55:04.310
<v Speaker 2>husband is now living on the streets</v>

3671
02:55:04.310 --> 02:55:08.390
<v Speaker 6>for the last couple of weeks and you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>got fucking $40,000</v>

3672
02:55:08.391 --> 02:55:10.460
<v Speaker 6>in the bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Liquid.</v>

3673
02:55:11.410 --> 02:55:14.600
<v Speaker 6>And when I say that to the garden you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can touch.</v>

3674
02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.010
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

3675
02:55:16.011 --> 02:55:21.011
<v Speaker 6>Tend to the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can touch and do it in an organized </v>

3676
02:55:21.011 --> 02:55:21.530
<v Speaker 6>way and then like maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but don't you have a garden that you can</v>

3677
02:55:21.531 --> 02:55:23.660
<v Speaker 6>touch this giant or you think about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3678
02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:28.900
<v Speaker 6>Think about what you've done during this</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast and some of the things that </v>

3679
02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:32.531
<v Speaker 6>you've said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You basically touched an enormous </v>

3680
02:55:32.531 --> 02:55:32.531
<v Speaker 6>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3681
02:55:32.531 --> 02:55:32.531
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3682
02:55:32.531 --> 02:55:33.500
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one.</v>

3683
02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:37.460
<v Speaker 6>That's a really easy way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm a Yappy motherfucker.</v>

3684
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:40.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no in your life too,</v>

3685
02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:42.680
<v Speaker 6>but that counts too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it does count,</v>

3686
02:55:42.890 --> 02:55:47.890
<v Speaker 6>but I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would be easy to do things like that </v>

3687
02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:47.890
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3688
02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:50.240
<v Speaker 6>and still forget about something that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>really basic,</v>

3689
02:55:50.241 --> 02:55:52.100
<v Speaker 6>which is now that I'm talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>

3690
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:57.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking to myself right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in my neighborhood,</v>

3691
02:55:58.041 --> 02:55:59.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

3692
02:55:59.301 --> 02:56:01.220
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what am I not doing?</v>

3693
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:06.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is yet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I guarantee you there's something </v>

3694
02:56:06.250 --> 02:56:06.250
<v Speaker 6>that I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3695
02:56:06.250 --> 02:56:10.340
<v Speaker 6>and I liked that man because he knew </v>
<v Speaker 6>like tithing to the church.</v>

3696
02:56:10.370 --> 02:56:13.580
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So to me that I think we may have talked</v>

3697
02:56:13.581 --> 02:56:18.581
<v Speaker 6>about this before but I get it and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>but like it always seemed like a really </v>

3698
02:56:19.850 --> 02:56:23.300
<v Speaker 6>boring way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the plate comes by,</v>

3699
02:56:23.301 --> 02:56:27.680
<v Speaker 6>you throw some money and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It goes to church stuff you don't know.</v>

3700
02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:32.060
<v Speaker 6>But the idea of tithing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's something to it which is</v>

3701
02:56:32.061 --> 02:56:35.210
<v Speaker 6>like if you just kind of look at your </v>
<v Speaker 6>income and you think,</v>

3702
02:56:35.211 --> 02:56:40.211
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five percent of this shit is gonna get </v>

3703
02:56:40.211 --> 02:56:41.450
<v Speaker 6>spent or 10 percent or whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>comfortable with.</v>

3704
02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:46.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm putting that in a pile and that pile</v>
<v Speaker 6>is going to helping people in my </v>

3705
02:56:47.211 --> 02:56:51.920
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood or my friends or my family </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm just going to give that away.</v>

3706
02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:55.460
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's something to be said for</v>

3707
02:56:55.461 --> 02:57:00.461
<v Speaker 6>that because right now I think we were a</v>
<v Speaker 6>little too fixated on the daddy state </v>

3708
02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:05.900
<v Speaker 6>helping us and I think it's more </v>
<v Speaker 6>important that we start helping each </v>

3709
02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:09.221
<v Speaker 6>other and forming communities with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are based on love and friendship and </v>

3710
02:57:09.261 --> 02:57:14.261
<v Speaker 6>just figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of the communities are going to </v>

3711
02:57:14.261 --> 02:57:16.030
<v Speaker 6>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of them are going to get a couple </v>

3712
02:57:16.030 --> 02:57:16.030
<v Speaker 6>of assholes in there who are con artists</v>
<v Speaker 6>and trick.</v>

3713
02:57:16.030 --> 02:57:18.290
<v Speaker 6>Everybody are lazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the main thing is,</v>

3714
02:57:18.291 --> 02:57:23.291
<v Speaker 6>is like let's start thinking in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 6>organizing into communities that aren't </v>

3715
02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:27.680
<v Speaker 6>based on a fixation on the government </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>

3716
02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:30.860
<v Speaker 6>And then let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And with that,</v>

3717
02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:35.920
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we conclude another episode of the Joe </v>
