<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>If you say sweet baby,</v>

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.560

<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>How about if you only say sweet baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus in a nice way.</v>

9
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>See Baby Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet Baby Jesus.</v>

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Sexually sounding though like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophiles.</v>

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>You're tasting Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.</v>

13
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't they do eat the flesh and drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood anyway?</v>

14
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got freaky.</v>

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>He's responsible for basically any </v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy notions that people have just by </v>

16
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that's true,</v>

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>why tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep the kid.</v>

18
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Give him some bread and wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we barely believe he came back </v>

19
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

26
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pitch?</v>

32
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:32.781
<v Speaker 1>if you're like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why this podcast started a </v>

33
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>half an hour late because we live in Los</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles and there's too many fucking </v>

34
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.391
<v Speaker 1>people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get stuck in your car and it </v>

35
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>could either be frustrating or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to some cool shit.</v>

36
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

37
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:45.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening on the way up here to a </v>

38
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>podcast so you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can listen to audio books because</v>

39
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>in podcast oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you read this,</v>

40
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>listen to this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a lot of information</v>

41
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>that might not necessarily be true.</v>

42
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It also might not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not necessarily be able to be </v>

43
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.281
<v Speaker 1>pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not necessarily be good for </v>

44
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.041
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might tell you some shit just for a </v>

45
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:07.041
<v Speaker 1>goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

46
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you get like a really good book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very least you might learn </v>

47
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whisper sync,</v>

48
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>which is one of my favorite new </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>

49
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:19.671
<v Speaker 1>It's really one of the coolest things </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard of and what it is for </v>

50
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>audible.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an application that allows you to </v>

51
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>download a book and a companion audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

52
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So say if you're at home reading your </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and you get to page 23 and then you</v>

53
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:35.331
<v Speaker 1>fall asleep when you get in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have it sync up through this whisper</v>

71
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.600

<v Speaker 1>all the regular book dealers.</v>

72
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a big issue that he had </v>

73
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to barnes and noble.</v>

76
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

77
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Steven Pressfield is a great read of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

78
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to some of his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually him reading it and talking</v>

79
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

80
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are perfect to recommend because </v>

81
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>those are two of my favorite books of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time turning pro,</v>

82
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>which is the newest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pressfield put out a book that </v>

84
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>changed a lot of people's lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative business and it's called the </v>

85
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.161
<v Speaker 1>war of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it deals with one thing that really </v>

86
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 1>fucks with a lot of people and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastination,</v>

87
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance,</v>

88
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>meaning that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most happy when you get your work</v>

89
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do the things you,</v>

90
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>especially creatively that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

91
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we struggle with this thing that makes </v>

92
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>us fuck off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing what you're supposed to</v>

93
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you beat off you email people you find,</v>

94
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you find shit to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to distract you.</v>

95
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And he details us and explains this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the clearest and most </v>

96
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 1>beneficial ways I think I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>it described,</v>

97
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll be surprised you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read his book,</v>

98
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you feel like he's talking to you and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

99
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

100
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:54.861
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get in my head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all of the things that prevent </v>

101
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you from doing what you could and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do,</v>

102
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about the fears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doubts.</v>

103
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:02.331
<v Speaker 2>The procrastination is like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned all of that and gives it a </v>

104
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:02.331
<v Speaker 2>name resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you name it,</v>

105
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>then you can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that Arnold Schwarzenegger </v>

106
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>with a Predator once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's.</v>

107
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>You can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And the cool thing about pressfield </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressfield as a human being was </v>

109
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>essentially a failure at the time he </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

110
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Got it all together when he was in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties.</v>

111
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frank about his old habits and very</v>

113
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:28.891
<v Speaker 1>frank about his old work and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was wrong with the early part of </v>

114
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his career as a writer and how he turned</v>

115
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>it around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's hugely,</v>

116
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:38.161
<v Speaker 1>hugely respected and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written huge selling books on history </v>

117
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>has some screenplays that were turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into movies like the legend of Bagger </v>

118
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Vance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably isn't a good example </v>

119
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>because it looked like a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it,</v>

120
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's magical black guy that's good at </v>

121
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of here,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because it's fucking sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said it's that right?</v>

128
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

129
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it on audio powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audible and uh,</v>

130
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 2>we're also brought to you by [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot com.</v>

131
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>And what a coincidence at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and is here buddy?</v>

132
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

133
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you tell everybody about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest shit because every time I turn </v>

134
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>around there's new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some Himalayan sea salt,</v>

135
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 2>which is that a new better for you than </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular season Himalayan sea salt.</v>

136
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:33.621
<v Speaker 2>The deal with that is normal sea salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They artificially produce it and it's </v>

137
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:34.900
<v Speaker 2>sodium chloride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's artificially produced.</v>

138
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

139
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:41.531
<v Speaker 2>Just bond the chemicals together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is when they call that </v>

140
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>sea salt sea salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just regular table salt,</v>

141
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>like what you'll find at your denny's </v>
<v Speaker 2>diner or whatever,</v>

142
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of.</v>

143
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 2>And what they did is they found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people started getting mineral </v>

144
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>imbalances when they created that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having health problems,</v>

145
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:57.701
<v Speaker 2>particularly from the lack of iodine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people were acquiring mostly from </v>

146
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:01.691
<v Speaker 2>their salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you get iodized salt </v>

147
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:01.691
<v Speaker 2>because they threw that back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

148
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well at least give them iodine back,</v>

149
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 2>but what they're missing is the 81 other</v>
<v Speaker 2>trace minerals that are found in a </v>

150
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 2>natural salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Himalayan salt,</v>

151
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 2>so has about 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 more minerals than regular salt.</v>

152
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a great source to get your mineral </v>
<v Speaker 2>content and in addition,</v>

153
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:21.401
<v Speaker 2>the reason why the Himalayan is most </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferred is because the deposits are </v>

154
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:24.851
<v Speaker 2>like $300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years old and that's before </v>

155
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:27.491
<v Speaker 2>there was pollution as before big old </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships dropped petroleum bombs into our </v>

156
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 2>waters and polluted the sea salt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything like that.</v>

157
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:35.351
<v Speaker 2>It's just a really pristine deposit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>salt because it was back in the days </v>

158
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>where there is just volcano.</v>

159
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>No dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

161
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Tara dactyl poo is like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem back then as far as</v>

162
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.680
<v Speaker 2>far as pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you buy a biologist,</v>

163
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>let's just be clear about this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you buy sea salt though,</v>

164
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>something says sea salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to come from the ocean.</v>

165
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Sea Salt is pretty good because we kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of said that accidentally earlier you </v>

166
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>were saying they make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he just meant tables.</v>

167
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Table salt table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt table,</v>

168
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:05.670
<v Speaker 2>so the difference between sea salt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Himalayan Sea salt is what?</v>

169
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just more nutritious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nutrition as,</v>

170
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 2>as lot of mineral content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of see that in the pink,</v>

171
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the mineralization from it and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more mineralization and a </v>

172
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 2>more pristine deposit so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it tastes better too.</v>

173
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Once you start using it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have that sharp bite.</v>

174
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Salt has a real bite to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This just has the flavor of salt so you </v>

175
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>can actually use a little bit more salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you use it when you grill?</v>

176
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I use kosher salt.</v>

177
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've always used for </v>
<v Speaker 2>grilling.</v>

178
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 2>We better really formula though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing now.</v>

179
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Just sobbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm I tried out this week now.</v>

180
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 2>What about killer bee honey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

181
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Is that any better than regular honey or</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it just bad ass?</v>

182
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just how do they get this killer bees to</v>

183
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 2>deposit this honey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 2>isn't it dangerous to farm those </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers?</v>

185
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>There'd be pimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand strong.</v>

186
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They</v>

187
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.250
<v Speaker 1>just keep them high when they're blowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

188
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be.</v>

189
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be cool if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>The idea is the smoke confuses them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>calms them down.</v>

192
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.330
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't you use wheats monk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that would affect your </v>

193
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.401
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall sudden the hive got super </v>

194
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.180
<v Speaker 1>creative and harmony and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>control them and shit.</v>

195
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Making art project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they stopped working for the Queen</v>

196
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:25.461
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing we get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would realize that I doing with </v>

197
00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>this queen bee is a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they would realize like the queen bee</v>

198
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 1>is the only be that can sting you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not die.</v>

199
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she uses that Stinger to murder </v>

200
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.360
<v Speaker 1>baby females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why lemonade and competent,</v>

201
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>she uses that Stinger and most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies that die in the,</v>

202
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:47.121
<v Speaker 1>in the hive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die from wounds from the side wall </v>

203
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>while the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>the female walks around a realizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a female grown in there.</v>

205
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 1>So she pulls out a tap in Paris Stinger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just starts fucking up that baby </v>

206
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>while its in the Walton the hive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about that.</v>

207
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegans will need hunting strict vegans.</v>

208
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you said it is man,</v>

209
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>but who are we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are reading meet these bees work for</v>

210
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:14.511
<v Speaker 1>us man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the things we were talking </v>

211
00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>about before the podcast and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking so legit.</v>

212
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:20.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm drinking this starbucks coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>man is it tastes like shit compared to </v>

213
00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof coffee and I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a mycotoxins.</v>

214
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen is something that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got alerted to by Dave asprey,</v>

215
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Dave asprey of bulletproof exec.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating guy with a lot of knowledge </v>

216
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:38.481
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to health and wellness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a optimum living and he sells this stuff</v>

217
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:45.171
<v Speaker 1>called bulletproof coffee and what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>is coffee from a single source that is </v>

218
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:49.881
<v Speaker 1>cultivated and maintained to be mold </v>
<v Speaker 1>free and you're like what do you mean </v>

219
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:49.881
<v Speaker 1>mold free?</v>

220
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something I didn't know about </v>

221
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.051
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most coffee that you buy has mold on it </v>

222
00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tasting this right now and it tastes</v>

223
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:04.371
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking shitty in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bulletproof coffee because last </v>

224
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>week I stopped drinking any regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee and just went 100 per 100 percent</v>

225
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:13.281
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof and the mycotoxins like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really can affect you.</v>

226
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:18.801
<v Speaker 1>They affect your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they affect the way you feel after you </v>

227
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crash.</v>

228
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fresh.</v>

229
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like it adds on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It compels from the caffeine is going to</v>

230
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>leave your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way that coffee has that kind of</v>

231
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>savage crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like that's from the toxins.</v>

232
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I different coffee.</v>

233
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fucking disturbing to me </v>

235
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>that starbucks is essentially selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>

236
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Who Don't sue me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just allegedly allegedly.</v>

237
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me.</v>

238
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>What do I know?</v>

239
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I told you at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a lot of false </v>

240
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.670
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

241
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I would like to get it tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

242
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could do that.</v>

243
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Can we test our marks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we go to like we probably get sued </v>

244
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>if we did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just didn't use her name.</v>

245
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.190
<v Speaker 1>We said we went to Dave's doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

246
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming out.</v>

247
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:04.321
<v Speaker 1>We're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's comparing performance monitors for </v>

248
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:05.330
<v Speaker 1>both bulletproof and for starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully we'll get there.</v>

249
00:12:05.331 --> 00:12:08.700
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By a double blind placebo.</v>

250
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Someone's drinking bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's drinking regular and I'm </v>

251
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>testing some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a double blind.</v>

252
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:19.351
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of like an open ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>single arm research and doing something </v>

253
00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is You gonna name?</v>

254
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks coffee bean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Shit.</v>

255
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets troublesome.</v>

256
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come after you,</v>

257
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 1>but it would be nice if they didn't sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

258
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know.</v>

260
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people when you drink coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like shit,</v>

261
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't really understand what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

262
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:41.311
<v Speaker 1>but you are drinking poisonous fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous and it sounds like </v>

263
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be hearing about that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear factor guy feel like that would</v>

264
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.740
<v Speaker 1>be some shit that would be in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be some shit because so many </v>

265
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.701
<v Speaker 1>people go to starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be some shit that we would know </v>

266
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:53.701
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

267
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

268
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

269
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing exists,</v>

270
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:02.941
<v Speaker 1>not just in coffee but also in corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been researching mycotoxins online </v>

271
00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>after having that conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

272
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.180
<v Speaker 1>some disturbing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

273
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but if you try out bulletproof coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we still selling it cheaper than </v>

274
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Dave asprey has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the same price.</v>

275
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like that though.</v>

276
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 1>You're selling cheaper than him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fantastic coffee and I swear to</v>

277
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.871
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is different in its effect on your </v>

278
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>body and you really need to try it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand what the fuck is going on.</v>

279
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>A stuff's not cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could find some other version</v>

280
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>where you can be sure that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbe free,</v>

281
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I suggest go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then do whatever you can,</v>

282
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:42.511
<v Speaker 1>but get that shit out of your life like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to finish this because it </v>

283
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:43.540
<v Speaker 1>tastes fucking nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got a Venti starbucks.</v>

284
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how much an effect the </v>

285
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.631
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Dave's formula for bulletproof </v>

286
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:54.631
<v Speaker 1>coffee is really fucking interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is is coffee and then he takes </v>

287
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:59.371
<v Speaker 1>mct oil and mct oil is also something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we sell it on it and mct oil is </v>

288
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:03.991
<v Speaker 1>coconut oil that gets thrown through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrifuge and it gets spun around like </v>

289
00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:07.951
<v Speaker 1>wicked fast and they take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolates the most nutritious aspect of </v>

290
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:07.951
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

291
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And then they take that out and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>adds this mct oil to the coffee along </v>

292
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>with grass fed butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you blend that bitch,</v>

293
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a scoop of hemp force in there.</v>

294
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Go licious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delicious.</v>

295
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That is the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secret.</v>

296
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll remark as powerful move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one scoop.</v>

297
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 12 grams.</v>

298
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

299
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And throw it in a blender.</v>

300
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You want to make sure your blender is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight though.</v>

301
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.310
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one of them,</v>

302
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:34.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.240
<v Speaker 1>old school blenders and I tried to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof coffee and fucking shot off </v>

304
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the top and it was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The counter is a mess,</v>

305
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but there's a Blendtec blenders can </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>

306
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

307
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:49.351
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you mix it all together and the </v>

308
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:51.841
<v Speaker 1>coffee is sensation that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the best tasting shit </v>

309
00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you'll ever had in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

310
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like warm and it's like it's creamy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's got the grass fed butter in</v>

311
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 3>it and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

312
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 3>really good and I'm telling you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will have a different effect and how</v>

313
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 3>the caffeine and how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how your body feels a after the coffee.</v>

314
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no big major crash like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>get with regular shit.</v>

315
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really interested to see what Dave </v>

316
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.591
<v Speaker 3>asprey's results are because I tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that we're going to realize in a </v>

317
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>couple of years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

318
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:23.681
<v Speaker 3>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been poisoning ourselves with </v>

319
00:15:23.681 --> 00:15:23.681
<v Speaker 3>fungus.</v>

320
00:15:23.681 --> 00:15:25.410
<v Speaker 4>I used to think a coffee and I think you</v>
<v Speaker 4>had somebody mentioned it to you,</v>

321
00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:30.411
<v Speaker 4>but it was almost like a hard drug at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that point was you're going to take </v>

322
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:33.781
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that there's going to be a </v>

323
00:15:33.781 --> 00:15:35.271
<v Speaker 4>consequence down the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now you can drink it and I feel </v>

324
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:35.271
<v Speaker 4>consequence free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like,</v>

325
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:35.271
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

326
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:35.590
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

327
00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:36.640
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have some coffee.</v>

328
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As energetic as I did during the peak.</v>

329
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have that.</v>

330
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.390
<v Speaker 3>It's smoother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on smoother and leaves me there.</v>

331
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had coffee before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me want to fall asleep.</v>

332
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Like you have a company like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

333
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:52.240
<v Speaker 3>I just need to take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just totally yawning and nodding out.</v>

334
00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is in that coffee?</v>

335
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Poisoned fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

336
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.240
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

337
00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:03.241
<v Speaker 3>on its selling its own coconut oil now </v>
<v Speaker 3>labeled coconut oil that just got to my </v>

338
00:16:04.301 --> 00:16:04.870
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

339
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

340
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.470
<v Speaker 4>So what we're doing here is it seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're adding a lot of these random </v>

341
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.831
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically what we're trying to do is </v>

342
00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:16.601
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to create a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>program that can help people on the </v>

343
00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 4>supplement side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the fitness side,</v>

344
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.660
<v Speaker 4>and give them some key staple foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can replace some of their other </v>

345
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 4>poorer quality foods with like the salt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the coffee,</v>

346
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:29.711
<v Speaker 4>like the raw honey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the key about the killer bee honey </v>

347
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:32.271
<v Speaker 4>is it is raw and the way that you digest</v>
<v Speaker 4>that with the natural enzymes included </v>

348
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 4>in the minerals way better for you than </v>
<v Speaker 4>process cooked honey.</v>

349
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.280
<v Speaker 4>So all of these different food sources </v>
<v Speaker 4>allow you to replace some other crap </v>

350
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.241
<v Speaker 4>that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tonka bars are natural buffalo and </v>

351
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:43.241
<v Speaker 4>cranberry bars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

352
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 4>take those and throw out your slim Jims </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever else you're snacking on.</v>

353
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to be a better </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative.</v>

354
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.300
<v Speaker 4>So that way on the food side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know we're not going to have every </v>

355
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:52.300
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your staple diet,</v>

356
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 4>you're still gonna have to go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat nutritious,</v>

357
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 4>drink your Kale shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do whatever you can,</v>

358
00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.220
<v Speaker 4>but on some of the staples and some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the additives that you're normally </v>

359
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.581
<v Speaker 4>putting in your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're helping to provide a better </v>

360
00:17:03.581 --> 00:17:06.641
<v Speaker 4>alternative for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course on the supplement </v>

361
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:06.641
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've all talked about that a lot,</v>

362
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:10.871
<v Speaker 4>but trying to create high performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>highly densely packed nutritional </v>

363
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:13.530
<v Speaker 4>supplements around a certain issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

364
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 4>brain mood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>

365
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever we can think of that we can </v>

366
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:20.890
<v Speaker 4>pack together as many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

367
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 4>powerful ingredients in one formula and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and provide that and next coming up,</v>

368
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 4>which is still a little top secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't released the details,</v>

369
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:29.580
<v Speaker 4>but we have our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

370
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 4>testosterone and performance supplement </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up,</v>

371
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 4>which I'm really stoked about.</v>

372
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.420
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think that testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements are bullshit and the reason </v>

373
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.020
<v Speaker 3>why they think that is because most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them are bullshit.</v>

374
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.560
<v Speaker 3>But there are some things that can boost</v>
<v Speaker 3>your testosterone naturally.</v>

375
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

376
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful Zma as one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The beautiful thing about accompany,</v>

377
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 1>like on it is you own the company so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work for anybody.</v>

378
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>So you can stock the store with cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

379
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to like get it approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

380
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 1>like I've had conversations with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the blender conversation.</v>

381
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.620
<v Speaker 1>We had a conversation today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

382
00:18:05.621 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should carry blenders.</v>

383
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Carrie blenders,</v>

384
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Carrie and blenders,</v>

385
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the things we talked about </v>

386
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't done anything about yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about.</v>

387
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about an on it hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>

388
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about it and we're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about we could start selling </v>

389
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen grass fed meat,</v>

390
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.050
<v Speaker 1>frozen grassfed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venison and selling it to people.</v>

391
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.430
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that if you eat meat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of meat,</v>

392
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to be responsible at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat for how that animal lives and </v>

393
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 1>if we decide to start selling grassfed </v>
<v Speaker 1>venison,</v>

394
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple different ways to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is if you have a high </v>

395
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 1>fence operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in Texas,</v>

396
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of branches now.</v>

397
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a big fence around it and </v>

398
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 1>there's deer that live inside there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

399
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.840
<v Speaker 1>You basically set up tree stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait for one to catch up,</v>

400
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 1>slipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you blast them.</v>

401
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you do that,</v>

402
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

403
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:14.751
<v Speaker 1>You can eat that meat or you could sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>it online if we set up a place like that</v>

404
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 1>where we can take people on their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting adventure,</v>

405
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.120
<v Speaker 1>like literally like bring people to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where you'll allow them to kill </v>

406
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 1>their own meat and doing it in a humane </v>
<v Speaker 1>and safe way,</v>

407
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but do it also in a way where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively insured of success,</v>

408
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but this animal is living a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural life before you come along and </v>

409
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 1>pop a cap in his ass.</v>

410
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being directly hands on with your food </v>

411
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 4>source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing what it's eating,</v>

412
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.870
<v Speaker 4>knowing what you're eating and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing a role in that.</v>

413
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:51.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a part of the birthright of </v>

414
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:51.871
<v Speaker 4>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it good for your health,</v>

415
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:52.490
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

416
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.600
<v Speaker 4>important for your spirit if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating meat that somebody else's killing</v>

417
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.210
<v Speaker 4>your whole life without actually going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the process.</v>

418
00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Something a little weird about that.</v>

419
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people have a </v>

420
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.150
<v Speaker 1>disconnect from their food and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that if you,</v>

421
00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:13.040
<v Speaker 1>if we had a place where you could go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be very large,</v>

422
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 1>large enough where it doesn't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting deer in the backyard </v>

423
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.150
<v Speaker 1>because that's the big knock on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>high fence operations.</v>

424
00:20:20.151 --> 00:20:22.310
<v Speaker 1>It's canned hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

425
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.340
<v Speaker 1>but really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like if it's a large enough piece of </v>

426
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.791
<v Speaker 1>property management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're managing the population of the </v>

427
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:32.660
<v Speaker 1>animals and your manager from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

428
00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You procure,</v>

429
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you're procuring food and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially like,</v>

430
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you're harvesting these animals in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>way different than farming.</v>

431
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Like if we started our own grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle operation,</v>

432
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.870
<v Speaker 1>that will be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

433
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.420
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're setting</v>

434
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.430
<v Speaker 3>these animals up to die and they walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>around eating grass and you come along </v>

435
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.621
<v Speaker 3>and you choose when to kill one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it like that more than it is </v>

436
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:58.620
<v Speaker 3>like wild hunting because you know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

437
00:20:58.621 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 3>there is no mystery as to whether there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a stock pond.</v>

438
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just about going out there and </v>

439
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>getting them in a completely natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

440
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.801
<v Speaker 3>but before you come along and get them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that animal is doing what it would do </v>

441
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

442
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.170
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand years ago,</v>

443
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 3>2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's living a natural life.</v>

444
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just living in a natural and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have to do with predators.</v>

445
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you have a large piece of land</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

446
00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:25.330
<v Speaker 3>you have mountain lions period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have wild pigs period.</v>

447
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 3>And both of those eat babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>

448
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 3>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat baby pigs or a baby deer.</v>

449
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.230
<v Speaker 3>So they deal with probation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really a,</v>

450
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:35.050
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contained ecosystem.</v>

451
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 3>And so we're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the preliminary stages,</v>

452
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's the future pitches </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be big.</v>

453
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:45.270
<v Speaker 3>We're bringing you crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n e t and </v>

454
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.991
<v Speaker 3>use the code name Rogan and save </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself 10 percent off any and all </v>

455
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:52.171
<v Speaker 3>supplements that does not apply to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fitness equipment because we sell that </v>

456
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:55.621
<v Speaker 3>shit is cheap as is humanly possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send kettle bells and battle ropes and </v>

457
00:21:55.621 --> 00:21:57.260
<v Speaker 3>shit like that through the mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

458
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.520
<v Speaker 3>extreme kettlebell cardio DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the,</v>

459
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

472
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:38.401
<v Speaker 3>why is my voice off fucking distorted?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you let Nick Diaz talking his </v>

473
00:22:38.401 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 3>regular voice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We fucked my voice up sideways.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Son</v>

475
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.570
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you do that to him?</v>

476
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to hurt his feelings.</v>

477
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you went there.</v>

478
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I can't even believe you went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And good luck.</v>

479
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>So what's up buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on,</v>

480
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

481
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 3>It's always good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing,</v>

482
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 3>the pause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the commercial,</v>

483
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 3>the commercial and then the music and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they start talking part.</v>

484
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most efficient way to do it.</v>

485
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 3>So that's why</v>

486
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.580
<v Speaker 4>everything's been good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

487
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:07.320
<v Speaker 4>It's been a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been a hell of a run Exxon.</v>

488
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:12.350
<v Speaker 4>It's been super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been really exploring some of the </v>

489
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.430
<v Speaker 4>more non psychedelic adventures in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>own life.</v>

490
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:16.200
<v Speaker 4>That had been pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty cool.</v>

491
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:21.230
<v Speaker 4>Some of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I guess you'd say non plant based </v>

492
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.420
<v Speaker 4>experience is really focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 4>deepening meditation.</v>

493
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Learned a really cool thing called </v>
<v Speaker 4>shamonic breathing,</v>

494
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.630
<v Speaker 4>which I was totally skeptical about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard about that?</v>

495
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Now what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

496
00:23:31.861 --> 00:23:36.861
<v Speaker 4>So basically what you do is you create </v>
<v Speaker 4>these really powerful breaths and </v>

497
00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:41.390
<v Speaker 4>consecutively through notes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're hyperventilating and you have </v>

498
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 4>it's best to do this with a guide </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't really know what expect</v>

499
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.520
<v Speaker 4>going through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

500
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

501
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 4>They put on some music and they get you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fired up and they're like,</v>

502
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 4>give it hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

503
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.600
<v Speaker 4>Like you're fighting for something great</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your life and they get you kind of </v>

504
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 4>stoked on this and you start breathing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what you're trying to do actually is</v>

505
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.220
<v Speaker 4>create a state where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

506
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 4>you're purposefully hyperventilating </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

507
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:09.851
<v Speaker 4>which is actually manipulating your Ph </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then constricting some of the blood </v>

508
00:24:09.851 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 4>vessels that go to your go to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

509
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 4>So you're creating choking yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

510
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit out of her erotic fiction a</v>

511
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:22.031
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you're trying to do is like </v>

512
00:24:22.031 --> 00:24:24.671
<v Speaker 4>Aldous Huxley would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is you're trying to obscure the </v>

513
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 4>cognitive filter for long enough that </v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain allows little gaps.</v>

514
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:31.001
<v Speaker 4>It's like opening the blinds in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain a little bit so that the rational </v>

515
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:34.181
<v Speaker 4>mind goes away and it allows whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>else that is even pressfield would call </v>

516
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.030
<v Speaker 4>it the muse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

517
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic people would call it source </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the other,</v>

518
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it.</v>

519
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.020
<v Speaker 4>That other information that comes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't quite just produced by </v>

520
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 4>irrational mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by shutting off a few of the valves,</v>

521
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 4>it's actually kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like you're opening the blinds.</v>

522
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

523
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:54.851
<v Speaker 4>I was totally skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've obviously done some of the most </v>

524
00:24:54.851 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 4>significant plant medicines in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

525
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this shit?</v>

526
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.870
<v Speaker 4>This is just breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I got into it and the first thing </v>

527
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 4>that happens about 10 minutes in as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced what's called tetany,</v>

528
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:09.191
<v Speaker 4>they call it and that's where you like </v>
<v Speaker 4>get really kind of curled up and you </v>

529
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:09.191
<v Speaker 4>feel like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

530
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 4>you have like the claw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can't stretch out your fingers.</v>

531
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Super uncomfortable position with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

532
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 4>keep breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep breathing.</v>

533
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

534
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

535
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.030
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll see what's at the end of this </v>

536
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 4>rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I did and I pushed through that</v>

537
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:27.041
<v Speaker 4>state and about 15 minutes in it turned </v>
<v Speaker 4>full psychedelic experience and it was </v>

538
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

539
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.300
<v Speaker 4>It was cool as shit in 15 minutes then </v>
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes or just heavy crazy bravery,</v>

540
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 4>creativity and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

541
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:41.951
<v Speaker 4>how long do these breaths there fast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me a couple of giving up on right </v>

542
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 4>now and just keep doing that for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes and you can alternate it.</v>

543
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.460
<v Speaker 4>You can alternate doing like little </v>
<v Speaker 4>short ones like you know,</v>

544
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.910
<v Speaker 4>but basically putting out a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of breath and then it's also,</v>

545
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 4>it's best to do this with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're leading because it does create,</v>

546
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 4>you get really kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird state.</v>

547
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:06.701
<v Speaker 4>You're being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually really generating a </v>

548
00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic state so we get in there 15 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes and it was cool.</v>

549
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:12.911
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the dmt experience which </v>
<v Speaker 4>has this what they call the </v>

550
00:26:12.911 --> 00:26:16.331
<v Speaker 4>chrysanthemum have all these colors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Texas and lights and the flotillas </v>

551
00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 4>then I'll all the shit I've previously </v>
<v Speaker 4>described,</v>

552
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's very focused like the vision </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get.</v>

553
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 4>And I had a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me personally,</v>

554
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 4>I had like a whole background that kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of came in.</v>

555
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of like a seamless eternal </v>
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>

556
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:32.231
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred and 60 degrees and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw myself come in but I was like </v>

557
00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:34.140
<v Speaker 4>faceless and I was looking and let your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes open or closed.</v>

558
00:26:34.141 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Closed.</v>

559
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't really see.</v>

560
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 4>If you try to open your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a little dizzy,</v>

561
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.990
<v Speaker 4>you're distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've basically hyperventilated the </v>

562
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:43.990
<v Speaker 4>shit out of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

563
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 4>So when your eyes closed and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing this,</v>

564
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:51.170
<v Speaker 4>and then the most powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transformative moment for me was when I </v>

565
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first time,</v>

566
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:57.471
<v Speaker 4>out of all the medicines I've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a visual depiction of what I </v>

567
00:26:57.471 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 4>believe my God self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my soul,</v>

568
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 4>my spirit self was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

569
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 4>in the Boga experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my true self.</v>

570
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.520
<v Speaker 4>And I heard it talking to me while I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the above at.</v>

571
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.520
<v Speaker 4>That was the one guiding me through with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a blinking cursor going through all the </v>

572
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 4>information in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That voice,</v>

573
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 4>I actually saw it pictured and depicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the physical form.</v>

574
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.080
<v Speaker 4>In that vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it look like it didn't,</v>

575
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.310
<v Speaker 4>is that safe for your lungs or your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brand?</v>

576
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 4>So it was developed by a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by this Guy Stanislav Grof.</v>

577
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 4>And he developed it when acid became </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal,</v>

578
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to create a state that's legal.</v>

579
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Now that acid is illegal because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was his favorite.</v>

580
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 4>So He created this and they've done </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit of study.</v>

581
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it felt,</v>

582
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.880
<v Speaker 4>it felt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

583
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:46.130
<v Speaker 4>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you felt really strong and good </v>

584
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 4>after it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

585
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:51.321
<v Speaker 4>And I've looked around at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies and a couple of people say it's </v>

586
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:54.141
<v Speaker 4>not good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but other people say absolutely no harm </v>

587
00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 4>and done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do your research on that.</v>

588
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Make sure that you're comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's doing to your body</v>

589
00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.990
<v Speaker 2>about the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I.</v>

590
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused as to why it would be bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you while you're doing this.</v>

591
00:28:02.841 --> 00:28:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Breathing heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

592
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not adding any kind of size.</v>

593
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.810
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of thing is it is to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain degree,</v>

594
00:28:08.811 --> 00:28:12.830
<v Speaker 2>except this is actually temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricting some blood flow.</v>

595
00:28:12.831 --> 00:28:14.600
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it doing that though,</v>

596
00:28:14.601 --> 00:28:15.560
<v Speaker 2>by just breathing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

597
00:28:15.561 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>So some mechanism with the Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

598
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.620
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder in through the nose,</v>

599
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:29.621
<v Speaker 2>out through the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This does not make for a good podcast </v>

600
00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:31.880
<v Speaker 2>because this could take like 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could take a while,</v>

601
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:36.050
<v Speaker 2>especially for dropped down to five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

602
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.650
<v Speaker 2>but it manipulates the carbon dioxide </v>
<v Speaker 2>level in your blood.</v>

603
00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:42.740
<v Speaker 2>You're expelling more carbon dioxide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which raises your Ph level.</v>

604
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And by raising your</v>

605
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Ph level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's somehow restricts some of the blood</v>

606
00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 4>vessels which creates this state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

607
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 4>and really there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

608
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.760
<v Speaker 4>when you start to look at the mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 4>of action,</v>

609
00:28:52.761 --> 00:28:57.761
<v Speaker 4>a lot of psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's doing is it's shutting off </v>

610
00:28:57.761 --> 00:28:59.290
<v Speaker 4>certain portions of the brain and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people know.</v>

611
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.750
<v Speaker 4>That's where I really appreciate Aldous </v>
<v Speaker 4>Huxley's view on this,</v>

612
00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:07.751
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot of people think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience is adding </v>

613
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:08.420
<v Speaker 4>something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like adding an experience on.</v>

614
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.610
<v Speaker 4>He's saying all you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not adding shit.</v>

615
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:15.730
<v Speaker 4>You're taking away your mind and by </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking away your mind you allow what's </v>

616
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.231
<v Speaker 4>already there to come through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a reliable legal self </v>

617
00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:22.070
<v Speaker 4>mechanism for getting there.</v>

618
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.460
<v Speaker 2>And it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to say,</v>

619
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.390
<v Speaker 2>where does the average person find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide to do this?</v>

620
00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just look at Google,</v>

621
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 2>your city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is all fucked up.</v>

622
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.940
<v Speaker 2>You got to be careful guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gonna fuck you is gonna.</v>

623
00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shamonic breathing.</v>

624
00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:40.750
<v Speaker 2>You've got to breathe through my day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be careful wherever you go.</v>

625
00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful with Iowasca Maestros.</v>

626
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to be careful with a bogus </v>
<v Speaker 2>shamans.</v>

627
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:46.610
<v Speaker 2>All of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

628
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Put them through your shit last.</v>

629
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know because just because </v>

630
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.601
<v Speaker 3>someone says they're in a bogus shaman </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean anybody could say that now.</v>

631
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean anybody could say they're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca Arrow.</v>

632
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.440
<v Speaker 3>You have to find out whether that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate.</v>

633
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.960
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the unfortunate aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to communicate.</v>

634
00:30:05.961 --> 00:30:06.980
<v Speaker 3>We can also lie.</v>

635
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like a life coach and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that they're a life coach now.</v>

636
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:15.590
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a funny life coach story that </v>

637
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.590
<v Speaker 2>they tell you.</v>

638
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.490
<v Speaker 3>That guy who bangs older rich chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

639
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.370
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned him on the podcast before,</v>

640
00:30:19.371 --> 00:30:23.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when you're around someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just immediately go,</v>

641
00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 3>oh great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking.</v>

642
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:29.850
<v Speaker 3>There was a coyote in the chicken coop </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm watching all these poor old </v>

643
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.641
<v Speaker 3>ladies hang around with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like super charming man with a ponytail </v>

644
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:34.310
<v Speaker 3>and I want to smack them because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

645
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck.</v>

646
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And he's hanging out with these older </v>
<v Speaker 3>broads and he started out as like a </v>

647
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 3>manny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

648
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.950
<v Speaker 3>a male nanny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my friend who lived next door,</v>

649
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking guy away from my wife,</v>

650
00:30:46.941 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

651
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:50.090
<v Speaker 3>like he had a thing about him and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's not very jealous.</v>

652
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.200
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

653
00:30:51.201 --> 00:30:56.201
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then it turns out he starts banging </v>

654
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:56.600
<v Speaker 3>the wife and they get a divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

655
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.110
<v Speaker 2>the husband knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the husband leaves,</v>

656
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.080
<v Speaker 3>now this guy is banging the wife who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich of course.</v>

657
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And now he becomes a life coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a male nanny anymore,</v>

658
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:09.410
<v Speaker 3>he's a life coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

659
00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:14.411
<v Speaker 3>this guy is just a straight con man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a straight con man who moved </v>

660
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.280
<v Speaker 3>into this neighborhood and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing thumb rings,</v>

661
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.520
<v Speaker 2>knee high leather boots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the ponytail,</v>

662
00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to,</v>

663
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.690
<v Speaker 2>can only permit yourself one or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and using it to scam these older ladies.</v>

671

<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting how obvious it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>kind of a bit of a spoof on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on like a commune where everything was </v>

692
00:32:31.161 --> 00:32:36.161
<v Speaker 2>super spiritual guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw the ads for the last </v>

693
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:37.260
<v Speaker 2>wanderlust is the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

694
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 2>main guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty funny.</v>

695
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some super funny</v>

696
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 4>part was that movie vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a fucking God damn.</v>

697
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't great,</v>

698
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have a guy like that ponytail,</v>

699
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:48.790
<v Speaker 4>thumb rings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plays the guitar really soft,</v>

700
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 4>and then he ends up trying to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>polaroids girlfriend</v>

701
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.620
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

702
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what those guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know another guy who will remain,</v>

703
00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 1>remain nameless police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very shamanistic in nature and really </v>

704
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.140
<v Speaker 1>trying to just bank chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are good ones.</v>

705
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.360
<v Speaker 1>There are good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for sure.</v>

706
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.230
<v Speaker 1>The experience is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with David Cho </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this yesterday where I said that </v>

708
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 1>if you took dmt or silicide been or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and someone said to you,</v>

709
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.090
<v Speaker 1>did you just go to [inaudible] dot com </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're gonna get off,</v>

710
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.440
<v Speaker 1>get off that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at these messages.</v>

711
00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see the messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

712
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.150
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:33:27.151 --> 00:33:30.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like look at any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychedelic experience and they say,</v>

714
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hallucinating,</v>

715
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you're just hallucinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my take on it is kind of whether or </v>

716
00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.870
<v Speaker 1>not it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you could take it and put</v>

717
00:33:39.871 --> 00:33:44.871
<v Speaker 1>it in a bag and put a zip lock on it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>set it on a scale and measure it your or</v>

718
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's illumination.</v>

719
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:52.100
<v Speaker 1>The exact same experience happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you think that you are in </v>

720
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.571
<v Speaker 1>another dimension communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent entities or these chemicals </v>

721
00:33:56.571 --> 00:34:01.461
<v Speaker 1>are fucking with your cerebral cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forcing your visual input to get </v>

722
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:04.860
<v Speaker 1>fuck sideways by all this additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's not supposed to be there and</v>

723
00:34:04.861 --> 00:34:07.530
<v Speaker 1>so you have hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

724
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is happening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took magic fairy dust and were </v>

725
00:34:13.141 --> 00:34:18.141
<v Speaker 1>transported into an impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange land where the sky was filled </v>

726
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:22.641
<v Speaker 1>with everchanging geometric patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are made out of love and </v>

727
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:26.211
<v Speaker 1>understanding and they're coming down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and telling you everything that you </v>

728
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:29.271
<v Speaker 1>already know about yourself and telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that they love you or you're </v>

729
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:31.650
<v Speaker 1>hallucinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't in the same thing happening.</v>

730
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:35.220
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is happening to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

731
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.670
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is happening to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and the same thing is happening.</v>

732
00:34:38.671 --> 00:34:43.671
<v Speaker 1>For you to sit back and to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret and try to incorporate into </v>

733
00:34:43.861 --> 00:34:47.010
<v Speaker 1>your view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same exact thing,</v>

734
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 1>whether it's real or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we get caught up in this idea of </v>

735
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.000
<v Speaker 1>what's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is real?</v>

736
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can hit it with a hammer and </v>

737
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.100
<v Speaker 1>is the air real because I can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch that.</v>

738
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we measure it with modern sources?</v>

739
00:35:02.521 --> 00:35:03.930
<v Speaker 1>If we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's real.</v>

740
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

741
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree and you know the.</v>

742
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:11.801
<v Speaker 4>I've been looking at a lot of toltec </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy over recently and they just </v>

743
00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:16.140
<v Speaker 4>dispose of that problem entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call our whole experience the dream</v>

744
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 4>and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cocreated dream by everybody.</v>

745
00:35:18.841 --> 00:35:23.841
<v Speaker 4>They just call it the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The total is what they call it and what </v>

746
00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 4>they say is the most important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not the dream itself,</v>

747
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:29.640
<v Speaker 4>but how that dream interacts with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a completely subjective reality.</v>

748
00:35:29.641 --> 00:35:31.860
<v Speaker 4>If you already think of everything as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dream,</v>

749
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 4>then you stop asking these silly </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions about whether the mushrooms </v>

750
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 4>are doing this so that it's about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience them.</v>

751
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 4>It's about how that translates to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be,</v>

752
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.650
<v Speaker 4>how you're able to see the world better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you're able to find a deeper </v>

753
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.461
<v Speaker 4>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you're able to in what their </v>

754
00:35:49.461 --> 00:35:52.160
<v Speaker 4>worldview is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be the warrior hunter that hunts what </v>

755
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:52.770
<v Speaker 4>they call the parasite inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

756
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Same thing that Steven pressfield calls </v>
<v Speaker 4>resistance.</v>

757
00:35:55.290 --> 00:36:00.290
<v Speaker 4>They call the parasite hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That part of yourself that self </v>

758
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.741
<v Speaker 4>sabotaging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fearful and and that's what they </v>

759
00:36:03.741 --> 00:36:06.891
<v Speaker 4>say is the most important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is getting yourself to those states </v>

760
00:36:06.891 --> 00:36:08.490
<v Speaker 4>where you're aware and you can interact </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the dream on your terms,</v>

761
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.580
<v Speaker 4>set your intent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use your powerful belief to make the </v>

762
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 4>dream a dream of heaven instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dream of hell,</v>

763
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.980
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that your gonna fall into </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a situation where if you </v>

764
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 3>have a psychedelic experience and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucks your head up,</v>

765
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:34.131
<v Speaker 3>that maybe you're not going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come back and maybe you're going to </v>

766
00:36:34.131 --> 00:36:37.791
<v Speaker 3>go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that's a real possibility and </v>

767
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:40.521
<v Speaker 3>that's something that people need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider before they fuck around with </v>

768
00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:43.791
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a hard time with regular </v>

769
00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:43.791
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

770
00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:47.901
<v Speaker 3>don't go doing any drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you want to try that </v>

771
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 3>shamonic breathing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to work your way up to that.</v>

772
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't just take acid,</v>

773
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you take acid it will last </v>

774
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.240
<v Speaker 3>like a long time and if you're freaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

775
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.570
<v Speaker 3>like part of psychedelic experiences are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to just let go and it's very</v>

776
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:08.481
<v Speaker 3>hard for people to do and one of the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>things when you hear people talk about </v>

777
00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 3>like bad trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>

778
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.480
<v Speaker 3>one of the big issues is people letting </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and letting the experience take them </v>

779
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:20.241
<v Speaker 3>there because you will try to resist it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the first things that any</v>

780
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:25.251
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience exposes is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own flaws and inadequacies and a lot of </v>

781
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:26.780
<v Speaker 3>people</v>

782
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.670
<v Speaker 4>do not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

783
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Bob Marley that said it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the mirror that reveals you to </v>

784
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:32.770
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

785
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

786
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.550
<v Speaker 4>because you're creating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're creating an image that isn't </v>

787
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.981
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Image you want to project is not what's </v>

788
00:37:41.981 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 4>going to appear to you in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you've done something like this,</v>

789
00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:43.790
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have to be a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

790
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.880
<v Speaker 4>A flotation tank can get you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>

791
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.680
<v Speaker 4>if done correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can get you there,</v>

792
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:53.710
<v Speaker 4>but the psychedelic experience goes with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth mover and it just takes tons </v>

793
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:59.201
<v Speaker 4>of dirt off of the path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you see the mirror way quicker to </v>

794
00:37:59.201 --> 00:37:59.690
<v Speaker 4>bunker buster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is exactly.</v>

795
00:37:59.691 --> 00:38:04.691
<v Speaker 4>It's just gets right down through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fucks you up all your mountain of </v>

796
00:38:04.691 --> 00:38:04.691
<v Speaker 4>bullshit that you've covered yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>with</v>

797
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:10.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think leads to a lot of </v>

798
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.881
<v Speaker 3>bad trips for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you also have to consider brain </v>

799
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:13.881
<v Speaker 3>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

800
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that need </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

801
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.400
<v Speaker 3>There's some people where their brain's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not working so well.</v>

802
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.730
<v Speaker 3>And if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't stack mushrooms on top of </v>

803
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that's probably not the</v>

804
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 3>best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's important.</v>

805
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:30.561
<v Speaker 3>Whenever we talk about psycho dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the good aspects of </v>

806
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:30.561
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you hear about like,</v>

807
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>that dude from pink floyd that lost his </v>
<v Speaker 3>marbles,</v>

808
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:32.740
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

809
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 4>especially with the synthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

810
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you'd that seemingly acid and some other</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

811
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

812
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.980
<v Speaker 4>some of the other different Kenneth </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chemical Monikers,</v>

813
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:45.870
<v Speaker 4>like a Dr Sasha shogun would create and </v>
<v Speaker 4>his lab or something like that.</v>

814
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Seems fine though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is fine now,</v>

815
00:38:47.631 --> 00:38:51.110
<v Speaker 4>but he has the right attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think with the right attitude of the,</v>

816
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 4>the key is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to witness and allow.</v>

817
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.380
<v Speaker 4>You got to be the person in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>theater,</v>

818
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 4>eating popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching what's happening,</v>

819
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of subjectively or objectively.</v>

820
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

821
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

822
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes eating my organs.</v>

823
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

824
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going down a vine,</v>

825
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:09.220
<v Speaker 4>the thorns and having my genitals </v>
<v Speaker 4>eviscerated.</v>

826
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's unpleasant.</v>

827
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:15.271
<v Speaker 4>But no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the attitude you have to take </v>

828
00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 4>during those horrible things regardless </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what it is.</v>

829
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.440
<v Speaker 4>Because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you try to fight it,</v>

830
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 4>it's going to win.</v>

831
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's so easy to develop a strong ego</v>

832
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 4>got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're a man,</v>

833
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:28.770
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy to take yourself seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you've got some </v>

834
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.771
<v Speaker 4>accomplishments under your belt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're working hard every day and you </v>

835
00:39:31.771 --> 00:39:31.771
<v Speaker 4>just start thinking you're something </v>
<v Speaker 4>special,</v>

836
00:39:31.771 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really can confuse the fuck out of </v>

837
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.431
<v Speaker 4>yourself and then one of those ego </v>
<v Speaker 4>obliterating experiences comes along and</v>

838
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 4>just exposes you to yourself or what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really are and you're like,</v>

839
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>

840
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 4>But I almost always feel when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like wow,</v>

841
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:50.230
<v Speaker 4>I needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

842
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.750
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much feel so much lighter.</v>

843
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Better now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get along quicker now.</v>

844
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

845
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I think going back to the archives of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

846
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 4>I remember one particularly difficult </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

847
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 4>One of the most challenging I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've had A.</v>

848
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 4>I've talked a lot about snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiders exploding and all of that.</v>

849
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 4>I've always taken with a grain of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one that was the most,</v>

850
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 4>most challenging experience I've had was</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a vision of hell,</v>

851
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:22.650
<v Speaker 4>where I felt completely out of any realm</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there was life.</v>

852
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Like there was not a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was not a tree,</v>

853
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.090
<v Speaker 4>there was not another living thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere around and it was the deepest,</v>

854
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 4>loneliest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most isolated feeling I've ever felt.</v>

855
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.690
<v Speaker 4>And that to me actually calibrated what </v>
<v Speaker 4>my experience of hell ever was,</v>

856
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 4>is hell is not in these places with </v>
<v Speaker 4>demons and fire.</v>

857
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:48.181
<v Speaker 4>There's all life force there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the energy of creation and </v>

858
00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:48.820
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell is being on the other side of space</v>

859
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 4>where there is no life where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>source where there's no nothing there.</v>

860
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a spider,</v>

861
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:58.660
<v Speaker 4>anything would have been a salvation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this place that I was,</v>

862
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.900
<v Speaker 4>that I was appearing at and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself at that point trying to fight it </v>

863
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:03.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck,</v>

864
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.150
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

865
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Make some butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>appear something,</v>

866
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:07.330
<v Speaker 4>please happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A color,</v>

867
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:12.331
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was just drab and dead and I </v>

868
00:41:12.331 --> 00:41:13.360
<v Speaker 4>was totally alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that experience there,</v>

869
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

870
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.160
<v Speaker 4>if I hadn't been well versed in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in what you know,</v>

871
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 4>in this realm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the other side,</v>

872
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:25.981
<v Speaker 4>then it could have been a really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could have been an experience that </v>

873
00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:25.981
<v Speaker 4>stuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

874
00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:30.721
<v Speaker 4>It could have been something that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't allow to happen and I fought and </v>

875
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.721
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if I would have stood up and tried </v>

876
00:41:33.721 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 4>to change my scenery and touch my face </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

877
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

878
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

879
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm still in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not actually dealt with that and not</v>

880
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.480
<v Speaker 2>seen it all the way through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the feeling like that would have </v>

881
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:43.480
<v Speaker 2>been something that would have stuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

882
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 2>So psychedelics are not to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightly.</v>

883
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to take the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>

884
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Find someone who's experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

885
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:52.080
<v Speaker 2>do something like holotropic breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 2>do something like an isolate all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trophic holotropic,</v>

887
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 2>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germantic.</v>

888
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to an isolation tank.</v>

889
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we try a little weed,</v>

890
00:41:59.521 --> 00:42:01.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you're cool with,</v>

891
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 2>with like the baby steps before you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go whole hog.</v>

892
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 2>And if you do go whole hog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said for that.</v>

893
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Just diving in the cold swimming pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>without dipping your toe in.</v>

894
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you're with someone who's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their game and really on point and </v>

895
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 2>can guide you through.</v>

896
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And you can look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most important things is to </v>

897
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:21.280
<v Speaker 2>look at them and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

898
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

899
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.240
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you just need it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

900
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:23.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>

901
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

902
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't accidentally poison myself </v>

903
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 2>because your brain will tell you if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it alone and you get to a </v>

904
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 2>bad place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to say,</v>

905
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I think you might've just boys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

906
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't mind it.</v>

907
00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Just boys and yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't want that voice.</v>

908
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it feels like mean.</v>

909
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Do DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like there's no way I'm coming </v>

910
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:44.740
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up,</v>

911
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.760
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

912
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I crossed into the great beyond to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a peek and they're going to let me back.</v>

913
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad that from what we know </v>

914
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 2>about the positive benefits of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these substances,</v>

915
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 2>that we are forced to do it this way.</v>

916
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.850
<v Speaker 2>We're forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were under the illusion that we live </v>

917
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.450
<v Speaker 2>in a free society because it's freer </v>
<v Speaker 2>than most societies,</v>

918
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not a free society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human race has yet to conceive of an</v>

919
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:18.341
<v Speaker 2>execute a free society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist as far especially a </v>

920
00:43:18.341 --> 00:43:19.910
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>educated,</v>

921
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.940
<v Speaker 2>aware society that is not beholden to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil corporations.</v>

922
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.160
<v Speaker 2>We haven't figured that out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really haven't,</v>

923
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we make movies about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Avatar and they become wildly </v>

924
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

925
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the closest we can come to is our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own imaginations.</v>

926
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.300
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

927
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:40.020
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

928
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:45.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to cert have a </v>

929
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.341
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of Yang in order to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of yen and it's almost </v>

930
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:52.091
<v Speaker 2>like this sort of evil against good is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the human being needs to sort </v>

931
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 2>of propel society forward.</v>

932
00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Constant struggle and conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which creates momentum.</v>

933
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be that a lot of people </v>

934
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 2>are lazy as fuck and if they lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise,</v>

935
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.170
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't get laptops made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

936
00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.030
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you need some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

937
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 2>it all has to be difficult for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push further,</v>

938
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's enough difficulty in our own</v>

939
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:22.331
<v Speaker 2>minds just getting within ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding happiness and self love and </v>

940
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>actualization is a fucking battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

941
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:31.030
<v Speaker 2>so to say that we need this external </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit just to allow us to do that is not </v>

942
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always gonna be a struggle.</v>

943
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying</v>

944
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 3>that we need you and I certainly don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need it,</v>

945
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.160
<v Speaker 3>but society as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I looked at the human race as a </v>

946
00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.731
<v Speaker 3>mathematical computation and I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of energy that's been </v>

947
00:44:43.731 --> 00:44:47.180
<v Speaker 3>expressed and the amount of effort </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been expressed and a little,</v>

948
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 3>why are they spending so much energy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they're spending so much effort?</v>

949
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it because it's trying to </v>

950
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 3>conquer the world junior because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to expose.</v>

951
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:58.400
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to enforce the ape </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology on this ever changing </v>

952
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Speaker 3>technological world they live and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're expressing themselves in </v>

953
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 3>these 16 hour work days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really that simple.</v>

954
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they in debt?</v>

955
00:45:06.391 --> 00:45:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Why they owe so much money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they,</v>

956
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:13.011
<v Speaker 3>why do they work more than their health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's them like what do they do in </v>

957
00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:13.011
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

958
00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 3>they have to because they owe money.</v>

959
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Credit cards because they had to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking electronics that they need to </v>

960
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.001
<v Speaker 3>keep the machine alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you looked at a completely </v>

961
00:45:23.001 --> 00:45:25.080
<v Speaker 3>objective outside of being a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of being a cog in this wheel and</v>

962
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 3>you looked at it from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 3>an objective distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd would say,</v>

964
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:33.591
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see they're fucking building towards </v>

965
00:45:33.591 --> 00:45:35.661
<v Speaker 3>something and they're there in a fury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in a frenzy to the point where </v>

966
00:45:35.661 --> 00:45:39.381
<v Speaker 3>they give up their own health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness in order to perpetuate this </v>

967
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:44.211
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're either building something over </v>

968
00:45:44.211 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 3>there at the height of madness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

969
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:50.150
<v Speaker 3>to a certain degree and could be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this height of madness.</v>

970
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.190
<v Speaker 3>The whole reason why it coexists with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this incredible,</v>

971
00:45:55.381 --> 00:46:00.381
<v Speaker 3>restrict him restriction on psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and restriction on the public's access </v>

972
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.050
<v Speaker 3>to psychedelics that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They coexist because without one you </v>

973
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 3>could not have the other.</v>

974
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 3>If if psychedelics were not illegal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult to come by,</v>

975
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:17.151
<v Speaker 3>we would not live in the same world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would be connected with the whole </v>

976
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would realize that we are all.</v>

977
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.760
<v Speaker 3>We are completely necessary to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and that that vision that you had </v>

978
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.661
<v Speaker 3>of ultimate space and silence and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>color and drabness and being being </v>

979
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:32.241
<v Speaker 3>hellacious because even though we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these instincts in this ego that wants </v>

980
00:46:32.241 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 3>us to go out there and make our name for</v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>

981
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 3>the reality is you are not shit without </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

982
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 3>You cannot you if you're alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for breaks.</v>

983
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:47.570
<v Speaker 3>We take breaks and you breathe and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get something to eat and watch tv by </v>

984
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was nice,</v>

985
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but you better get back to the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon because if you don't,</v>

986
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I don't.</v>

987
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Some days I don't eat.</v>

988
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I take a day off eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I feel like taking a day off,</v>

989
00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:56.480
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good for you,</v>

990
00:46:56.481 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>but I don't take more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I don't take a month off.</v>

991
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.120
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not good and a staple of </v>

992
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.160
<v Speaker 3>being a human being is human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to interact with human beings.</v>

993
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.880
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

994
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 3>we're most certainly a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

995
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this process being run in a conscious</v>

996
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:21.111
<v Speaker 3>manner or is it being run and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctive manner that's been hijacked </v>

997
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.960
<v Speaker 3>because the very instincts that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we're sort of regulated by </v>

998
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic compounds throughout our </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

999
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.960
<v Speaker 3>and we removed those compounds from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equation which accelerates the madness </v>

1000
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.641
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the human without the bio </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical and botanical sort of mediating</v>

1001
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 3>age that's unbalanced.</v>

1002
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.510
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of things had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>hijacked.</v>

1003
00:47:44.511 --> 00:47:47.270
<v Speaker 4>I think religion has been one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>main things that has been hijacked.</v>

1004
00:47:47.271 --> 00:47:51.050
<v Speaker 4>It is taken our desire to connect with </v>
<v Speaker 4>source,</v>

1005
00:47:51.051 --> 00:47:52.160
<v Speaker 4>with life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with God.</v>

1006
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:54.050
<v Speaker 4>If your vocabulary permits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1007
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a big vocab issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing,</v>

1008
00:47:56.451 --> 00:48:01.451
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that force that creates life within all </v>

1009
00:48:01.451 --> 00:48:01.451
<v Speaker 4>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call it God,</v>

1010
00:48:01.451 --> 00:48:03.530
<v Speaker 4>call it whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is a natural inclination that,</v>

1011
00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:05.660
<v Speaker 4>drawing towards that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a,</v>

1012
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.500
<v Speaker 4>there's an old myth between,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1013
00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:10.160
<v Speaker 4>a Hindu myth and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1014
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Brahma and Maya were the only two forces</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there in the universe and they were </v>

1015
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.850
<v Speaker 4>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so mine.</v>

1016
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:16.310
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1017
00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:18.020
<v Speaker 4>we're going to create a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a female,</v>

1018
00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:23.021
<v Speaker 4>Brahma is the male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad would not let any of them have sex </v>

1019
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:26.021
<v Speaker 4>at that point anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she says we're going to have a game </v>

1020
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:26.021
<v Speaker 4>and the and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1021
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:26.021
<v Speaker 4>we'll do that.</v>

1022
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:28.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like first you create the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brahma creates the world.</v>

1023
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Then after Brahma creates the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she says,</v>

1024
00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:35.681
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you have to create someone who can </v>

1025
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:35.681
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the world and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1026
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:39.911
<v Speaker 4>so he creates humans and then at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point she cuts them up into all tiny </v>

1027
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:43.580
<v Speaker 4>little tiny pieces and he puts a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece in each human and says,</v>

1028
00:48:43.581 --> 00:48:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Brahma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the game begins.</v>

1029
00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 4>The game is you are going to all think </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're different and you're going to </v>

1030
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.130
<v Speaker 4>have to find your way back to figuring </v>
<v Speaker 4>out who you are and so that,</v>

1031
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:57.310
<v Speaker 4>that idea that we're all like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of something still just trying to </v>

1032
00:48:57.471 --> 00:48:59.900
<v Speaker 4>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That instinct,</v>

1033
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:01.310
<v Speaker 4>that impetus to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1034
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.760
<v Speaker 4>to find what we are at the very core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you remove the body,</v>

1035
00:49:04.761 --> 00:49:08.150
<v Speaker 4>remove the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back to the soul and even remove the</v>

1036
00:49:08.151 --> 00:49:08.690
<v Speaker 4>soul.</v>

1037
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 4>So you're just that piece of life force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that desire to figure out what </v>

1038
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.670
<v Speaker 4>that is has been jacked just jacked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

1039
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judaism,</v>

1040
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.800
<v Speaker 4>which had as a sentiment of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a kernel of goodness and wisdom.</v>

1041
00:49:21.801 --> 00:49:23.570
<v Speaker 4>All of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Islam included,</v>

1042
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.120
<v Speaker 4>everything has this kernel of wisdom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

1043
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.430
<v Speaker 4>but then it gets hijacked by people for </v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

1044
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:29.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have been frustrated,</v>

1045
00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:34.901
<v Speaker 4>people who are sadistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who want to control other people </v>

1046
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:34.901
<v Speaker 4>want the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>want the sex.</v>

1047
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:37.130
<v Speaker 4>They're like the Tony Montana in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking priest robe,</v>

1048
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they jack this stuff leaders to control </v>

1049
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.490
<v Speaker 4>the people and and it's created this </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive imbalance.</v>

1050
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it's maybe not created it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it certainly accelerated it and then</v>

1051
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 4>of course the forces of greed that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been kind of a inculcated by general </v>

1052
00:49:53.901 --> 00:49:58.340
<v Speaker 4>society and this feeling that you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>more things and in all of this,</v>

1053
00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.970
<v Speaker 4>this is all just fueled to create really</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive imbalance.</v>

1054
00:50:01.971 --> 00:50:04.610
<v Speaker 4>In my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It did need to be this massive,</v>

1055
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 4>but there is going to be a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>correction.</v>

1056
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I just hope we don't go too far back the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other way because there is a need for </v>

1057
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.010
<v Speaker 4>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a need for,</v>

1058
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1059
00:50:14.151 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 4>strength and capitalism and many of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideals that we actually do pretty well.</v>

1060
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1061
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.640
<v Speaker 4>if you go all the way completely back </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side,</v>

1062
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.820
<v Speaker 4>which is a little bit probably why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement in the sixties and seventies </v>

1063
00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was too loose,</v>

1064
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 3>didn't have enough structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have enough of the,</v>

1065
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:34.990
<v Speaker 3>the Yang part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just went to yen.</v>

1067
00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:39.991
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with creating these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalances as the pendulum swing gets </v>

1068
00:50:39.991 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 3>too broad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1070
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a really good point,</v>

1071
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:46.090
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pendulum swing and it's,</v>

1072
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating how every time a person</v>

1073
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:54.761
<v Speaker 3>gets into a position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a corruption and,</v>

1074
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deviation from the original intent and</v>

1075
00:50:58.641 --> 00:51:03.641
<v Speaker 3>it becomes this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of dominance issue.</v>

1076
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Like even with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama has.</v>

1077
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came from,</v>

1078
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 3>if you look at his past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came from a single mother,</v>

1079
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's mixed race.</v>

1080
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 3>You look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1081
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy should understand the plight of</v>

1082
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 3>the common folk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy should be,</v>

1083
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who represents us because he </v>

1084
00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 3>grew up Kinda poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1085
00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:26.921
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a rich kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he gets into office and he's </v>

1086
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:30.581
<v Speaker 3>been the one guy who's attacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>whistleblowers more than any president </v>

1087
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:31.940
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1088
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 3>He's gone after the press more than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>president before.</v>

1089
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 3>They've dropped more bombs from drones </v>
<v Speaker 3>than any president before.</v>

1090
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 3>So was he for his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a lack of privacy.</v>

1091
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:46.810
<v Speaker 3>He's for infringement on your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's for restricting constitutional </v>

1092
00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.550
<v Speaker 3>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's for changing constitutional and uh,</v>

1093
00:51:50.551 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1094
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:56.471
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amendments that have given us freedoms </v>

1095
00:51:56.471 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 3>in this country and restricting them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep you safe.</v>

1096
00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 3>All the shit that we've been warned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about by like our founding fathers,</v>

1097
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:05.650
<v Speaker 3>he who would take freed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he who would take safety over liberty </v>

1098
00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 3>deserves neither.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1099
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:11.081
<v Speaker 3>that's like an old school saying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that they're going to take </v>

1100
00:52:11.081 --> 00:52:14.801
<v Speaker 3>liberty away from you to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drones and it's fucking Obama </v>

1101
00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Obama's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that guy that got into Egypt </v>

1102
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

1103
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:20.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Egypt throughout that,</v>

1104
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.030
<v Speaker 3>that asshole dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as this new guy gets in,</v>

1105
00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:28.031
<v Speaker 3>he tries to pass all these laws to turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself into a dictator and you're like </v>

1106
00:52:28.031 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and this riots in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street like,</v>

1107
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did we fight for?</v>

1108
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 3>What is going on and what is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly is executive privilege?</v>

1109
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:42.190
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean you don't have to tell us that </v>

1110
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:46.571
<v Speaker 3>you knew about some crazy program where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they sold guns to Mexican drug lords.</v>

1111
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of guns and those guns were </v>
<v Speaker 3>used on Americans,</v>

1112
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:54.200
<v Speaker 3>civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American citizens.</v>

1113
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:56.960
<v Speaker 3>So the border patrol agent was murdered </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one of those guns.</v>

1114
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:59.930
<v Speaker 3>This operation fast and furious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama says,</v>

1115
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:04.931
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to take executive </v>

1116
00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:06.191
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really have to talk about that </v>

1117
00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:08.650
<v Speaker 3>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying he's guilty and I'm </v>

1118
00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 3>not saying that as a president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could possibly be aware of everything</v>

1119
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 3>that's going on because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

1120
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.700
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that we have some creepy </v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of jail free pass because that </v>

1121
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.391
<v Speaker 3>seems like some shit that might put you </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail for what you would want from </v>

1122
00:53:22.391 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 3>your movie hero president is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1123
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take executive privilege.</v>

1124
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:31.250
<v Speaker 4>The people need to know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was some whack system that we had </v>

1125
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.250
<v Speaker 4>in the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change.</v>

1126
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't do that,</v>

1127
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.850
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in every instance they kind of push </v>

1128
00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 4>things under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just wait for people to get lazy,</v>

1129
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the president or whether </v>

1130
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.631
<v Speaker 4>it's the UN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just watched a great documentary </v>

1131
00:53:44.631 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 4>called you and me like you for United </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nations.</v>

1132
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1133
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:51.441
<v Speaker 4>it's by this Guy Ami Horowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of the things we're talking </v>

1134
00:53:51.441 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 4>about there in the Rwanda crisis was </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable.</v>

1135
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:57.651
<v Speaker 4>So basically they had the UN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a heavily armed force in the </v>

1136
00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:01.581
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can really regulate shit if they wanted </v>

1137
00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:01.581
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got all the machine guns,</v>

1138
00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:05.151
<v Speaker 4>they got tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got whatever intelligence from </v>

1139
00:54:05.151 --> 00:54:05.151
<v Speaker 4>one of the top kernels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kim's back to the UN and says,</v>

1140
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hutus are about to exterminate the </v>

1141
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Tutsis.</v>

1142
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 4>We have the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have the leaders of the Hutus,</v>

1143
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:18.230
<v Speaker 4>we can take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can take them out now and prevent a </v>

1144
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 4>mass genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was like a week in advance,</v>

1145
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.360
<v Speaker 4>sending the cable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>send it.</v>

1146
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we do this?</v>

1147
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Can we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we stop this genocide please?</v>

1148
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:28.370
<v Speaker 4>These are the leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're are going to get this message </v>

1149
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.370
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we stop?</v>

1150
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Can we stop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1151
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.810
<v Speaker 4>No answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No a better stay impartial.</v>

1152
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Better stay impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1153
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 4>what happens exactly what the colonel </v>
<v Speaker 4>said happens.</v>

1154
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 4>The Hutus go in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get their hammers,</v>

1155
00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 4>they get their machetes and they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>run riot.</v>

1156
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 4>Everybody with a tootsie identification </v>
<v Speaker 4>card,</v>

1157
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 4>whacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1158
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 4>So eventually all of the Tutsis gather </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the UN,</v>

1159
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:49.551
<v Speaker 4>puts up a flag and this school posts the</v>
<v Speaker 4>perimeter and there's hundreds and </v>

1160
00:54:49.551 --> 00:54:51.600
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of of Tutsis that have gathered</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

1161
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.780
<v Speaker 4>in this building and they're safe for </v>
<v Speaker 4>temporarily as the UN is there </v>

1162
00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:56.790
<v Speaker 4>protecting them.</v>

1163
00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:01.970
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Hutus go around and they start </v>

1164
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 4>drinking and they have their bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammers fresh on their,</v>

1165
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.790
<v Speaker 4>their kinsmen blood out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just drinking in Taunton and </v>

1166
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 4>hanging out outside the perimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The UN says,</v>

1167
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:09.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>

1168
00:55:09.511 --> 00:55:14.511
<v Speaker 4>What do we got to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the message comes back in from the </v>

1169
00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:14.511
<v Speaker 4>UN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evacuate the premises,</v>

1170
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 4>evacuated the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

1171
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 4>if we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 500 people that are going to get</v>

1172
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 4>killed with hammers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You realize that.</v>

1173
00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1174
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 4>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't take sides.</v>

1175
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Evacuate the premises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as they're evacuating the premises,</v>

1176
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:28.620
<v Speaker 4>you see this footage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like hanging on.</v>

1177
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.010
<v Speaker 4>They're hanging onto the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please take me there asking them,</v>

1178
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.100
<v Speaker 4>shoot me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please shoot me so I don't have to deal </v>

1179
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.580
<v Speaker 4>with what the people with the hammers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the machetes and the rape that's </v>

1180
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:40.580
<v Speaker 4>going to happen.</v>

1181
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.790
<v Speaker 4>If you evacuate us and you leave us </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1182
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 4>what happens to soldiers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beat them off with the end of their guns</v>

1183
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 4>crews out and exactly that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They roll into the school mass murder,</v>

1184
00:55:50.221 --> 00:55:55.140
<v Speaker 4>mass genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't we more upset about that?</v>

1185
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 4>That is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell is the UN doing if they're</v>

1186
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:02.370
<v Speaker 4>not there to protect those people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that circumstance,</v>

1187
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's just an example of,</v>

1188
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:09.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we pick on our own government all the </v>

1189
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:09.850
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure we have some certain involvement in</v>

1190
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.701
<v Speaker 4>the UN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the UN doesn't seem any better and </v>

1191
00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:13.701
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1192
00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 4>probably hardly any other government is </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1193
00:56:15.511 --> 00:56:17.760
<v Speaker 4>We're just more active.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somehow.</v>

1194
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:23.060
<v Speaker 4>This system that has created people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>power has created a morality where all </v>

1195
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>they care</v>

1196
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.610
<v Speaker 3>about is power and money and that's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change.</v>

1197
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 3>And how do you get that to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>without enlightening people?</v>

1198
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 3>And how do you enlightened people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can't get them to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathe,</v>

1200
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.070
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

1201
00:56:37.071 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 3>and we'll get you to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shamonic breathing.</v>

1202
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Everybody sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to force them to do Shimano </v>

1203
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:44.370
<v Speaker 3>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need the,</v>

1204
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:48.091
<v Speaker 3>they need the bunker busters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating situation because we </v>

1205
00:56:48.091 --> 00:56:52.620
<v Speaker 3>are in this really odd time where we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn so much and there's so much </v>

1206
00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:56.050
<v Speaker 3>information available almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously,</v>

1207
00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:01.350
<v Speaker 3>but yet we still are struggling with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these crazy ape dominance instincts and </v>

1208
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:06.271
<v Speaker 3>these eight dominance instincts sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>get subverted in these large </v>

1209
00:57:06.271 --> 00:57:10.110
<v Speaker 3>civilization contexts of one person or </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple people controlling millions and</v>

1210
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:16.651
<v Speaker 3>having to keep a lid on this bubbling </v>
<v Speaker 3>cauldron of humanity that you can call a</v>

1211
00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 3>country and they almost all do the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1212
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.570
<v Speaker 3>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking power grab.</v>

1213
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 3>They try to protect themselves as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>as possible.</v>

1214
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 3>They tried to take away your rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially you're right to go after </v>

1215
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right to defend yourself.</v>

1216
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.441
<v Speaker 3>They want to take away your guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to take away anything that </v>

1217
00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:37.051
<v Speaker 3>makes you crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to take anything that's going </v>

1218
00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:39.451
<v Speaker 3>to empower you and and somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another take away from their ability to </v>

1219
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:41.650
<v Speaker 3>control you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1220
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.460
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1221
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Society really wants to give people </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal access to information.</v>

1222
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.880
<v Speaker 3>No society really wanted the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fucked up and it would.</v>

1223
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.920
<v Speaker 3>It sort of snuck up on them and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stuck in the situation where </v>

1224
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:58.441
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to regulate and trying to</v>

1225
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 3>sort of govern people the way they did </v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1226
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.960
<v Speaker 3>four decades ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a blink of an eye in terms of </v>

1227
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.220
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of this society,</v>

1228
00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a million years ago because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

1229
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 3>so it looks so woefully inadequate </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1230
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 3>It looks so clumsy and it's so obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

1231
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I would say that this civil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this culture that's growing up right </v>

1232
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.931
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this generation knows more about the </v>

1233
00:58:27.931 --> 00:58:31.561
<v Speaker 3>fact that our government is corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's corrupt more than any </v>

1234
00:58:31.561 --> 00:58:31.870
<v Speaker 3>generation before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1235
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Like by a long stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long shot.</v>

1236
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 3>There's things that we know about today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1237
00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 3>when Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even things that were in the news,</v>

1238
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 3>like the Iran Contra affair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember that was when I was in</v>

1239
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 3>my early twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seen Oliver North on TV and trying to</v>

1240
00:58:47.321 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 3>piece this together and trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1241
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1242
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1243
00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you guys do?</v>

1244
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.680
<v Speaker 3>The visa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys sold arms to Iran.</v>

1245
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1246
00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:00.920
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you did what you,</v>

1247
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 3>the contras and the Sandinistas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>

1248
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:08.730
<v Speaker 3>You so coke in the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys sold coke to pay for guns.</v>

1249
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of government are we run </v>

1250
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:14.100
<v Speaker 3>in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1251
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1252
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go back to your question,</v>

1253
00:59:16.361 --> 00:59:17.590
<v Speaker 3>how do we fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1254
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I think the only way is we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create a pandemic,</v>

1255
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 3>an</v>

1256
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 4>epidemic like influenza used to be or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the black plague used to be,</v>

1257
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 4>but on the good side of pandemic of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

1258
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.580
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about your show here is that </v>

1259
00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:38.020
<v Speaker 4>we're creating a bit of that momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're catching people and then these </v>

1260
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.150
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're contagious,</v>

1261
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why you call it spreading virally</v>

1262
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 4>the whole term from the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be like a virus,</v>

1263
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:44.780
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

1264
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 4>awareness can spread and we're all an </v>
<v Speaker 4>active part of spreading that.</v>

1265
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Each person that we bring in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1266
00:59:51.531 --> 00:59:52.600
<v Speaker 4>have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1267
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:57.610
<v Speaker 4>I remember one of the things I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know I showed a video about nda is </v>

1268
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.620
<v Speaker 4>just for an example that indefinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>detention to somebody who was mild,</v>

1269
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a national defense authorization act,</v>

1270
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>which is a really scary act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been passed recently,</v>

1271
01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>which has all sorts of things in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that eviscerate the bill of rights.</v>

1272
01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:15.361
<v Speaker 1>One of them is indefinite detention </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can take someone who's an </v>

1273
01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:18.451
<v Speaker 1>American citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they suspect them something and </v>

1274
01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>they can just attain them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to have a lawyer,</v>

1275
01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have any rights,</v>

1276
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any rights anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically just like the king </v>

1277
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>throwing you in the dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1278
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And this is real shit that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians have passed.</v>

1279
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>We've been hijacked</v>

1280
01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.140
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I showed this video to someone who is</v>

1281
01:00:31.141 --> 01:00:33.120
<v Speaker 4>mildly pro Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not crazy,</v>

1282
01:00:33.121 --> 01:00:38.121
<v Speaker 4>really kind of APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Took herself out of the old political </v>

1283
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:38.121
<v Speaker 4>picture and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1284
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:41.160
<v Speaker 4>this is a bill that he allowed to pass </v>
<v Speaker 4>and showed her all the details about it.</v>

1285
01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Basically it was a video describing </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you said and,</v>

1286
01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:46.360
<v Speaker 4>and going through it in about a two </v>
<v Speaker 4>minute video,</v>

1287
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.670
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1288
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.470
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1289
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at that moment you could see there </v>

1290
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:54.730
<v Speaker 4>was a shift there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1291
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:57.120
<v Speaker 4>she understood something that wasn't she</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't aware of.</v>

1292
01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.580
<v Speaker 4>And every time that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1293
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.280
<v Speaker 4>we make those little marks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts to spread virally.</v>

1294
01:01:02.281 --> 01:01:07.281
<v Speaker 4>And at certain point I believe that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will get to a critical mass where the </v>

1295
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:09.840
<v Speaker 4>people just will no longer tolerate it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and will be the majority.</v>

1296
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:13.200
<v Speaker 4>And at that point we'll have to clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and they're gonna clean.</v>

1297
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old power structure is going to </v>

1298
01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.731
<v Speaker 4>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to come up with some </v>

1299
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:19.731
<v Speaker 4>really crazy fucked up rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think at the height of it,</v>

1300
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:21.720
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>

1301
01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that's going to be,</v>

1302
01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:29.301
<v Speaker 4>but it's gonna get really nasty when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement of consciousness runs square </v>

1303
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:34.170
<v Speaker 4>against the kind of Reptilian power grab</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the old structure.</v>

1304
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to be a trying time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think they'll die off or they'll </v>

1305
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.530
<v Speaker 4>die off smoothly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull in their place that's possible.</v>

1306
01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully that's the best case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best.</v>

1307
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.910
<v Speaker 4>That's the way we want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way want it</v>

1308
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>to be is that the young people coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1309
01:01:46.951 --> 01:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are in college right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are listening to this,</v>

1310
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>when they're riding their bike to school</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1311
01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are gonna be responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for running this fucking crazy machine </v>

1312
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1313
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>if the whole world is aware what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going on,</v>

1314
01:01:59.701 --> 01:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it's harder and harder to fuck people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just harder.</v>

1315
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think right now they're still able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lock down enough that they can </v>

1316
01:02:08.011 --> 01:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>operate in the old way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see things like the,</v>

1317
01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the NSA's idea of building this we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abby Martin and um,</v>

1318
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name was the other gal?</v>

1319
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Well David Seaman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was his thing as well.</v>

1320
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.700
<v Speaker 3>We had him on and he was explaining to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us what,</v>

1321
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:30.740
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to do that there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're building this gigantic compound </v>

1322
01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:35.601
<v Speaker 3>in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which essentially copies every email </v>

1323
01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:38.631
<v Speaker 3>that every American citizen makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every phone call that you make is </v>

1324
01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 3>recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every picture that you text someone,</v>

1325
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.920
<v Speaker 3>so all your Dick Pics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those are going to be recording so </v>

1326
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.140
<v Speaker 3>that if they ever have anything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to bring out an Abra.</v>

1327
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1328
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Florida and did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1329
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:56.140
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you fucking burn the American flag?</v>

1330
01:02:56.141 --> 01:02:57.640
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

1331
01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:02.641
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we have here your emails that say </v>

1332
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 3>that you were on your way to Florida </v>
<v Speaker 3>burn the flag.</v>

1333
01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:07.761
<v Speaker 3>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a flag he bought at Walmart </v>

1334
01:03:07.761 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 3>because we traced your credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have here.</v>

1335
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 3>You know the phone calls he made </v>
<v Speaker 3>bragging about it.</v>

1336
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 3>You want us to play them back for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1337
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.940
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you realize like,</v>

1338
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.060
<v Speaker 3>my whole life is being recorded and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every email I make I have to assume now </v>

1339
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:22.890
<v Speaker 3>that someone's listening and reading my </v>
<v Speaker 3>emails,</v>

1340
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 3>listening to my phone calls and reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>my emails.</v>

1341
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Who are these people and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they get elected,</v>

1342
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 3>do they even get elected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1343
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:36.171
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get elected to just get hired so </v>

1344
01:03:36.171 --> 01:03:37.860
<v Speaker 3>you get hired so you get hired and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to be the one who decides whether or</v>

1345
01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:40.090
<v Speaker 3>not they can look at your Dick Pics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

1346
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a world we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in where some small group of people have</v>

1347
01:03:44.011 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 3>that kind of power with the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1348
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 3>If someone hacks into your email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are those people can go to jail.</v>

1349
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a regular person,</v>

1350
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.870
<v Speaker 3>some if Brian gets nutty and he decides </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hack into some girl's email and </v>

1351
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 3>starts reading her emails that she could</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out about that and she could have </v>

1352
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.220
<v Speaker 3>him arrested and he can go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do like cyber terrorism.</v>

1353
01:04:05.221 --> 01:04:10.221
<v Speaker 3>You could do time for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if the NSA says it's okay and that's</v>

1354
01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 3>your Gig and you press that button which</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1355
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:18.360
<v Speaker 3>record all our micro markets as emails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That somehow is okay.</v>

1356
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 3>That that's insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is the height of insanity.</v>

1357
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.620
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about criminals here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1358
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of the United States.</v>

1359
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Wrap your head around that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1360
01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:34.170
<v Speaker 3>innocent until proven guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is they're going to record all </v>

1362
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:39.260
<v Speaker 3>of your shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't worry,</v>

1363
01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.560
<v Speaker 3>they won't send your Dick pics out as </v>
<v Speaker 3>long as you keep it.</v>

1364
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine a scenario where what makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>this particularly vial is the fact that </v>

1365
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.940
<v Speaker 4>there's so many unjust laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1366
01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:55.920
<v Speaker 4>if every law was perfectly just and </v>
<v Speaker 4>based upon harming somebody else,</v>

1367
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.650
<v Speaker 4>then it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1368
01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.130
<v Speaker 4>what are they going to fucking catch me </v>
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>

1369
01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:04.131
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's going to be like the only </v>

1370
01:05:04.131 --> 01:05:04.620
<v Speaker 4>people who would get caught with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>murderers,</v>

1371
01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 4>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like that.</v>

1372
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.820
<v Speaker 4>But because there's so many unjust </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit laws like these laws around </v>

1373
01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.930
<v Speaker 4>your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1374
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.120
<v Speaker 4>personal freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whether you want sexual freedoms,</v>

1375
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1376
01:05:16.201 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 4>what you ingest in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of,</v>

1377
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:23.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you want to smoke weed or </v>

1378
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:24.901
<v Speaker 4>whether you wanted whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of these unjust laws give them so </v>

1379
01:05:24.901 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 4>much more leveraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the church saying that,</v>

1380
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>masturbating and sex is a sin.</v>

1381
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a whole bunch of fucking centers</v>

1382
01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 4>then and then once you have sinners then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can manipulate them with guilt,</v>

1383
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:39.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can manipulate them with </v>

1384
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 4>absolution and you can control them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they didn't do that,</v>

1385
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 4>if the church was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1386
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 4>you just have to be a good person and </v>
<v Speaker 4>try your best and you're not a sinner,</v>

1387
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>

1388
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 4>oh sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I qualify.</v>

1389
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.900
<v Speaker 4>So the lighter church and they'll put </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bullshit of the cycle of evil and </v>

1390
01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:56.431
<v Speaker 4>this is where it gets really screwy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a good percentage of our </v>

1391
01:05:56.431 --> 01:06:00.601
<v Speaker 4>prisons that are private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means they're businesses that </v>

1392
01:06:00.601 --> 01:06:00.930
<v Speaker 4>profit fit</v>

1393
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>off of people being in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they and the prison guard unions </v>

1394
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>lobby to make sure that there's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws that they can use to lock you up </v>

1395
01:06:12.691 --> 01:06:17.691
<v Speaker 1>and fill their prisons to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is essentially legalized slavery.</v>

1396
01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of those laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to the drug </v>

1397
01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>laws that absolutely make no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1398
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>They're not based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not based on what we know about </v>

1399
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:34.491
<v Speaker 1>the human body in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like marijuana laws and no </v>

1400
01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.290
<v Speaker 1>ways that based on anything rational in </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way,</v>

1401
01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:42.291
<v Speaker 1>shape or form yet it's still federal law</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can take you and throw you in </v>

1402
01:06:42.841 --> 01:06:47.841
<v Speaker 1>there magic box where you make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and they want to do that and </v>

1403
01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1404
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a very strange thing to be </v>

1405
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>operating like that in 2013 that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are making money off of locking people </v>

1406
01:06:59.581 --> 01:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1407
01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of like the guy in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous story of a gentleman </v>

1408
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:09.231
<v Speaker 1>who was in jail because he had guns as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as medical marijuana and they pass </v>

1409
01:07:10.381 --> 01:07:14.460
<v Speaker 1>some new things saying that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns and you're,</v>

1410
01:07:14.461 --> 01:07:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're involved in marijuana,</v>

1411
01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>it makes it way worse because then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you like a crazy drug dealer.</v>

1412
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:23.301
<v Speaker 1>Like you're one of those Mexican narco </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a hold up in Humboldt with fucking </v>

1413
01:07:23.301 --> 01:07:23.370
<v Speaker 1>machine guns and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>

1414
01:07:23.371 --> 01:07:28.371
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy that was like a hunter who</v>
<v Speaker 1>also decided to run a medical marijuana </v>

1415
01:07:28.371 --> 01:07:31.920
<v Speaker 1>farm because he was trying to make money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thought that it was the law.</v>

1416
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>He had these local politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local cops come over and inspect his </v>

1417
01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.991
<v Speaker 1>plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything looks good and he's </v>

1418
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:44.331
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the list of people that I'm </v>

1419
01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:44.331
<v Speaker 1>selling to these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These plants are all dedicated to them.</v>

1420
01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:44.970
<v Speaker 1>This one goes to this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1421
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>this is their medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1422
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a farmer and I'm going to be able to</v>

1423
01:07:48.601 --> 01:07:50.310
<v Speaker 1>feed my family and make a living doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1424
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Now that you guys up for a possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might lock him up,</v>

1425
01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 80 years.</v>

1426
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1427
01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.610
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>

1428
01:07:56.611 --> 01:07:58.140
<v Speaker 1>For.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because he's shooting?</v>

1429
01:07:58.141 --> 01:07:59.160
<v Speaker 1>People have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1430
01:07:59.161 --> 01:07:59.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1431
01:07:59.431 --> 01:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1432
01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it because he's a felon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not supposed to have guns because </v>

1433
01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:05.340
<v Speaker 1>he's been shown abroad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1434
01:08:05.341 --> 01:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1435
01:08:05.671 --> 01:08:05.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1436
01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1437
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it because he's hurting somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the easy growing something </v>

1438
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that's bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1439
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1440
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:12.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just growing medicine.</v>

1441
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>That's state approved medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can put this guy</v>

1442
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 3>in jail for essentially a non crime </v>
<v Speaker 3>first in the state.</v>

1443
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.160
<v Speaker 3>It's come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything he did is completely legal.</v>

1444
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 3>His use of firearms is recreational and </v>
<v Speaker 3>for hunting purposes,</v>

1445
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:30.790
<v Speaker 3>like this guy's not a narco terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet they can use all these bullshit </v>

1446
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:35.651
<v Speaker 3>laws and arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably confiscated a lot of material </v>

1447
01:08:35.651 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 3>that they took it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always we'd his money too.</v>

1448
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.720
<v Speaker 3>They come in and Jack your money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your weed and what they do in </v>

1449
01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.431
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of cute is because Obama said </v>

1450
01:08:45.431 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 3>that he's not going to target anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who breaks.</v>

1451
01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Only the state law said is if they break</v>
<v Speaker 3>both state and federal law,</v>

1452
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:57.161
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to come after him or </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather not federal offense because it's </v>

1453
01:08:57.161 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 3>all federally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he said if they're,</v>

1454
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.820
<v Speaker 3>if they break the state law as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the federal law than uh,</v>

1455
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 3>then they're open for press is when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>first said when he got into office.</v>

1456
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.260
<v Speaker 3>So this is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how cute they are.</v>

1457
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:11.590
<v Speaker 3>So they don't really put you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the times what they do is they </v>

1458
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:13.430
<v Speaker 3>arrest you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they open up the place,</v>

1459
01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 3>they come in with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they scare the fuck out anybody,</v>

1460
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.590
<v Speaker 3>they take all of your weed and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>take all your money.</v>

1461
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 3>They take everybody's information down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do nothing,</v>

1462
01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:27.360
<v Speaker 3>so it's the jacket jacket that's a jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so instead of arresting you and </v>

1463
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 3>prosecuting you and putting you in jail </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of doing that,</v>

1464
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:35.360
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing more often is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking all your shit and then saying the</v>

1465
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:40.361
<v Speaker 3>case is open and they never do anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because they really don't have </v>

1466
01:09:40.361 --> 01:09:41.150
<v Speaker 3>the resources to prosecuting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>cases.</v>

1467
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:46.151
<v Speaker 3>They really don't have resources to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after all these guys that are running </v>

1468
01:09:46.151 --> 01:09:49.001
<v Speaker 3>these medical marijuana shops because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's twice as many of them as there </v>

1469
01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:49.001
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1470
01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:49.001
<v Speaker 3>Starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1471
01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the numbers of medical marijuana clinics</v>

1472
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:53.900
<v Speaker 3>in southern California is somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thousands.</v>

1473
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispensaries rather.</v>

1474
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:58.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know how many they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are.</v>

1475
01:09:58.521 --> 01:10:03.521
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking things and some of them are </v>

1476
01:10:03.521 --> 01:10:05.440
<v Speaker 3>operating illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't give a shit if they come </v>

1477
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.771
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take all your stuff and they take </v>

1478
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 3>all your money and some people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a little time here and there,</v>

1479
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part for like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>egregious things,</v>

1480
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.300
<v Speaker 3>we'll do a little time here and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>for most parts.</v>

1481
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Jacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for people who,</v>

1483
01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't sympathetic to the marijuana </v>

1484
01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.231
<v Speaker 3>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't know if anybody listening </v>

1485
01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:23.231
<v Speaker 3>to this show isn't sympathetic to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause,</v>

1486
01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:25.460
<v Speaker 3>but presuming there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take the cars out to the Ra,</v>

1487
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 3>the whole raw milk.</v>

1488
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take that out too.</v>

1489
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 3>That I watched a documentary called </v>
<v Speaker 3>farmagedden.</v>

1490
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gunned know agents with guns going in,</v>

1491
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.920
<v Speaker 3>locking up yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freezers,</v>

1492
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 3>yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freezers,</v>

1493
01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:43.540
<v Speaker 3>and then jacking these farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like little farms they're </v>

1494
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:43.540
<v Speaker 3>selling to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got these kids saying,</v>

1495
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.220
<v Speaker 3>oh my asthma was way better when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking the whole milk.</v>

1496
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Raw milk is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously way better for you all.</v>

1497
01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I'll a lot of this lactose intolerance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1498
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.590
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>homogenized,</v>

1499
01:10:55.250 --> 01:11:00.250
<v Speaker 3>pasteurized and processed the milk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great if you're dealing with a </v>

1500
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.420
<v Speaker 3>city and you have to store milk for </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks in advance.</v>

1501
01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:06.590
<v Speaker 3>It is certainly more healthy than </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting people raw milk that goes bad.</v>

1502
01:11:06.591 --> 01:11:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Then everybody gets sick and that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen too.</v>

1503
01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:13.811
<v Speaker 3>So I see why it was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea someone could have a source</v>

1504
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 3>where they could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could get raw milk and they can get</v>

1505
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:21.120
<v Speaker 3>it from a farm and that farm sells it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supermarket.</v>

1506
01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:22.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all safe and fresh.</v>

1507
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:23.560
<v Speaker 3>It's dated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good,</v>

1508
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.940
<v Speaker 3>but that's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

1509
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll arrest you with guns.</v>

1510
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Guns drawn.</v>

1511
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess what would happen though,</v>

1512
01:11:30.561 --> 01:11:32.870
<v Speaker 4>if the government didn't come in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate that,</v>

1513
01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1514
01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.720
<v Speaker 4>consumers would start to look for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1515
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.820
<v Speaker 4>do I want this milk or do I want this </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk?</v>

1516
01:11:37.821 --> 01:11:42.821
<v Speaker 4>And you start to identify brands or </v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be consumer watchdog services </v>

1517
01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:43.010
<v Speaker 4>that came up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1518
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:45.200
<v Speaker 4>these milks are good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These milks or sketch,</v>

1519
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:50.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't drink these milks and the system </v>

1520
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:51.620
<v Speaker 4>would self correct itself and instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>locking people up,</v>

1521
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:55.430
<v Speaker 4>it taking away whole stashes of yogurt.</v>

1522
01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Sandwiches work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.800
<v Speaker 3>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the system in effect for the </v>

1524
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.051
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many fucking people drop dead every </v>

1525
01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:08.200
<v Speaker 3>year for Oxycontin's and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't they beating down their door </v>

1526
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:08.200
<v Speaker 3>with guns and trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck's going on here?</v>

1527
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:09.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1528
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Then the too busy arresting farmers for </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad yogurt,</v>

1529
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

1530
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:17.300
<v Speaker 3>And by bad yogurt we mean good yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:12:17.301 --> 01:12:20.450
<v Speaker 3>by Delicious Yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange thing man.</v>

1532
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.630
<v Speaker 3>We have a strange world and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1533
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all going through a growth phase.</v>

1534
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:32.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like a 16 year old is throwing </v>
<v Speaker 3>temper tantrums because they about to </v>

1535
01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 3>become a grownup and they're not quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>there yet,</v>

1536
01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:35.000
<v Speaker 3>but they're fucking think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking tell you bitch,</v>

1537
01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get crazy.</v>

1538
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:38.480
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real weird.</v>

1539
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:40.130
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird to be a part of.</v>

1540
01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:45.190
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you have the government </v>

1541
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:45.350
<v Speaker 4>telling you what is good for you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is not good for you.</v>

1542
01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:50.710
<v Speaker 4>It kind of removes people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to take the onus on </v>

1543
01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:50.710
<v Speaker 4>themselves to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1544
01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go out and procure what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>good for my body.</v>

1545
01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.190
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people just blindly trust like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1546
01:12:55.191 --> 01:12:56.580
<v Speaker 4>the FDA says it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1547
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:57.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

1548
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:58.400
<v Speaker 4>It's FDA approved</v>

1549
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:02.230
<v Speaker 3>one source than a government resource at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this point in time.</v>

1550
01:13:02.231 --> 01:13:05.680
<v Speaker 3>There should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of a government resources should</v>

1551
01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:10.681
<v Speaker 3>be consumer based resources that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more effective because they're motivated</v>

1552
01:13:10.751 --> 01:13:12.400
<v Speaker 3>by something other than just having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1553
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It's something they have a passion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I don't believe in.</v>

1554
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you have a government agency </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and like God who gets that job</v>

1555
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:19.510
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1556
01:13:19.511 --> 01:13:24.511
<v Speaker 3>are you sure that that guy is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking into making sure that yogurt </v>

1557
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:24.700
<v Speaker 3>safe or is he just some asshole with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job?</v>

1558
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:25.480
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1559
01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.550
<v Speaker 4>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it could be even good people in that</v>

1560
01:13:28.551 --> 01:13:30.950
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to enforce bad laws.</v>

1561
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.950
<v Speaker 4>These people in all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>

1562
01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.740
<v Speaker 4>they could very well be good people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear stories of them just saying,</v>

1563
01:13:36.741 --> 01:13:38.090
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't take it anymore.</v>

1564
01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:40.340
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm having to enforce bad laws that come</v>

1565
01:13:40.341 --> 01:13:43.280
<v Speaker 4>in with a positive ideal in every one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these bodies,</v>

1566
01:13:43.281 --> 01:13:48.281
<v Speaker 4>but just the system is designed to force</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to enforce messed up laws and </v>

1567
01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.870
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that creates a problem.</v>

1568
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but going back to what I was saying </v>

1569
01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1570
01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:56.420
<v Speaker 4>when someone's telling you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't take that onus on yourself.</v>

1571
01:13:56.630 --> 01:14:01.630
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think everybody thinks that it's </v>

1572
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.171
<v Speaker 4>really helping people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately the only person that can </v>

1573
01:14:05.171 --> 01:14:06.370
<v Speaker 4>decide what is good or bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1574
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.650
<v Speaker 4>the only person that decide what's good </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Joe Rogan,</v>

1575
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1576
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 4>you got to do the research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to figure it out and figure out </v>

1577
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 4>what's good for your body.</v>

1578
01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:20.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are a really cool analogy that I </v>

1579
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.090
<v Speaker 4>just recently heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1580
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 4>we have millions of different cells in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our body.</v>

1581
01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 4>We all know that and if you think of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those cells is individual life forms.</v>

1582
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:31.650
<v Speaker 4>Then we have millions of lifeforms that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are under our control and doing our </v>

1583
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:31.930
<v Speaker 4>bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank Leslie.</v>

1584
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:37.110
<v Speaker 4>They just go to work everyday and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're supposed to do for us and </v>

1585
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 4>we are like their God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are their rulers.</v>

1586
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:43.441
<v Speaker 4>We control their life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can make their life difficult or we </v>

1587
01:14:43.441 --> 01:14:43.660
<v Speaker 4>can make their life good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have feeding.</v>

1588
01:14:43.661 --> 01:14:48.661
<v Speaker 4>I'm shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are the gods of our body and you can </v>

1589
01:14:48.661 --> 01:14:52.891
<v Speaker 4>almost say they work so hard and so well</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us that they could almost say they </v>

1590
01:14:52.891 --> 01:14:52.891
<v Speaker 4>pray to us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1591
01:14:52.891 --> 01:14:57.630
<v Speaker 4>whatever analogy you want to use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there for us and what do we do </v>

1592
01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:57.630
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1593
01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:59.650
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The coffee's probably not nearly the bad</v>

1594
01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 4>thing that we do to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1595
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:02.830
<v Speaker 4>that makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes an impact.</v>

1596
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cigarettes should the bad processed </v>

1597
01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.950
<v Speaker 4>foods that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Green,</v>

1598
01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 4>no vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We come from the earth.</v>

1599
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.290
<v Speaker 4>We got to put a little bit of that back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

1600
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 4>put some real fuel back in there.</v>

1601
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:18.420
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>neglect more than anything.</v>

1602
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 3>The nutrition and health and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1603
01:15:21.841 --> 01:15:26.841
<v Speaker 3>I've obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had intelligent friends that laugh </v>

1604
01:15:26.841 --> 01:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>that mock me for working out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1605
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.520
<v Speaker 3>they think it's beneath them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1606
01:15:29.521 --> 01:15:31.230
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by being lazy,</v>

1607
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're limiting the quality of your life</v>

1608
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:38.750
<v Speaker 3>and you think that that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just being lazy and you </v>

1609
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.540
<v Speaker 3>just sort of justifying it with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1610
01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silly attitude.</v>

1611
01:15:41.731 --> 01:15:45.980
<v Speaker 3>The silly hipster like attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing would ever gives a shit.</v>

1612
01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:47.460
<v Speaker 3>You can do it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1613
01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 3>that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.520
<v Speaker 4>To live like that or they discredit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>value of it,</v>

1615
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.660
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just about physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about what that does for your mind.</v>

1616
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The confidence in certain situations,</v>

1617
01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:03.590
<v Speaker 4>the ability to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take care of yourself as a man,</v>

1618
01:16:03.591 --> 01:16:05.270
<v Speaker 4>as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a human being,</v>

1619
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it messes,</v>

1620
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.440
<v Speaker 4>it changes your mental dynamic.</v>

1621
01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:14.610
<v Speaker 3>He certainly does and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think that your mind functions </v>

1622
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:14.610
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1623
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you can have a really brilliant person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't take care of their body,</v>

1624
01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:21.021
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they be even more brilliant if </v>

1625
01:16:21.021 --> 01:16:21.021
<v Speaker 3>they did take care of their body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they would.</v>

1626
01:16:21.021 --> 01:16:24.891
<v Speaker 3>I think the amount of emphasis that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put on your mental function can be </v>

1627
01:16:24.891 --> 01:16:29.840
<v Speaker 3>delayed or retarded by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's not keeping up or that your </v>

1628
01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 3>body's sending shitty signals so your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body's tired all the time he bought.</v>

1629
01:16:32.581 --> 01:16:35.430
<v Speaker 3>He needs naps all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is breaking down.</v>

1630
01:16:35.431 --> 01:16:40.431
<v Speaker 3>It's always getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always that that derails the </v>

1631
01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:40.530
<v Speaker 3>quality of your thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1632
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having excess stress in your mind </v>

1633
01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.700
<v Speaker 3>rose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of your thinking as well,</v>

1634
01:16:47.701 --> 01:16:48.400
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1635
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.910
<v Speaker 3>you're quicker to pull the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You quicker to yell.</v>

1636
01:16:50.911 --> 01:16:52.840
<v Speaker 3>You're quicker to be upset about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

1637
01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:57.870
<v Speaker 3>You're not in control of your vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1638
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Silly pitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1639
01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need martial arts band.</v>

1640
01:17:02.221 --> 01:17:07.221
<v Speaker 3>That's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say we need to teach them in fucking </v>

1641
01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:07.221
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think kids,</v>

1642
01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:11.151
<v Speaker 3>every kid in school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be something learn like </v>

1643
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:11.151
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>

1644
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.130
<v Speaker 2>You should learn martial arts and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be in grade school,</v>

1645
01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Middle School,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

1646
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:16.250
<v Speaker 2>College.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>

1647
01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I think there would be way less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way less.</v>

1648
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1649
01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:25.860
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those weird things where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think that it would create </v>

1650
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.511
<v Speaker 2>bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it would be just the </v>

1651
01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:28.511
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The opposite.</v>

1652
01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:28.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The discipline,</v>

1653
01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:32.350
<v Speaker 2>self respect to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're doing something like </v>

1654
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:34.721
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure striking stools can create some </v>

1655
01:17:34.721 --> 01:17:34.721
<v Speaker 2>massive egos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that,</v>

1656
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know something like you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very difficult to create a </v>

1657
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.730
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate ego in that,</v>

1658
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless there's some cases where </v>

1659
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 2>someone's just so good that they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat everybody and then they get to be a</v>

1660
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:47.180
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1661
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids that grows up quicker than the </v>

1662
01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 2>other kids are like super fast twitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle fibers.</v>

1663
01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's possible too.</v>

1664
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:59.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would cut down on so much if more </v>

1665
01:17:59.170 --> 01:17:59.780
<v Speaker 2>people had that kind of a discipline in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

1666
01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.870
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to fix the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody.</v>

1667
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I had somebody on the podcast once and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about kettlebells,</v>

1668
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.930
<v Speaker 2>battle ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that,</v>

1669
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 2>and the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you making a fucking army?</v>

1670
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1671
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.100
<v Speaker 2>He'd getting people to work out and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and shit,</v>

1672
01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:18.101
<v Speaker 2>and then you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you tell them the propaganda's </v>

1673
01:18:18.101 --> 01:18:18.950
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and they need to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1674
01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>we're not making it an army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can make your own army.</v>

1675
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.720
<v Speaker 2>You could follow our advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your own shit.</v>

1676
01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm on fucking army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No time for that.</v>

1677
01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Can't even say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say you're making an army.</v>

1678
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:32.190
<v Speaker 2>The NSA light goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue light goes off.</v>

1679
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>We're creating consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're creating a consciousness epidemic.</v>

1680
01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.030
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

1681
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what color his left in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these plagues.</v>

1682
01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny thing.</v>

1683
01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:46.451
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have these analogies of horrible </v>

1684
01:18:46.451 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 2>destructive things happening on a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>

1685
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 2>but what's like the nuclear bomb of </v>
<v Speaker 2>goodness,</v>

1686
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 2>like nothing exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blowjobs in the nuclear bomb.</v>

1687
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1688
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It's all a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1689
01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not giving anything back just </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to you,</v>

1690
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but it only happens on a one on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

1691
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:10.061
<v Speaker 2>It would need to be a massive 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>person at a time blow job and if there </v>

1692
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 2>was something they could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would become the analogy.</v>

1693
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that this shamonic </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing thing is something that could </v>

1694
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 2>be taught?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in classes like yoga classes,</v>

1695
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 2>we can get a bunch of people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing it together?</v>

1696
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if people were willing to </v>

1697
01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 2>explore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to stay.</v>

1698
01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think isolation tanks or another </v>

1699
01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.211
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of these methods need to </v>

1700
01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 2>be explored and proliferated throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1701
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:41.170
<v Speaker 2>throughout our consciousness as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.620
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be taught like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1703
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:45.890
<v Speaker 2>you want to get back in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's a little more real,</v>

1704
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:50.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a little bit deeper in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not clouded by all of the voices </v>

1705
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:54.791
<v Speaker 2>of the dream is the toltec say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or our emotions and our needs and our </v>

1706
01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 2>wants and when all this crap that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in our head,</v>

1707
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 2>you want to tap into something a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper,</v>

1708
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:04.451
<v Speaker 2>a little more real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more connected to your fellow </v>

1709
01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:04.451
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1710
01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:05.840
<v Speaker 2>this is one method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another method,</v>

1711
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1712
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe for</v>

1713
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 4>some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's some other things that totally </v>

1714
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:15.800
<v Speaker 4>obviously you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we believe should be legal like </v>

1715
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.970
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and then get it down to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>science where you know exactly how much,</v>

1716
01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:19.940
<v Speaker 4>what your dose is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe go on a stale,</v>

1717
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:24.950
<v Speaker 4>get your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your accurate biometrics combined </v>

1718
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.831
<v Speaker 4>science with shamanism to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproducible results and an experience </v>

1719
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:33.351
<v Speaker 4>that's not clinical but not entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>just on the fringe of spirituality as </v>

1720
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:38.391
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think you could really affect </v>

1721
01:20:38.391 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 4>people's consciousness doing it in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1722
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:43.670
<v Speaker 1>What's the laws on sending people down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Peru or Brazil or to do Iowaska </v>

1723
01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1724
01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.560
<v Speaker 4>far as I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you abide by the laws of the country </v>

1725
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:52.820
<v Speaker 4>that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know their federal.</v>

1726
01:20:52.821 --> 01:20:53.100
<v Speaker 4>There's no</v>

1727
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 1>federal jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True anymore.</v>

1728
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I think there's been new regulations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been passed that say that if </v>

1729
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.741
<v Speaker 1>you do illegal things and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that you can be prosecuted </v>

1730
01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:04.770
<v Speaker 1>farm here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think.</v>

1731
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think the idea behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what the use was </v>

1733
01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.121
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of the things that </v>

1734
01:21:14.121 --> 01:21:15.510
<v Speaker 1>they use to sort of sneak that thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>go into Thailand,</v>

1735
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 1>which I agree with 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I agree with pedophilia.</v>

1736
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:20.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Fox.</v>

1737
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:22.590
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I said was that I agree that yeah,</v>

1738
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you should prosecute people for doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1739
01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Prosecute people that are doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

1740
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's legal or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking crime on humanity,</v>

1741
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.590
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1742
01:21:30.591 --> 01:21:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1743
01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:36.050
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to use that against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never heard of a case of that </v>

1744
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.090
<v Speaker 1>actually coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1745
01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the laws that are in place,</v>

1746
01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the NDA,</v>

1747
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:45.410
<v Speaker 1>there's no been no cases of that either </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't really</v>

1748
01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:50.060
<v Speaker 4>be prosecuted for doing a past substance</v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

1749
01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:53.550
<v Speaker 4>So it would be really tricky to try and </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecute someone past substance,</v>

1750
01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:55.850
<v Speaker 4>like saying like if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone says,</v>

1751
01:21:55.851 --> 01:21:56.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did acid,</v>

1752
01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year ago,</v>

1753
01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is not prosecutable.</v>

1754
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Dan would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

1755
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:04.260
<v Speaker 1>only yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1756
01:22:04.261 --> 01:22:09.261
<v Speaker 1>From then before the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there would have to be </v>

1757
01:22:09.261 --> 01:22:09.690
<v Speaker 1>grandfathered in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1758
01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it'd be interesting this new </v>

1759
01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.281
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you went there now and they </v>

1760
01:22:16.281 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 1>found out that you did marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amsterdam month ago,</v>

1761
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.840
<v Speaker 1>would they be able to prosecute you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1762
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Someone knocking on the door and if so </v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you answering it?</v>

1763
01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Don't answer that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that,</v>

1764
01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:33.391
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that you can't get </v>

1765
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:33.391
<v Speaker 4>prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hate to,</v>

1766
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hate to deter people from going </v>

1767
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.780
<v Speaker 4>on these journeys and expeditions with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fear of mine.</v>

1768
01:22:37.781 --> 01:22:39.700
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether the laws they're not.</v>

1769
01:22:39.701 --> 01:22:42.970
<v Speaker 4>I think practically it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't heard of a case of it,</v>

1770
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.550
<v Speaker 4>but I'd like to explore that and see it.</v>

1771
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the real issue would be like say if</v>

1772
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 1>we decided to create some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counseling service,</v>

1773
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:56.091
<v Speaker 1>we sit down with people and the decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're crazy or </v>

1774
01:22:56.091 --> 01:22:58.530
<v Speaker 1>undercover cops and then allow them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign up and go to Brazil.</v>

1775
01:22:59.070 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people who do that already to a </v>

1776
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.500
<v Speaker 4>certain degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1777
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't got,</v>

1778
01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:11.671
<v Speaker 4>they haven't been fucked with as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones that I know or anybody that </v>

1779
01:23:11.671 --> 01:23:14.611
<v Speaker 4>I've heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they could be just flying under the </v>

1780
01:23:14.611 --> 01:23:14.611
<v Speaker 4>radar possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:23:14.611 --> 01:23:18.480
<v Speaker 4>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is what happens if someone </v>

1782
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 4>actually tries to do something like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and create a service and we should,</v>

1783
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:23.770
<v Speaker 4>we should explore that and get some more</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

1784
01:23:23.771 --> 01:23:25.010
<v Speaker 4>We're just talking out our ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1785
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.290
<v Speaker 4>We don't really know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1786
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1787
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Speaker 4>I like your thinking and that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>also part of my thinking is what are the</v>

1788
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:36.811
<v Speaker 4>ways that we can do things fully above </v>
<v Speaker 4>board because we can't in consciousness </v>

1789
01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 4>recommend people to do illegal things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The risk is there.</v>

1790
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:41.730
<v Speaker 4>The stress of doing that is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1791
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.160
<v Speaker 4>we're not trying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we want to create a change and a lot</v>

1792
01:23:45.161 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 4>of these changes change.</v>

1793
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Creating events are illegal buyer </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1794
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:51.340
<v Speaker 4>So how to work our way around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1795
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 4>some of the things find the legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experiences breathing,</v>

1796
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isolation tanks,</v>

1797
01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.040
<v Speaker 4>certain types of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's then if you want to take it </v>

1798
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:02.040
<v Speaker 4>farther.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 4>go out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know in Canada,</v>

1800
01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 4>even the Boga is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is legal.</v>

1801
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I know South America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada,</v>

1802
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:08.760
<v Speaker 4>it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.220
<v Speaker 4>And in UK,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada and UK,</v>

1804
01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 4>bogus legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in most of South America I was </v>

1805
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:21.191
<v Speaker 4>because legal and also the church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Church of Santa Diamond or udv and </v>

1806
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:23.260
<v Speaker 4>always get those two mixed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's two.</v>

1807
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 4>There's two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both illegal now.</v>

1808
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I think both of us both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1809
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:32.730
<v Speaker 4>So that may be another way too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is really kind of allow people to </v>

1810
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:38.161
<v Speaker 4>become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Explain that for people don't know what </v>

1811
01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:38.161
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a,</v>

1812
01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a freedom of religion act that </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows you to have your sacrament,</v>

1813
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.730
<v Speaker 4>whatever that sacrament can be.</v>

1814
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:47.790
<v Speaker 4>If it's intrinsic to your religion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two religions based out of </v>

1815
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Brazil that focus on the Iowasca as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>major sacrament,</v>

1816
01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:56.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the union has a vigil to Lisa</v>

1817
01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:56.610
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1818
01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:01.980
<v Speaker 4>it's in important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the church is sent to </v>

1819
01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:01.980
<v Speaker 4>diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is another one.</v>

1820
01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:06.060
<v Speaker 4>And both of them use ios because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrament and they brought it all the </v>

1821
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:06.060
<v Speaker 4>way to the supreme court and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1822
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.550
<v Speaker 4>we want to use our sacrament to express </v>
<v Speaker 4>our religious freedoms.</v>

1823
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:11.030
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1824
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:14.380
<v Speaker 4>one good good move by the supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 4>is they,</v>

1825
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:19.500
<v Speaker 4>they upheld that based on the freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion act and there was precedence </v>

1826
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.830

1917
01:29:11.661 --> 01:29:11.661
<v Speaker 1>Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're legit.</v>

1918
01:29:11.661 --> 01:29:15.620
<v Speaker 1>They have a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons that I lived </v>

1919
01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado for a little while.</v>

1920
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a place where it's more </v>

1921
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>relaxed but also has real comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1922
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few places,</v>

1923
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:27.201
<v Speaker 1>but Boston used to be the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a kid named Rick Jenkins </v>

1924
01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:30.921
<v Speaker 1>member Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he runs this place in Boston and </v>

1925
01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:33.981
<v Speaker 1>Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Boston comedy studio or something </v>

1926
01:29:33.981 --> 01:29:33.981
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the Chinese restaurant.</v>

1927
01:29:33.981 --> 01:29:38.331
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's the one guy in Boston who's </v>

1928
01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:38.331
<v Speaker 1>really keeping that city alive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find them all the time and they're</v>

1942
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:05.930
<v Speaker 1>popping up more and more now I think </v>

<v Speaker 1>place apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Became famous because of the Internet.</v>

1950
01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Like literally someone found it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1951
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:22.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this.</v>

1952
01:30:22.981 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 1>They sent it became viral boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>

1953
01:30:25.591 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 1>the guy selling out theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber,</v>

1954
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really young.</v>

1955
01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 15 when he was first doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really is.</v>

1958
01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:43.941

<v Speaker 1>like I got drew Carey this year hosting </v>

<v Speaker 1>people who were ready to rock and roll </v>

1961
01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.780

<v Speaker 1>situation where they're all with great </v>

1962

<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1964

<v Speaker 1>So are you still going to do some </v>

2007
01:32:43.681 --> 01:32:45.901
<v Speaker 1>standup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you were putting together this </v>

01:32:45.901 --> 01:32:45.901
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I gotta I got a few minutes ready.</v>

2010
01:32:45.901 --> 01:32:46.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough.</v>

2011
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my girlfriend is the only one </v>

2012
01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that's heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

2013
01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:54.880
<v Speaker 1>she's in the back and she's covered her </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2014
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 1>She did one of those cat pictures or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats like,</v>

2015
01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:00.640
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this shit again,</v>

2016
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 1>don't try any of my material and my wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2017
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I'll be writing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and she'll like,</v>

2018
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:11.310
<v Speaker 1>she'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you writing down?</v>

2019
01:33:11.311 --> 01:33:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to hear it?</v>

2020
01:33:12.191 --> 01:33:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2021
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 1>do I really want to hear it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2022
01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:15.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

2023
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:17.890
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

2025
01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't like try out shit on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't appreciate that.</v>

2026
01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:27.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the other problem is then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've heard it already and then they </v>

2027
01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>see you do it on stage and yeah.</v>

2028
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And they probably would laugh that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if they didn't know you were </v>

2029
01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.080
<v Speaker 1>going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people have said like they got</v>

2030
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.320
<v Speaker 1>upset at me because some of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on my standup comedy special </v>

2031
01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.450
<v Speaker 1>with stuff that I initially said on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and then like explored further,</v>

2032
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:48.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's part of my creative process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say something on the podcast and it's </v>

2033
01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:49.240
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I supposed to do?</v>

2034
01:33:49.241 --> 01:33:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Just let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2035
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to turn that bitch into a bit now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2036
01:33:55.141 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just like,</v>

2037
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 1>or with gold pieces in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to refine that down.</v>

2038
01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Peurto yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With stuff.</v>

2039
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the weird thing about standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy that people don't realize.</v>

2040
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a dude's just up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

2041
01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more to it than that.</v>

2042
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:11.280
<v Speaker 1>There's so much extra shit.</v>

2043
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It seems like one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges that I've ever.</v>

2044
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what drew me to it is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems so hard.</v>

2045
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done like debate speaking.</v>

2046
01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I've done large scale public speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentations,</v>

2047
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.620
<v Speaker 1>expressing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

2048
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>not difficult for me for whatever my </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution is,</v>

2049
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:30.250
<v Speaker 1>but to actually go up there and have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make people laugh,</v>

2050
01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2051
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea if this will cause a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chuckle or they'll just be stone silent,</v>

2052
01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:43.261
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny art form because it's </v>

2054
01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 1>everybody's capable of doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain like small doses.</v>

2055
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's capable of doing it like at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a party or amongst friends or you can </v>

2056
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:54.790
<v Speaker 1>get a concept out that happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny and,</v>

2057
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of people laugh and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes very intoxicating,</v>

2058
01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you can go and address</v>

2059
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people that don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2060
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that are expecting to laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that paying money to sneak around the </v>

2061
01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:13.601
<v Speaker 1>back and give them some landfill and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for just the drink at </v>

2062
01:35:13.601 --> 01:35:16.661
<v Speaker 1>some conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a good guy to talk to is Brian </v>

2063
01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:19.271
<v Speaker 1>because Brian sort of got in on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat codes because Brian was stand up </v>

2064
01:35:19.271 --> 01:35:23.231
<v Speaker 1>comedy because Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first employed him wasn't doing </v>

2065
01:35:23.231 --> 01:35:24.590
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had done comedy,</v>

2066
01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:29.591
<v Speaker 1>but he quit and he didn't do it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years and years and the day he</v>

2067
01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:34.991
<v Speaker 1>went back and tried it again was during </v>
<v Speaker 1>a UFC crowd in it Lanta on a fucking </v>

2068
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2069
01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So it was a gangster and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>midnight show</v>

2070
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:47.030
<v Speaker 4>and it's not like I had all my material </v>
<v Speaker 4>remembered.</v>

2071
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:52.031
<v Speaker 4>It was like three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years ago since I've been on stage </v>

2072
01:35:52.031 --> 01:35:52.031
<v Speaker 4>and I just had to go up on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2073
01:35:52.031 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I got only that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know you yet because this </v>

2074
01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:56.860
<v Speaker 1>was pre podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was pre podcast.</v>

2075
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:59.530
<v Speaker 1>This was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he has cheat codes.</v>

2076
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody knows who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know he's ridiculous.</v>

2077
01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.880
<v Speaker 1>He goes out there and talks about coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2078
01:36:03.881 --> 01:36:05.970
<v Speaker 1>People started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2079
01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you</v>

2080
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Speaker 4>about five years or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't watch it.</v>

2081
01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2082
01:36:18.821 --> 01:36:20.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't eat a dick,</v>

2083
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 1>but you had several moments where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>licked the shaft and put some balls in </v>

2084
01:36:26.011 --> 01:36:27.480
<v Speaker 1>your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't,</v>

2085
01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you didn't eat the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2086
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I pulled out of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was one of the most impressive</v>

2087
01:36:31.261 --> 01:36:36.261
<v Speaker 1>things I've said that night because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had some moments where you did really </v>

2088
01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:37.740
<v Speaker 1>well and then you have a dropoff bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2089
01:36:37.741 --> 01:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

2090
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hardest thing is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose confidence in you and they're </v>

2091
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.040
<v Speaker 1>not laughing to bring them back and only</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

2092
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't ever work in black crowds,</v>

2093
01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:48.900
<v Speaker 1>black crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you lose it,</v>

2094
01:36:48.901 --> 01:36:53.901
<v Speaker 1>you got to get off the stage and run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't try to get it back because </v>

2095
01:36:53.901 --> 01:36:53.901
<v Speaker 1>it's not coming back.</v>

2096
01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Brian Brian a couple years ago and</v>

2097
01:36:57.681 --> 01:36:59.170
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were okay then,</v>

2098
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:02.060
<v Speaker 4>but I saw you in Austin and you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking good man.</v>

2099
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Thanks like I got to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 4>prompts like you were seriously funny </v>

2100
01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:07.090
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's been,</v>

2101
01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:07.460
<v Speaker 4>it's been cool to see that</v>

2102
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:10.690
<v Speaker 1>he's got the cheat codes but he also has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a material too.</v>

2103
01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:11.670
<v Speaker 1>He works at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2104
01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:14.110
<v Speaker 1>he's up tonight at the ice house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to do it,</v>

2105
01:37:14.111 --> 01:37:14.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2106
01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.980
<v Speaker 4>you got to just jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You to jump in.</v>

2107
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking how much material have you </v>
<v Speaker 4>written?</v>

2108
01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've timed myself and I have like a nine</v>

2109
01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:26.960
<v Speaker 4>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven minute,</v>

2110
01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:28.850
<v Speaker 4>five minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda three minute.</v>

2111
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten that far so I know</v>

2112
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:36.030
<v Speaker 1>well that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have nine minutes you could </v>

2113
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.030
<v Speaker 1>probably do five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:38.330
<v Speaker 1>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan material needs to be true.</v>

2115
01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2116
01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:42.590
<v Speaker 1>But I have nothing to trim it by like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

2117
01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.270
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do I turn that?</v>

2118
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.200
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to just bomb a few times.</v>

2119
01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that sort of list you to read it to </v>

2120
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:51.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to listen.</v>

2121
01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

2122
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you've seen a lot of comedy shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta able to sit there and</v>

2123
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.330
<v Speaker 2>like sort of listened to it yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes.</v>

2124
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.720
<v Speaker 2>But that's hard too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's some shit.</v>

2125
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll write something and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's funny and then I'll go on </v>

2126
01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>stage and one part of it that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think was funny is the funniest part.</v>

2127
01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:14.620
<v Speaker 2>They're like howling laughing at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one observation and I thought that this </v>

2128
01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.730
<v Speaker 2>other part was the really funny part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2129
01:38:15.731 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comedy to this day is still.</v>

2130
01:38:18.901 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of mystery involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of.</v>

2131
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange art form.</v>

2132
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:29.990
<v Speaker 2>The challenging part for me at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point is just deciding on my tone </v>

2133
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:31.860
<v Speaker 2>because there's almost a persona that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring up there.</v>

2134
01:38:31.861 --> 01:38:36.861
<v Speaker 2>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's you being a little bit more of </v>

2135
01:38:36.861 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 2>this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the type of energy you bring.</v>

2136
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:43.251
<v Speaker 2>Some comics are kind of laid back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they sneak the jokes in some more </v>

2137
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:45.270
<v Speaker 2>intense and they bring a lot of energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

2138
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Your delivery style delivery stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2139
01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:52.350
<v Speaker 2>you bring a lot of intensity generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and it had crushed and killed.</v>

2140
01:38:52.351 --> 01:38:53.930
<v Speaker 2>But then you'll see somebody else who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda,</v>

2141
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I guess like Mitch Hedberg or someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that who's like really kind of cool</v>

2142
01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.250
<v Speaker 2>planet and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

2143
01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to play my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

2144
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:04.380
<v Speaker 2>That's wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

2145
01:39:04.381 --> 01:39:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sort of accepted the way I do it.</v>

2146
01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:10.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't really enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very into like certain bits,</v>

2147
01:39:10.501 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 2>like certain bits or like more quiet </v>
<v Speaker 2>than other bits which are more frenzied.</v>

2148
01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2149
01:39:15.601 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Now when I write material I write it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>my voice already.</v>

2150
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Nobody here that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2151
01:39:19.331 --> 01:39:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2152
01:39:19.981 --> 01:39:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:26.180
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no right way to do it </v>

2154
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:26.180
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2155
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen guys change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

2156
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy who starts off and </v>

2157
01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.661
<v Speaker 2>he's sort of Jerry Seinfeld Dash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then somewhere along the line it </v>

2158
01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 2>becomes Dane Cook and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened here?</v>

2159
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like morphed man.</v>

2160
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Shit's weird right now because I </v>

2161
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:41.550
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My new bits are more story based bits.</v>

2162
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I go into these long stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have bits in it.</v>

2163
01:39:45.631 --> 01:39:48.550
<v Speaker 2>But then it goes into my older material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more just like joke,</v>

2164
01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.220
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

2165
01:39:49.221 --> 01:39:49.710
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

2166
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 2>jokes per minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where that's.</v>

2167
01:39:52.441 --> 01:39:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the evolution.</v>

2168
01:39:53.911 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>The evolution is you first start off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2169
01:39:56.701 --> 01:40:01.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to get things out of your mouth </v>

2170
01:40:01.701 --> 01:40:03.390
<v Speaker 2>that are going to get laughs and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at them as tools.</v>

2171
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Like there's this hammer work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2172
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to get it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first stage.</v>

2173
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And then the second stage is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2174
01:40:11.341 --> 01:40:16.341
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what makes you laugh instead of </v>

2175
01:40:16.341 --> 01:40:16.341
<v Speaker 2>what makes them laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2176
01:40:16.341 --> 01:40:16.341
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>

2177
01:40:16.341 --> 01:40:18.780
<v Speaker 2>What works instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would make you laugh if you were in</v>

2178
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:19.470
<v Speaker 2>the audience?</v>

2179
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:24.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the third stage is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get ideas across and point things out </v>

2180
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:29.871
<v Speaker 2>that you think are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like as you're moving through the </v>

2181
01:40:29.871 --> 01:40:30.480
<v Speaker 2>stages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first is just sort of jokes and then</v>

2182
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:35.690
<v Speaker 2>it becomes jokes that you think are </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny and then it becomes like things </v>

2183
01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:35.850
<v Speaker 2>that you're relating to different </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of your life.</v>

2184
01:40:35.851 --> 01:40:39.780
<v Speaker 2>And there's like stages of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of comedy.</v>

2185
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>

2186
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:46.551
<v Speaker 2>the the thing that that may get me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do it is I feel like if I </v>

2187
01:40:46.551 --> 01:40:50.121
<v Speaker 2>create interesting enough observations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the comedy isn't quite up to </v>

2188
01:40:50.121 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 2>mustard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come back and be like,</v>

2189
01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was interesting that he brought </v>

2190
01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that point up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2191
01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:56.360
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

2192
01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:56.360
<v Speaker 1>is probably kind of a backwards way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2193
01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's given me something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang onto,</v>

2194
01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:02.740
<v Speaker 1>so if I fucking bomb I will at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them aware of some shit they were </v>

2195
01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>not aware of before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Well Bill Hicks out of that saying so </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not funny,</v>

2197
01:41:07.031 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2199
01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it seems like it would work,</v>

2200
01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 6>but other times where you're on a date </v>
<v Speaker 6>with your girlfriend,</v>

2201
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's laugh tonight.</v>

2202
01:41:15.311 --> 01:41:20.311
<v Speaker 6>I want to go out and fucking laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you go do like a comedy show </v>

2203
01:41:20.311 --> 01:41:20.311
<v Speaker 6>that's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just interesting.</v>

2204
01:41:20.311 --> 01:41:20.710
<v Speaker 6>You'd probably be a little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be.</v>

2207
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.490
<v Speaker 1>bitches don't want to hear nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to hear poopy farty jokes.</v>

2208
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.200

2209
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:34.990

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2210
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:36.580
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people just want to,</v>

2304
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.480

<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

2305
01:46:27.690 --> 01:46:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Fifty cent and Joey Diaz coining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

2307
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:33.230
<v Speaker 1>to get Joyce's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's realistic.</v>

2308
01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to fuck white chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what's going on.</v>

2309
01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Probably really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with all that vitamin.</v>

2310
01:46:40.021 --> 01:46:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Water money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that shit that happened</v>

2311
01:46:42.151 --> 01:46:43.200
<v Speaker 1>with him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

2312
01:46:43.201 --> 01:46:46.120
<v Speaker 1>They had a fake feud online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2313
01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I saw in the 24 slash seven that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were boys though.</v>

2314
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I lost so much respect for them for</v>

2315
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a fake twitter feud where they </v>

2316
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:56.991
<v Speaker 3>pretended to be angry with each other to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get attention because they were trying </v>

2317
01:46:56.991 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're trying to pump</v>

2318
01:46:57.391 --> 01:47:02.391
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what a floyd's upcoming </v>

2319
01:47:02.391 --> 01:47:02.391
<v Speaker 3>fights are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck.</v>

2320
01:47:02.391 --> 01:47:06.111
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a fake twitter feud between floyd </v>

2321
01:47:06.111 --> 01:47:07.330
<v Speaker 3>and 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much as opposed</v>

2322
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 4>so much of that rap game is so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>image though too,</v>

2323
01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2324
01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:15.760
<v Speaker 4>they're just really putting on something</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 is actually one thing I do respect </v>

2325
01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.971
<v Speaker 4>about him is he actually wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Robert Greene called the 50th law </v>

2326
01:47:19.971 --> 01:47:23.540
<v Speaker 4>and in it he's very honest about his </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculating business approach to </v>

2327
01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.230
<v Speaker 4>creating a persona that's going to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2328
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't,</v>

2329
01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:31.250
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't do all the shit he talks </v>

2330
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.250
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2331
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.290
<v Speaker 4>sitting in the club with a bottle above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not doing that shit.</v>

2332
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.120
<v Speaker 4>He's back writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's plotting,</v>

2333
01:47:33.121 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 4>he's planning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very calculated in what he does and</v>

2334
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 4>when he talks he talks honestly about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2335
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 4>But to see him do some kind of public </v>
<v Speaker 4>feud,</v>

2336
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:41.150
<v Speaker 4>it's just seems</v>

2337
01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:43.180
<v Speaker 3>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems a little cheap.</v>

2338
01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Stupid Hammond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather getting together.</v>

2339
01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean aren't you guys both worth like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion bucks?</v>

2340
01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Fucking you fucking done like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of girls having a fake twitter feud.</v>

2341
01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:56.350
<v Speaker 3>They probably watched beverly hills </v>
<v Speaker 3>housewives land,</v>

2342
01:47:56.710 --> 01:47:58.790
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to get that strategy.</v>

2343
01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.590
<v Speaker 4>They want to create some real drama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get Floyd to fight fucking pack.</v>

2344
01:48:01.591 --> 01:48:01.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore sailed.</v>

2346
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sad.</v>

2347
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:09.830
<v Speaker 3>That one Marquez punched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just changed,</v>

2348
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:13.580
<v Speaker 3>changed everything to punches the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he knocked them down with earlier.</v>

2349
01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.220
<v Speaker 3>That changes a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the end one,</v>

2350
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.940
<v Speaker 3>the big one to put them away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was probably the most violent we've</v>

2351
01:48:19.941 --> 01:48:24.941
<v Speaker 3>ever seen a hero get knocked out because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tyson knockout was a beat down,</v>

2352
01:48:24.951 --> 01:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but he was conscious and he was moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>around trying to grab his mouthpiece and</v>

2353
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:29.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the referee rescued him.</v>

2354
01:48:29.681 --> 01:48:31.100
<v Speaker 3>He was standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2355
01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:36.340
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at like all the various </v>

2356
01:48:36.921 --> 01:48:41.540
<v Speaker 3>times that someone was a hero and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>got beat like in the prime,</v>

2357
01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:45.710
<v Speaker 3>that was the most violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Guy just got completely starts.</v>

2358
01:48:45.711 --> 01:48:49.220
<v Speaker 3>The second one would be Roy Jones jr </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we fought Glenn Johnson,</v>

2359
01:48:49.221 --> 01:48:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but by then he had already been knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>out one time.</v>

2360
01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:54.860
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have that invincible.</v>

2361
01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:59.270
<v Speaker 3>He'd already gotten knocked out by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox.</v>

2363
01:48:59.271 --> 01:49:03.890
<v Speaker 3>His name to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A handsome black guy.</v>

2364
01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is his name.</v>

2365
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't recall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes it.</v>

2366
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Makes me wonder if that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that very questionable lost that </v>

2367
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Pacquiao had had some impact on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology when he was going out there,</v>

2368
01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 4>like he was a little more aggressive or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that he was really trying to </v>

2369
01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:23.020
<v Speaker 4>prove that he wasn't going to leave it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the judge's hands.</v>

2370
01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Antonio Tarver Antonio Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2371
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:31.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that could have something to do </v>

2372
01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.841
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes a fighter just has your </v>

2373
01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:34.841
<v Speaker 3>number now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sometimes like they will,</v>

2374
01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that thing that they say style,</v>

2375
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:39.200
<v Speaker 3>make fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes fights and everybody says,</v>

2376
01:49:39.201 --> 01:49:40.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a cliche.</v>

2377
01:49:40.730 --> 01:49:43.340
<v Speaker 3>And it Kinda is a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of is true too.</v>

2378
01:49:43.341 --> 01:49:45.920
<v Speaker 3>There's some guys that just have a guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>

2379
01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Vernon forrest with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane Mosley Vernon forrest just had </v>

2380
01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:51.810
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane's number.</v>

2381
01:49:51.850 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Just knew he knew how to beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could beat him and sugar.</v>

2382
01:49:56.021 --> 01:50:01.021
<v Speaker 3>Shane would beat more guys in Vernon </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be if they both fought like the </v>

2383
01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:04.891
<v Speaker 3>same guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar Shane would win more than Vernon </v>

2384
01:50:04.891 --> 01:50:04.891
<v Speaker 3>would win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they got together Vernon,</v>

2385
01:50:04.891 --> 01:50:07.450
<v Speaker 3>one twice and the way he wanted it </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't look like sugar.</v>

2386
01:50:07.451 --> 01:50:12.451
<v Speaker 3>Shane was ever going to beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like he just had his number </v>

2387
01:50:12.451 --> 01:50:15.600
<v Speaker 3>and that's a strange thing with fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with fighting the way mark has and </v>

2388
01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 3>pack all lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2389
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:22.080
<v Speaker 3>They were just so God damn close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like what his strengths were </v>

2390
01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.230
<v Speaker 3>sorta overcame what pack strengths were </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what Pascal strengths were,</v>

2391
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.440
<v Speaker 3>were adjusted enough to edge by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark has two in two different fights </v>

2392
01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Speaker 3>that Mark Marquez could take a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch though.</v>

2393
01:50:34.151 --> 01:50:39.151
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>always still in the game because he can </v>

2394
01:50:39.151 --> 01:50:39.520
<v Speaker 3>take a punch and then fire back with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own shit.</v>

2395
01:50:39.521 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a lot of guys got overwhelmed by</v>
<v Speaker 3>pack power,</v>

2396
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:44.950
<v Speaker 3>enhance speed Marquez could take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2397
01:50:44.951 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 3>He could take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that made him like extra day.</v>

2398
01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:52.380
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to talk to the neurosurgeon </v>

2399
01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:52.380
<v Speaker 3>that we have working with on it about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2400
01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.320
<v Speaker 3>You know what it is about an individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>that allows them to take a punch.</v>

2401
01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2402
01:50:57.950 --> 01:51:01.060
<v Speaker 3>like what makes the short circuit easier</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

2403
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weak chin,</v>

2404
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

2405
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:05.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a combination of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2406
01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>

2407
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 3>big guys like Mark Hunt who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>legendary for his ability to take </v>

2408
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:13.390
<v Speaker 3>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cabbage who is legendary for his ability</v>

2409
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 3>to take punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big giant heads.</v>

2410
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:21.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both those guys that just big giant </v>

2411
01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:23.371
<v Speaker 3>fucking iron heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's all get some smaller </v>

2412
01:51:23.371 --> 01:51:27.091
<v Speaker 3>Mexican box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of Mexicans that really </v>

2413
01:51:27.091 --> 01:51:29.611
<v Speaker 3>good chin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some reason not to generalize but just </v>

2414
01:51:29.611 --> 01:51:31.660
<v Speaker 3>seems like that's part of the program </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then some of those lighter weights I</v>

2415
01:51:31.661 --> 01:51:36.661
<v Speaker 3>think with a lot of Mexicans would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is also is a certain amount of your </v>

2416
01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:42.331
<v Speaker 3>ability to take punishment is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire to win and your drive and your </v>

2417
01:51:42.331 --> 01:51:46.561
<v Speaker 3>heart and Mexican fighters have always </v>
<v Speaker 3>been known for their heart and their </v>

2418
01:51:46.561 --> 01:51:50.071
<v Speaker 3>toughness and endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your ability to withstand a shot and </v>

2419
01:51:50.071 --> 01:51:50.071
<v Speaker 3>come back because you're in shape and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you recover.</v>

2420
01:51:50.071 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 3>That's big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Mexican fighters have always been </v>

2421
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:57.541
<v Speaker 3>known for their willingness to scrap and</v>
<v Speaker 3>further their ability to take a shot and</v>

2422
01:51:58.301 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

2423
01:51:59.090 --> 01:52:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of that has to be like</v>

2424
01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.800
<v Speaker 3>a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drive,</v>

2425
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.020
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're proud of their ability to like.</v>

2426
01:52:05.021 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 3>They're not pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just overwhelming will.</v>

2427
01:52:07.661 --> 01:52:09.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't want any way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way,</v>

2428
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.490
<v Speaker 3>no way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now looking for a way to.</v>

2429
01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the great Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxers that embodied that,</v>

2430
01:52:14.831 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 3>like Julio Cesar Chavez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Chavez in his prime was was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>personified?</v>

2432
01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:25.170
<v Speaker 3>He would bite Donna's mouthpiece and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bell would ring and he was coming after </v>

2433
01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you and he wasn't thinking about whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not he was gonna win.</v>

2434
01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was definitely going to win.</v>

2435
01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.770
<v Speaker 3>It was just going to beat your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>

2436
01:52:29.771 --> 01:52:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to India,</v>

2437
01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you're hitting them hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang them,</v>

2438
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:36.870
<v Speaker 3>handle meldrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor and him fought for 12 fucking </v>

2439
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:40.171
<v Speaker 3>hard browns and with 10 seconds to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the twelfth he drops Meldrick Taylor</v>

2440
01:52:41.170 --> 01:52:42.280
<v Speaker 3>and they stopped the fight.</v>

2441
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ridiculous.</v>

2442
01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:49.291
<v Speaker 3>Like he was looking for a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always trying to win and he was </v>

2443
01:52:49.291 --> 01:52:50.030
<v Speaker 3>legendary and his ability to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

2444
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:55.330
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frankie randall came around and had </v>

2445
01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:58.121
<v Speaker 3>Chavez number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas he just had this fucking </v>

2446
01:52:58.121 --> 01:52:58.121
<v Speaker 3>powerful straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2447
01:52:58.121 --> 01:53:02.170
<v Speaker 3>He knew how to land it and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden Chavez was down and </v>

2448
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:02.170
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2449
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:05.210
<v Speaker 3>And he beat him twice and it was one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things where it's like,</v>

2450
01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.760
<v Speaker 3>this is just a dude that has his number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows,</v>

2451
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:12.761
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird how like how much you </v>

2452
01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:16.760
<v Speaker 3>know stylistically how much that factors</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to certain fights.</v>

2453
01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain guys where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see them fight the same dude 100 </v>

2454
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:25.370
<v Speaker 3>times and they're never going to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy and that guy breaks his hand or</v>

2455
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 3>slipped a disc in the middle of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to beat him.</v>

2456
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:30.040
<v Speaker 3>He's going to beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2457
01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Then there's Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking guys were.</v>

2458
01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

2459
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:38.990
<v Speaker 4>can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody that's ever going to beat him </v>

2460
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:41.650
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the more mindblowing </v>

2461
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:41.650
<v Speaker 4>sports events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been a couple of my life,</v>

2462
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:42.440
<v Speaker 4>but seeing him going to Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil,</v>

2463
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:46.220
<v Speaker 4>rob came with me to Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were ringside right there.</v>

2464
01:53:46.221 --> 01:53:51.221
<v Speaker 4>While that fight happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see him do that is just just blew </v>

2465
01:53:51.221 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 4>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2466
01:53:51.231 --> 01:53:54.170
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him do amazing things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pinpoint strikes,</v>

2467
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great maneuvers.</v>

2468
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 4>But the way he just did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying,</v>

2469
01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put myself,</v>

2470
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:01.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2471
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:04.940
<v Speaker 4>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dodged that spinning back,</v>

2472
01:54:04.941 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 4>kick it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit the fence,</v>

2473
01:54:06.081 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 4>and then he goes right back where that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick landed.</v>

2474
01:54:08.271 --> 01:54:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2475
01:54:08.970 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean you miss me there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm gonna stand right here.</v>

2476
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.050
<v Speaker 4>And then just slip them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2477
01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:14.870
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was what he was like operating on.</v>

2478
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Not just one level but several levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster than Stephan Bonner where he </v>

2479
01:54:21.861 --> 01:54:26.861
<v Speaker 3>could just move away from anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonded through any punch that he threw </v>

2480
01:54:26.861 --> 01:54:27.920
<v Speaker 3>he could roll with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he,</v>

2481
01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 3>he had such faith in his reflexes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his skill of,</v>

2482
01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:37.120
<v Speaker 3>of defense and avoiding things that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally backed his body up to the cage</v>

2483
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:40.270
<v Speaker 3>and allowed to do to throw shots at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen,</v>

2484
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 3>never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2485
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 3>And then when he decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he stopped the fight,</v>

2486
01:54:44.871 --> 01:54:48.710
<v Speaker 3>like almost immediately slammed a knee </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a solar plexus.</v>

2487
01:54:48.711 --> 01:54:51.860
<v Speaker 3>And the fights over and he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2488
01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.680
<v Speaker 4>You have to imagine that was the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>place that these legendary wars.</v>

2489
01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about Masashi before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that print,</v>

2490
01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 4>that place of no mind that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually reading a book,</v>

2491
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:07.301
<v Speaker 4>which was a crazy radical book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if we want to get </v>

2492
01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:07.301
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called zero limits.</v>

2493
01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:10.900
<v Speaker 4>But one good thing about it is it talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about getting to a zero state in the </v>

2494
01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 4>zero state is where there's no thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no emotion,</v>

2495
01:55:13.341 --> 01:55:18.341
<v Speaker 4>no anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing left to come to you is </v>

2496
01:55:18.341 --> 01:55:18.341
<v Speaker 4>inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2497
01:55:18.341 --> 01:55:20.780
<v Speaker 4>but for an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the zero state I think is the zone,</v>

2498
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:25.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's where there's absolutely nothing </v>

2499
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.830
<v Speaker 4>interfering with your training and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>instincts.</v>

2500
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he just taps into that completely.</v>

2501
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:30.290
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his impulses are just right.</v>

2502
01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no nothing blocking what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows how to do.</v>

2503
01:55:33.591 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 4>And he's trained himself to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>already physically.</v>

2504
01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:39.500
<v Speaker 4>And then mentally he's impeccable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're</v>

2505
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:43.540
<v Speaker 3>so confident now too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like with every fight that he's won</v>

2506
01:55:43.541 --> 01:55:48.541
<v Speaker 3>in the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like slowly moved his way into </v>

2507
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:52.341
<v Speaker 3>where he's at now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like this almost unreachable </v>

2508
01:55:52.341 --> 01:55:54.831
<v Speaker 3>frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like all these people that are trying </v>

2509
01:55:54.831 --> 01:55:54.831
<v Speaker 3>to get to his title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at them and you're like,</v>

2510
01:55:54.831 --> 01:55:56.260
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really want a shot?</v>

2511
01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:01.280
<v Speaker 3>That guy cause I'm looking at the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you move and I look at the way he moves </v>

2512
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.821
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can move the way he </v>

2513
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:04.821
<v Speaker 3>moves and he's going to fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2514
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:04.821
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2515
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are talking good.</v>

2516
01:56:06.150 --> 01:56:11.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying they want to get a piece </v>

2517
01:56:11.150 --> 01:56:12.501
<v Speaker 3>at Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanna get a piece of that and then </v>

2518
01:56:12.501 --> 01:56:12.501
<v Speaker 3>you'll see them lose to some contender </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the way and you're like,</v>

2519
01:56:12.501 --> 01:56:13.530
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got lucky.</v>

2520
01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:18.590
<v Speaker 3>You lucky you avoided that execution </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the kind of execution that </v>

2521
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:21.921
<v Speaker 3>Anderson gives you is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>retirement executions where you just </v>

2522
01:56:21.921 --> 01:56:22.410
<v Speaker 3>step into ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Bond,</v>

2523
01:56:22.411 --> 01:56:27.411
<v Speaker 3>after that fight was flying back with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana White and he said he was just </v>

2524
01:56:27.411 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 3>shaking his head going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's ever done that to me before.</v>

2525
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think anybody could do that.</v>

2526
01:56:32.230 --> 01:56:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's ever done that to me before.</v>

2527
01:56:33.691 --> 01:56:36.720
<v Speaker 3>That was humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the guy's an alien,</v>

2528
01:56:37.410 --> 01:56:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

2529
01:56:38.201 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 3>that kind of devastation that Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 3>can put on you.</v>

2530
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:47.510
<v Speaker 3>You look at the mountain ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing to get to the level of </v>

2531
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 3>proficiency that you saw him exhibit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you go,</v>

2532
01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get there.</v>

2533
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My body doesn't move like that.</v>

2534
01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.980
<v Speaker 3>There's certain physical limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that certain people are just.</v>

2535
01:56:59.070 --> 01:57:04.070
<v Speaker 3>They just have and certain fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages that some people just have </v>

2536
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:06.900
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like Jon Jones or you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy like Kevin around them and when he</v>

2537
01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:11.901
<v Speaker 3>was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of my favorites as far as like </v>

2538
01:57:11.901 --> 01:57:12.720
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable athleticism and speed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

2539
01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.840
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Randleman when he was in his prime</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just a.</v>

2540
01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:17.100
<v Speaker 3>his nickname was the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a perfect nickname.</v>

2541
01:57:17.101 --> 01:57:19.650
<v Speaker 3>He was a jump up in both of his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the air.</v>

2542
01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:23.580
<v Speaker 3>It was so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was such a fucking athlete and if you</v>

2543
01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 3>don't have that kind of athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are never going to be able to do the</v>

2544
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 3>stuff that he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't move the way he moves,</v>

2545
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if a guy like Kevin Randleman who is</v>

2546
01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:39.681
<v Speaker 3>this incredible athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicates himself and learns the </v>

2547
01:57:39.681 --> 01:57:44.001
<v Speaker 3>techniques that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva learns and gets to that </v>

2548
01:57:44.001 --> 01:57:48.051
<v Speaker 3>level proficiency and timing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence that Anderson Silva has and </v>

2549
01:57:48.051 --> 01:57:52.491
<v Speaker 3>then another guy tries to get there but </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have the same body as Kevin </v>

2550
01:57:52.491 --> 01:57:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won't be able to compete with Kevin </v>

2551
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's,</v>

2552
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 3>there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the roll of the dice is not even</v>

2553
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:05.150
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets a different hand of cards</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people get to twos and some </v>

2554
01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 3>people like John Jones get four aces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2555
01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:07.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing,</v>

2556
01:58:07.801 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's just the way it is.</v>

2557
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Seems like he's epitomized the body type</v>
<v Speaker 3>for mma.</v>

2558
01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:15.360
<v Speaker 3>You understand that Jon Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2559
01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 3>both are long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

2560
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find that for now you see it in </v>

2561
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:23.000
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it,</v>

2562
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.960
<v Speaker 3>the sports have kind of created a body </v>
<v Speaker 3>type that's ideal.</v>

2563
01:58:24.961 --> 01:58:28.860
<v Speaker 3>And I think with them you're seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>exemplified that extra length,</v>

2564
01:58:28.861 --> 01:58:31.830
<v Speaker 3>that extra snap reaches huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge.</v>

2565
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2566
01:58:32.611 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been short.</v>

2567
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting tall guys was always an issue.</v>

2568
01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:42.110
<v Speaker 3>It was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was always like another thing that </v>

2569
01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get.</v>

2570
01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:42.110
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

2572
01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2573
01:58:42.461 --> 01:58:47.461
<v Speaker 1>and developing timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about shorter guys don't like </v>

2574
01:58:47.670 --> 01:58:52.670
<v Speaker 1>guys like Tyson showed that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of benefit to pink shorts</v>

2575
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.440
<v Speaker 1>because they can unload these ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations in fast close quarters </v>

2576
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 1>where you can't sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tall,</v>

2577
01:59:01.241 --> 01:59:06.241
<v Speaker 1>gangly person can't really deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the length of their arms actually </v>

2578
01:59:06.241 --> 01:59:08.680
<v Speaker 1>becomes a disadvantage in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that with Hector Lombard,</v>

2579
01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:13.920
<v Speaker 1>who's a fascinating specimen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not just this ridiculous power </v>

2580
01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.700
<v Speaker 1>puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also this massive,</v>

2581
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>massively talented judo guy with giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

2582
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's like he's this crusher who also </v>
<v Speaker 1>has like the CIC grappling as well.</v>

2583
01:59:23.501 --> 01:59:25.930
<v Speaker 1>So he's not worried about you taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down because most likely you're not</v>

2584
01:59:25.931 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's trying to close the distance and</v>

2585
01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:33.271
<v Speaker 1>drop bombs on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that fight with him and who </v>

2586
01:59:33.271 --> 01:59:33.271
<v Speaker 1>some are porous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2587
01:59:33.271 --> 01:59:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I missed that one.</v>

2588
01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2589
01:59:35.561 --> 01:59:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris is built just like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2590
01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:40.270
<v Speaker 1>just like he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Lombard is like five,</v>

2591
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:45.300
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>185 pounds of solid muscle as is </v>

2592
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:45.300
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both like the same size.</v>

2593
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:49.150
<v Speaker 1>They're all built the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Paul Harris can't crack the way that</v>

2594
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:54.180
<v Speaker 1>hector lumbar can crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hector Lara just teed off on him and </v>

2595
01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.140
<v Speaker 1>stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the.</v>

2596
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:57.670
<v Speaker 1>There's an advantage to that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>body type,</v>

2597
01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>that Hector Lombard style body type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a bigger advantage </v>

2598
02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>to the John Jones Anderson Silva type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're always be room for Tyson.</v>

2599
02:00:05.171 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Tyson created himself into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstoppable force.</v>

2600
02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching him train the old tyson </v>

2601
02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:15.031
<v Speaker 1>training videos are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just how he would perfect that torque </v>

2602
02:00:15.031 --> 02:00:18.361
<v Speaker 1>and that slip and then movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like uncorking the most powerful </v>

2603
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>force from the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every part of his muscles working </v>

2604
02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:26.191
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was throwing those hooks and </v>

2605
02:00:26.191 --> 02:00:26.191
<v Speaker 1>upper cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way his body was moving,</v>

2606
02:00:26.191 --> 02:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>he made himself into an unstoppable </v>
<v Speaker 1>force for awhile and then you know,</v>

2607
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>that petered out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody could still do that.</v>

2608
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>There was also the intensity to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery that we had never seen before.</v>

2609
02:00:36.570 --> 02:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Then the Tyson era before Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were looking at guys like Tony tubs </v>

2610
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>and Pink Land Thomas and really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2611
02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say this with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespect,</v>

2612
02:00:44.471 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's no other way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

2613
02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>they were lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just guys who were just.</v>

2614
02:00:49.410 --> 02:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2615
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>they really had no business being at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the heap in any other sport.</v>

2616
02:00:53.770 --> 02:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have been at the top of </v>

2617
02:00:58.770 --> 02:01:00.751
<v Speaker 1>the heap in basketball like pink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pink and Thomas wouldn't have been an </v>

2618
02:01:00.751 --> 02:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>all star nfl running back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have that kind of discipline.</v>

2619
02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't that kind of fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Tyson was so he came along in this </v>

2620
02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:11.341
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were slacking and here's a </v>

2621
02:01:11.341 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>guy who it in work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up at 5:00</v>

2622
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and do my jogging and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why I do my running at that time,</v>

2623
02:01:14.511 --> 02:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's because I know that no one else has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awake at that time.</v>

2624
02:01:17.230 --> 02:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember him saying that and he will </v>
<v Speaker 1>give me an extra inch.</v>

2625
02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember like thinking like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is trying to get edges everywhere he</v>

2626
02:01:24.161 --> 02:01:29.161
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting up earlier than anybody </v>

2627
02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>running and he seemed running in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark and he just looked like a muscle,</v>

2628
02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>just like a corded muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

2629
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>He was built like unlike any heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>before him,</v>

2630
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>except like he was like a bigger version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like Joe Frazier,</v>

2631
02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2632
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 3>a much more muscular version of Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Frazier,</v>

2633
02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:44.960
<v Speaker 3>but much faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much faster,</v>

2634
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:46.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his,</v>

2635
02:01:46.881 --> 02:01:50.030
<v Speaker 3>his ability to deliver punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with speed,</v>

2636
02:01:50.210 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 3>like there's a video of him hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy bag.</v>

2637
02:01:52.730 --> 02:01:57.730
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most ridiculous things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever seen in your life because </v>

2638
02:01:57.730 --> 02:02:00.521
<v Speaker 3>he's hitting it like a flyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No heavyweights did that at the time.</v>

2639
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 3>No one unleashed those kinds of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2640
02:02:03.411 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 3>six punch combinations in satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two seconds.</v>

2641
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:11.530
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy who came along and just </v>

2642
02:02:11.530 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's operating at 70 Rpms.</v>

2643
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to a thousand.</v>

2644
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:15.330
<v Speaker 3>See if he can keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I think they're probably about 10 or</v>

2650

2817
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:36.810
<v Speaker 3>species of spider.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's found in the pam bore pata t a,</v>

2819
02:10:42.621 --> 02:10:47.621
<v Speaker 3>m b o Pata,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pa Ta Tambo Tambo Potter Research Center</v>

2820
02:10:48.921 --> 02:10:50.900
<v Speaker 3>in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>

2821
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:55.960
<v Speaker 3>they make a decoy out of leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead dead bug parts and other scraps.</v>

2822
02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:00.470
<v Speaker 3>And they piece together an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>spider.</v>

2824
02:11:02.751 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Spider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good fucking question.</v>

2825
02:11:05.230 --> 02:11:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Something has to be trying to jacket or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're setting themselves up as bait</v>

2826
02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:11.630
<v Speaker 3>to reinforce is so fucked though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume that nothing's safe.</v>

2827
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I think everything gets jacked in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forest.</v>

2828
02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2829
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's safe</v>

2830
02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:24.010
<v Speaker 10>really happened on that Thursday here to</v>
<v Speaker 10>Augusta high school that led to Chris </v>

2831
02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:27.880
<v Speaker 10>Woods.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Deck contrast propped up town country as</v>

2832
02:11:36.711 --> 02:11:41.711
<v Speaker 10>fucked up town because a bug flew in and</v>
<v Speaker 10>please get the fuck out this country.</v>

2833
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 10>My little fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2834
02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Got Real real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fake news.</v>

2835
02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Caster voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2836
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Those people I think are the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>perverts because I think it's a lot like</v>

2837
02:12:04.101 --> 02:12:09.101
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not based on any research </v>

2838
02:12:09.101 --> 02:12:09.101
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking out my ass.</v>

2839
02:12:09.101 --> 02:12:13.660
<v Speaker 3>But I think if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that allow those dudes </v>

2840
02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:15.260
<v Speaker 3>are perverted because of the same reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>why Catholic priests become perverted.</v>

2841
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:17.580
<v Speaker 3>You tell them they can't fuck ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2842
02:12:17.581 --> 02:12:22.581
<v Speaker 3>Then they get suppressed and like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell these people they can't behave </v>

2843
02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:22.581
<v Speaker 3>nutty ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

2844
02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>they go off the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a restricting other emotions </v>

2845
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe they're just really.</v>

2846
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:29.820
<v Speaker 3>They just lose their fucking temper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lose their cool.</v>

2847

2895
02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:43.620
<v Speaker 1>in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found a group of spiders that acts </v>

2896
02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>as a pack first time they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed this,</v>

2923
02:16:02.190 --> 02:16:07.190
<v Speaker 6>like a flying squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to find so much shit </v>

2924
02:16:07.190 --> 02:16:10.400
<v Speaker 6>underwater to the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa mighty as far as to bitch is not </v>

2927
02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:23.320
<v Speaker 11>Walking all these spiders fight as </v>
<v Speaker 11>creepy enough.</v>

2928
02:16:23.710 --> 02:16:28.710
<v Speaker 11>Put these communal spiders leaving </v>
<v Speaker 11>groups of up to 1500 single giant web.</v>

2929
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:36.360
<v Speaker 11>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's so fucked her.</v>

<v Speaker 11>Whenever you want to come over here and </v>

2931
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.711
<v Speaker 11>take to the nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Look at what happens when they get </v>

2932
02:16:45.711 --> 02:16:48.900
<v Speaker 11>something.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They just all swarm and oh,</v>

<v Speaker 11>fucking going for a neutral spine is </v>

2935
02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 11>working together like this.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It makes sense here in the underworld as</v>

2936
02:17:03.641 --> 02:17:07.150
<v Speaker 11>whips are often destroyed by rain </v>
<v Speaker 11>falling debris,</v>

2937
02:17:07.710 --> 02:17:12.710
<v Speaker 11>animals charging through spiders do </v>
<v Speaker 11>loose if their web repairs at night and </v>

2938

2943
02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:28.551
<v Speaker 4>this guy trying to capture a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>spider in Australia on the wall and he </v>

2944
02:17:28.551 --> 02:17:33.081
<v Speaker 4>has like this tupperware and a helmet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes to put it on the thing and </v>

<v Speaker 4>the thing just jumps right at his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

2946
02:17:34.591 --> 02:17:37.380

<v Speaker 4>That was some spooky shit too.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's not real and I guess he just </v>

2950
02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:51.130
<v Speaker 6>starts freaking out.</v>

2951
02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:55.220
<v Speaker 5>I think I would kill him.</v>

2952
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:58.850
<v Speaker 6>Probably Sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever seen a spider on acid?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>

2954
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:06.220
<v Speaker 6>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's animated,</v>

2955
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:08.260
<v Speaker 6>but I dunno if it's cocaine,</v>

02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:16.680

<v Speaker 8>that it's cocaine.</v>

2960
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:22.030
<v Speaker 8>If you had that much coke,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the last thing you'd want to do is </v>

2961
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.220
<v Speaker 8>experiment with spiders,</v>

<v Speaker 8>You'd go,</v>

2963
02:18:23.841 --> 02:18:25.730
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe that's guys got real coke,</v>

2964
02:18:27.090 --> 02:18:29.690
<v Speaker 8>which is just a spider like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:18:29.691 --> 02:18:31.720
<v Speaker 8>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a youtube video called spiders</v>

2966
02:18:31.890 --> 02:18:36.890
<v Speaker 12>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which I believe they back in the day </v>

2967
02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:38.640
<v Speaker 12>that gave acid inspires the Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what?</v>

2968
02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:42.900
<v Speaker 13>The spider is the most accomplished of </v>
<v Speaker 13>all web building species.</v>

2969
02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:49.580
<v Speaker 13>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 13>scientists gave these tiny creatures a </v>

2970
02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:51.840
<v Speaker 13>variety of psychoactive drugs to observe</v>
<v Speaker 13>their effects on web building.</v>

2971
02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:58.340
<v Speaker 13>When given a minute dose of Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the spider's Web took on an unfamiliar </v>

2972
02:18:59.010 --> 02:19:03.480
<v Speaker 13>minimalist structure that didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 13>much work done when given caffeine,</v>

2973
02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:08.780
<v Speaker 13>the web structure was not affected,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but the spiders behavior was whoa.</v>

2974
02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:14.340
<v Speaker 13>Given thc the active ingredient in </v>
<v Speaker 13>marijuana,</v>

2975
02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.880
<v Speaker 13>the spider didn't build a web.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It built a hammock where it lay all day </v>

2976
02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:22.860
<v Speaker 13>and watch the caffeine spider go,</v>

2977
02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 8>that Shit's not true.</v>

2978
02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:34.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just fuck people over with this </v>

2979
02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:34.060
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so wrong,</v>

2980
02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:35.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

2981
02:19:35.841 --> 02:19:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2982
02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:41.900
<v Speaker 13>I think there really was.</v>
<v Speaker 13>There really was a test called cane </v>

2983
02:19:42.211 --> 02:19:44.960
<v Speaker 13>spider.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Figured building webs was for soccer,</v>

2984
02:19:45.690 --> 02:19:48.360
<v Speaker 13>waited until the caffeine spider was </v>
<v Speaker 13>exhausted.</v>

2985
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 13>Then came up behind it and pop the cap </v>
<v Speaker 13>and it's asked Mr Krzak spider spider </v>

2986
02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:04.791
<v Speaker 13>had no place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It ended up in the crack web as the </v>

2987
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:08.130
<v Speaker 13>crack spiders bitch for more information</v>
<v Speaker 13>on the crack spiders.</v>

2988
02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:10.080
<v Speaker 13>That's so funny.</v>

2989
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:15.230
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about this study that </v>

2990
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:18.231
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do at Harvard medical </v>

2991
02:20:18.231 --> 02:20:20.871
<v Speaker 1>school is looking for an adventurous </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who's willing to give birth to a </v>

2992
02:20:21.001 --> 02:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2993
02:20:23.730 --> 02:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>This is there really going to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal from.</v>

2994
02:20:27.631 --> 02:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make out of fucking human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2995
02:20:30.271 --> 02:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do like Jurassic Park style.</v>

2996
02:20:32.851 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 1>They find an old bone and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get some DNA out of there and well,</v>

2997
02:20:36.210 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what's really bananas is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually creating a life that is </v>

2998
02:20:42.031 --> 02:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>essentially a type of human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2999
02:20:45.121 --> 02:20:47.550
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals are essentially a type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

3000
02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the.</v>

3001
02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the definition.</v>

3002
02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not homosapien,</v>

3003
02:20:54.390 --> 02:20:55.830
<v Speaker 1>but they are a type of human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3004
02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that like Homo Floresiensis?</v>

3005
02:20:57.991 --> 02:20:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Are they a type of human?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3006
02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Are they a type of primate?</v>

3007
02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:03.030
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had to cross that bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't come up yet.</v>

3008
02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:08.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far back do we still have to give </v>

3009
02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:09.120
<v Speaker 1>them the rights of people or should we </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them the rights of people?</v>

3010
02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.920
<v Speaker 1>We should treat all animals with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>

3011
02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but you know how far back in the species</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain do we declare somebody assenting </v>

3012
02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:17.970
<v Speaker 1>it being well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3013
02:21:17.971 --> 02:21:22.971
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with this thing and you </v>

3014
02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:23.520
<v Speaker 1>allow it to go into society and mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you allow it to have a life?</v>

3015
02:21:23.521 --> 02:21:25.620
<v Speaker 1>What if you make a male and it starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping?</v>

3016
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:30.710
<v Speaker 1>What if it goes in the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it goes into the UFC or GEICO </v>

3017
02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's five feet tall?</v>

3018
02:21:33.570 --> 02:21:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what neanderthals.</v>

3019
02:21:35.641 --> 02:21:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Wade and just chimp strong because </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals by the way,</v>

3020
02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:42.240
<v Speaker 1>had bone structure that was completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than ours.</v>

3021
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bones were much thicker,</v>

3022
02:21:44.761 --> 02:21:46.560
<v Speaker 1>much heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3023
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:48.990
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were literally five feet tall,</v>

3024
02:21:48.991 --> 02:21:52.020
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds and that's just different.</v>

3025
02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.060
<v Speaker 1>They're built different than human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

3026
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:59.990
<v Speaker 1>What would that would they allow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be a whole new set of Nevada </v>

3027
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:01.830
<v Speaker 1>State Athletic Commission?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things in our society would get</v>

3028
02:22:02.010 --> 02:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>really kind of weird if there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>another set of and b.</v>

3029
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you see district nine or did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it?</v>

3030
02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

3031
02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty interesting what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to do.</v>

3032
02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:18.620
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen as a science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie about this alien spacecrafts </v>

3033
02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:18.620
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there supposed to be more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

3034
02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to do another one.</v>

3035
02:22:19.711 --> 02:22:24.711
<v Speaker 1>They were going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They left room at the end of it for a </v>

3036
02:22:24.711 --> 02:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the science.</v>

3037
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Cgi</v>

3038
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:31.010
<v Speaker 3>animation gotten good enough where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could make a realistic movie about </v>

3039
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:36.441
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these aliens living amongst people and </v>

3040
02:22:36.441 --> 02:22:38.601
<v Speaker 3>the way they did it was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty cool about how they just </v>

3041
02:22:38.601 --> 02:22:41.631
<v Speaker 3>sort of assimilated in sort of became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of life here on earth that people </v>

3042
02:22:41.631 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 3>just dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that these,</v>

3043
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:43.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they call them?</v>

3044
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:48.830
<v Speaker 3>They called them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had some fucking creepy name for </v>

3045
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.830
<v Speaker 3>them that pissed them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3046
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:53.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if they went a hold and went </v>

3047
02:22:53.501 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 3>and went ahead rather and did this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>created neanderthals,</v>

3048
02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:58.680
<v Speaker 3>we might find out why neanderthals are </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinct,</v>

3049
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:00.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might've killed them off.</v>

3050
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very possible that human beings </v>

3051
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:07.140
<v Speaker 3>killed them off because we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what their behavior was like.</v>

3052
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:10.680
<v Speaker 3>But we do know what the behavior of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of other primates is.</v>

3053
02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Like we know how fucking ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees ruthless baboons are.</v>

3054
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:20.120
<v Speaker 3>What if we know how ruthless people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know how ruthless Homo Sapiens </v>

3055
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:22.080
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals and take it to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

3056
02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:27.320
<v Speaker 3>What are the fucking baby and psychos </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we found evidence of of </v>

3057
02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:33.500
<v Speaker 3>cannibalism on a lot of human corpses </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they think might have been either a</v>

3058
02:23:35.431 --> 02:23:39.270
<v Speaker 3>result of homosapiens or neanderthals </v>
<v Speaker 3>prey Predator,</v>

3059
02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:43.260
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals going after people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there might've been like humans</v>

3060
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:46.530
<v Speaker 3>hunting humans in the nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting people or people hunting them.</v>

3061
02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:52.250
<v Speaker 3>They also know that it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that talked about with the Steve </v>

3062
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The native Americans were rampant,</v>

3063
02:23:53.911 --> 02:23:57.360
<v Speaker 3>cannibals and a lot of parts of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country for show or for me,</v>

3064
02:23:57.390 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3065
02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially the Great Lakes area.</v>

3066
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Apparently Great Lakes area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were known for catching people and </v>

3067
02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:10.010
<v Speaker 3>eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that's always </v>

3068
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:12.021
<v Speaker 3>difficult when you look at these </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures that you revere because I </v>

3069
02:24:12.021 --> 02:24:13.350
<v Speaker 3>certainly revere a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>native American spirituality and certain</v>

3070
02:24:13.351 --> 02:24:15.720
<v Speaker 3>things about Mezo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American spirituality as well,</v>

3071
02:24:15.930 --> 02:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>but then you see these cultures in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>peak doing things like human sacrifice </v>

3072
02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:21.920
<v Speaker 3>cannibalism or weird things and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3073
02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't quite there yet at some good </v>

3074
02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>principles.</v>

3075
02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:32.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were still ripping people's hearts </v>

3076
02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:32.170
<v Speaker 3>out to please the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

3077
02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3078
02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:38.380
<v Speaker 3>the creation of the temple of Tlt will </v>
<v Speaker 3>con is that said the Aztec temple where </v>

3079
02:24:39.091 --> 02:24:42.000
<v Speaker 3>they killed 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in four days.</v>

3080
02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:44.760
<v Speaker 3>They sacrificed something like 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3081
02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:48.390
<v Speaker 3>They were all prisoners essentially that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use to build the temple.</v>

3082
02:24:48.610 --> 02:24:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Then once they were done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3083
02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:50.280
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

3084
02:24:50.730 --> 02:24:53.960
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna fucking kill you all now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that we,</v>

3085
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:59.030
<v Speaker 3>now that we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like on one hand you have this </v>

3086
02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:01.911
<v Speaker 3>amazing society that's capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating such a magnificent structure </v>

3087
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:05.580
<v Speaker 3>like this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic Aztec temple.</v>

3088
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:10.870
<v Speaker 3>But the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also capable of killing </v>

3089
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody that helped build it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut their fucking hearts out,</v>

3090
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:12.930
<v Speaker 3>chuck and them down a flight of stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>stairs,</v>

3091
02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 3>thump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thump,</v>

3092
02:25:13.890 --> 02:25:14.550
<v Speaker 3>thump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thump,</v>

3093
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:15.690
<v Speaker 3>thump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next,</v>

3094
02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.370
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Dan Dodi,</v>

3095
02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:20.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys that was working on that</v>

3096
02:25:20.131 --> 02:25:22.620
<v Speaker 3>media to show with me when we were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>over this.</v>

3097
02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about how crazy those </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers are.</v>

3098
02:25:24.191 --> 02:25:29.191
<v Speaker 3>He did a calculation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you have to kill someone every </v>

3099
02:25:29.191 --> 02:25:29.460
<v Speaker 3>13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massive,</v>

3100
02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:35.240
<v Speaker 3>massive obsidian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city and knives and stab their </v>

3101
02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:41.460
<v Speaker 3>fucking hack in your head off with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stone ax and they're killing someone </v>

3102
02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:42.880
<v Speaker 3>every 13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's intense.</v>

3103
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:48.610
<v Speaker 3>This doctor has a really crazy ideal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>outlook on this to sort of justify.</v>

3104
02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:50.950
<v Speaker 3>You can tell that this guy wants to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3105
02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 3>This is one of his goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't of his quotes.</v>

3106
02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:57.760
<v Speaker 3>If you become a monoculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are at great risk of perishing.</v>

3107
02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recreation of neanderthals would be </v>

3108
02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:03.460
<v Speaker 3>mainly a question of societal risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoidance.</v>

3109
02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:08.820
<v Speaker 3>So he's saying that it would benefit the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human race to reincorporate neanderthals</v>

3110
02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:11.170
<v Speaker 3>into our population.</v>

3111
02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:14.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3112
02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:16.930
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what they're like?</v>

3113
02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:22.340
<v Speaker 3>They are way more primitive than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where words this accepting that </v>

3114
02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.430
<v Speaker 3>physically they're way more dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>

3115
02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:28.120
<v Speaker 3>They probably would beat us in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their bones are thicker,</v>

3116
02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:31.720
<v Speaker 3>much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet if we could outsmart them,</v>

3117
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had bigger brains than us.</v>

3118
02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we won.</v>

3119
02:26:35.530 --> 02:26:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why did we win?</v>

3120
02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Did we win because we're the more evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3121
02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.740
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what the hell was.</v>

3122
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why we got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just figure it out.</v>

3123
02:26:44.161 --> 02:26:49.161
<v Speaker 3>I think we're more clever than them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's also evidence that </v>

3124
02:26:49.161 --> 02:26:49.690
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals had figured out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that we figured out,</v>

3125
02:26:49.930 --> 02:26:54.930
<v Speaker 3>like tool making and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't figure out the Internet </v>

3126
02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:54.930
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have guns.</v>

3127
02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3128
02:26:57.341 --> 02:27:02.341
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're on a path towards more </v>

3129
02:27:02.341 --> 02:27:04.831
<v Speaker 3>clever and more spiritually enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very divergent path that has </v>

3130
02:27:04.831 --> 02:27:09.361
<v Speaker 3>big errors and big fuck ups and big </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminal nodes that really aren't going </v>

3131
02:27:09.361 --> 02:27:09.550
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

3132
02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're just going to have people </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

3133
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Were the cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we won and where the cuts and the </v>

3134
02:27:16.090 --> 02:27:19.820
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals have won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were like way cooler than us </v>

3135
02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:21.970
<v Speaker 3>and they were just overwhelmed them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>continuous and maybe you're all the shit</v>

3136
02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:26.971
<v Speaker 3>that we point to as like problems in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>society could all be avoided if we went </v>

3137
02:27:26.971 --> 02:27:29.920
<v Speaker 3>back to being the anatomic one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the triumph of evil ever.</v>

3138
02:27:29.921 --> 02:27:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Get on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3139
02:27:30.371 --> 02:27:35.371
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that neanderthals might think </v>

3140
02:27:35.371 --> 02:27:39.121
<v Speaker 3>differently than we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know they have a larger cranial size </v>

3141
02:27:39.121 --> 02:27:39.430
<v Speaker 3>and they could even be more intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>

3142
02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

3143
02:27:40.631 --> 02:27:45.631
<v Speaker 3>I never heard anybody say that when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time comes to deal with an epidemic of </v>

3144
02:27:45.631 --> 02:27:49.111
<v Speaker 3>getting off the planet or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's conceivable that their way of </v>

3145
02:27:49.111 --> 02:27:49.111
<v Speaker 3>thinking could be beneficial.</v>

3146
02:27:49.111 --> 02:27:53.080
<v Speaker 3>This guy's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their way of thinking.</v>

3147
02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:56.430
<v Speaker 3>He wants to raise a fucking civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>of neanderthals.</v>

3148
02:27:56.470 --> 02:28:00.250
<v Speaker 3>He wants to bring this guy probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>masturbates to pictures of balls.</v>

3149
02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:05.970
<v Speaker 3>He's probably a freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's asking a woman to give birth </v>

3150
02:28:05.970 --> 02:28:08.470
<v Speaker 3>to a fucking new kind of monkey or a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3151
02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.760
<v Speaker 3>If it's not a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're humans Homosapien,</v>

3152
02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:13.060
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the case?</v>

3153
02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:18.380
<v Speaker 3>So what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So neonatologists another type of </v>

3154
02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:18.380
<v Speaker 3>primate or is another type of is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another?</v>

3155
02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:20.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a different chain.</v>

3156
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I think as far as I recall,</v>

3157
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:27.310
<v Speaker 4>and this is a little vague,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was a different chain of </v>

3158
02:28:27.310 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>evolution where that when terminated in </v>
<v Speaker 4>neanderthal and another one,</v>

3159
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:31.280
<v Speaker 4>all the homo erectus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Homo Sapiens,</v>

3160
02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:34.250
<v Speaker 4>they all went on another evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>chain.</v>

3161
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:39.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a direct link,</v>

3162
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:40.460
<v Speaker 4>but I dunno.</v>

3163
02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:42.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno either.</v>

3164
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:45.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting to think about though.</v>

3165
02:28:45.341 --> 02:28:47.240
<v Speaker 4>And it also gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3166
02:28:47.470 --> 02:28:50.340
<v Speaker 4>the minute you introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in more advanced cultures,</v>

3167
02:28:50.350 --> 02:28:55.350
<v Speaker 4>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there were an alien culture that </v>

3168
02:28:55.350 --> 02:28:56.230
<v Speaker 4>would come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of chaos that would cause,</v>

3169
02:28:56.231 --> 02:29:01.231
<v Speaker 4>particularly in the religious structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things would be earth shaking.</v>

3170
02:29:01.810 --> 02:29:06.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean the whole tenants of all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we are created in God's image </v>

3171
02:29:06.810 --> 02:29:07.470
<v Speaker 4>perfectly blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

3172
02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:10.090
<v Speaker 4>That and then you have someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>smarter,</v>

3173
02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:11.920
<v Speaker 4>Cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>badder than us,</v>

3174
02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:13.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then how does,</v>

3175
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:16.330
<v Speaker 4>how do you rectify that with all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>major religions?</v>

3176
02:29:16.331 --> 02:29:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be the biggest.</v>

3177
02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:21.460
<v Speaker 4>There would be a huge upheaval if that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

3178
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:23.530
<v Speaker 4>Massive chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:29:23.531 --> 02:29:24.940
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man.</v>

3180
02:29:26.050 --> 02:29:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Have you google neanderthal profile of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>super predator.</v>

3181
02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:36.030
<v Speaker 3>This is one a widely discounted and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should say this widely discounted </v>

3182
02:29:36.521 --> 02:29:37.990
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

3183
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:42.480
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of fun to talk about it.</v>

3184
02:29:42.610 --> 02:29:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Neanderthal poor profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3185
02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:54.740
<v Speaker 3>what did I google profile of a monster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The profile of the Super Predator.</v>

3186
02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:00.670
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3187
02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 3>this guy had this idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vision that we had of neanderthals </v>

3188
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:08.130
<v Speaker 3>looking just like us was really based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

3189
02:30:08.131 --> 02:30:13.131
<v Speaker 3>We don't have any actual neanderthal </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies were putting skin on them and </v>

3190
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:18.050
<v Speaker 3>recreating them with clay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would we do this and make it </v>

3191
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:22.341
<v Speaker 3>look like that when we might want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it look like a gorilla or a champ </v>

3192
02:30:22.341 --> 02:30:24.860
<v Speaker 3>or a profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Predator.</v>

3193
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Look up videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy video.</v>

3194
02:30:27.010 --> 02:30:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Go to video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube.</v>

3195
02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:34.620
<v Speaker 3>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you put butthole or Mexican in </v>

3196
02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:34.620
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you getting all these,</v>

3197
02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:36.220
<v Speaker 3>this mustache yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

3198
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:38.410
<v Speaker 3>How are you getting this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3199
02:30:38.411 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 3>that's not neanderthals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google did it.</v>

3200
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thyra.</v>

3201
02:30:43.210 --> 02:30:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you need.</v>

3202
02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:50.740
<v Speaker 3>It's just any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a looking mustache and a n,</v>

3203
02:30:51.310 --> 02:30:53.530
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e r t h a l.</v>

3204
02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:57.210
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Click on the first one.</v>

3205
02:30:57.450 --> 02:31:00.180
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go full screen on this bitch.</v>

3206
02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 10>So the car,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the accepted view of what the look like.</v>

3207
02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:10.730
<v Speaker 10>A big hairy than us and with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 10>those and think thicker brow ridges.</v>

3208
02:31:11.170 --> 02:31:13.490
<v Speaker 10>But apart from that there are </v>
<v Speaker 10>unquestionably human.</v>

3209
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:19.600
<v Speaker 10>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's been said that if you gave the </v>

3210
02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:19.710
<v Speaker 10>Neanderthal to shape the head count and </v>
<v Speaker 10>dressed him up in a nice suit,</v>

3211
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:23.790
<v Speaker 10>he can easily attend Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 10>although it named rich parents.</v>

3212
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:26.430
<v Speaker 10>There's a couple of things wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 10>this picture.</v>

3213
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:29.310
<v Speaker 10>First,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's not based on any sound,</v>

3214
02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:33.420
<v Speaker 10>archaeological evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's because soft tissue features like</v>

3215
02:31:33.450 --> 02:31:38.450
<v Speaker 10>skin hair,</v>
<v Speaker 10>color and non preserved the undertone.</v>

3216
02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:43.860
<v Speaker 10>The other reason is that after studying </v>
<v Speaker 10>the end of those for 10 years,</v>

3217
02:31:44.130 --> 02:31:46.620
<v Speaker 10>I'm convinced they look nothing like </v>
<v Speaker 10>this at all.</v>

3218
02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:50.100
<v Speaker 10>I've only been remaining or throw them </v>
<v Speaker 10>at us here on the end,</v>

3219
02:31:50.101 --> 02:31:52.110
<v Speaker 10>the thought predation created modern </v>
<v Speaker 10>humans.</v>

3220
02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:57.680
<v Speaker 10>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to draw on the latest </v>

3221
02:31:57.680 --> 02:31:59.540
<v Speaker 10>archeological,</v>
<v Speaker 10>genetic and forensic evidence to </v>

3222
02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:01.020
<v Speaker 10>challenge our assumptions about what </v>
<v Speaker 10>neanderthals look like.</v>

3223
02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:07.700
<v Speaker 3>It looks like something we should make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kettle bell.</v>

3224
02:32:11.470 --> 02:32:16.470
<v Speaker 10>You can see examples of this enter </v>
<v Speaker 10>promoting bias in television </v>

3225
02:32:16.470 --> 02:32:17.830
<v Speaker 10>documentaries and in museum </v>
<v Speaker 10>reconstructions around the world.</v>

3226
02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:21.220
<v Speaker 10>Men are sometimes showers quite </v>
<v Speaker 10>handsome.</v>

3227
02:32:21.250 --> 02:32:25.390
<v Speaker 10>We just want to get to try it back </v>
<v Speaker 10>there.</v>

3228
02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:30.440
<v Speaker 10>We and some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I believe that neanderthal males so </v>

3229
02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:38.611
<v Speaker 10>began hunting human females mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 10>really size.</v>

3230
02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 10>It really makes me mad of sexual and </v>
<v Speaker 10>cannibalistic predation went on for an </v>

3231
02:32:46.361 --> 02:32:48.190
<v Speaker 10>excess of $50,000.</v>

3232
02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you had one of those coming </v>

3233
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.270
<v Speaker 3>after Mrs Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo Man.</v>

3234
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if we were you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We recreate this thing and it does come </v>

3235
02:32:57.590 --> 02:33:00.861
<v Speaker 3>out looking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this woman gives birth is </v>

3236
02:33:00.861 --> 02:33:00.861
<v Speaker 3>neanderthal and it comes out looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an ape.</v>

3237
02:33:00.970 --> 02:33:05.970
<v Speaker 3>It really tests them are fucked up black</v>
<v Speaker 3>face with big gigantic teeth and knows </v>

3238
02:33:06.551 --> 02:33:11.551
<v Speaker 3>how to use spears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this guy is like really quacky </v>

3239
02:33:11.551 --> 02:33:12.270
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he is Australian,</v>

3240
02:33:12.271 --> 02:33:14.320
<v Speaker 3>which makes them extra quacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3241
02:33:14.450 --> 02:33:19.450
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of like super experts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people take seriously that top </v>

3242
02:33:19.450 --> 02:33:20.280
<v Speaker 3>light that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except for grandma on the bush,</v>

3243
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:23.220
<v Speaker 3>he's English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but English is completely different.</v>

3244
02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:25.920
<v Speaker 3>If you have English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sell things that people wouldn't</v>

3245
02:33:25.921 --> 02:33:30.921
<v Speaker 3>ordinarily buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like cooking where if you have like an </v>

3246
02:33:30.921 --> 02:33:30.921
<v Speaker 3>English salesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:33:30.921 --> 02:33:32.310
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Australian,</v>

3248
02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:37.370
<v Speaker 3>unless you're selling boomerangs or some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a crocodile gun,</v>

3249
02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to listen to Australian</v>

3250
02:33:40.071 --> 02:33:40.280
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3251
02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:42.180
<v Speaker 3>He's just there to fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving,</v>

3252
02:33:42.181 --> 02:33:47.181
<v Speaker 3>carefree people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not really the right are </v>

3253
02:33:47.181 --> 02:33:50.420
<v Speaker 3>archeologists are the right people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what a fucking neanderthal </v>

3254
02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:51.120
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least the way we want them to be.</v>

3255
02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if this is bullshit.</v>

3256
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's widely widely been </v>

3257
02:33:59.570 --> 02:34:02.510
<v Speaker 3>discredited the aquatic ape theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had me for about an hour and a </v>

3258
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.510
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3259
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3260
02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:08.360
<v Speaker 3>There's a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're wondering why human beings are </v>

3261
02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:11.241
<v Speaker 3>so fatty when we're babies as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>other primates which come out like </v>

3262
02:34:11.241 --> 02:34:12.930
<v Speaker 3>champs when they're babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come out and they're looking.</v>

3263
02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 3>They look pretty rugged like right out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the gate.</v>

3264
02:34:15.331 --> 02:34:16.140
<v Speaker 3>They got sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3265
02:34:16.141 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a lot of body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people were like</v>

3266
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:23.190
<v Speaker 2>balls of fat and the idea was that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were born to sort of be able to float </v>

3267
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:25.660
<v Speaker 2>around and water and then we lived by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water.</v>

3268
02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:28.360
<v Speaker 2>We were aquatic apes while we did live </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the water.</v>

3269
02:34:28.361 --> 02:34:33.361
<v Speaker 2>When those volcanoes happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was something that the </v>

3270
02:34:33.361 --> 02:34:34.360
<v Speaker 2>genetic bottleneck theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does have some criticisms too,</v>

3271
02:34:34.361 --> 02:34:39.361
<v Speaker 2>but when these volcanoes happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if forced everybody to the only life </v>

3272
02:34:39.361 --> 02:34:43.321
<v Speaker 2>source that was available at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>which was coming out of the ocean is </v>

3273
02:34:43.321 --> 02:34:43.321
<v Speaker 2>those were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were the,</v>

3274
02:34:43.321 --> 02:34:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fish and the seaweed and things that</v>

3275
02:34:45.941 --> 02:34:48.530
<v Speaker 2>were unaffected by the massive climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and the,</v>

3276
02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:53.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit that was in the air that was </v>

3277
02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:53.980
<v Speaker 2>causing people massive death.</v>

3278
02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say even to this day,</v>

3279
02:34:54.511 --> 02:34:56.700
<v Speaker 3>80 percent of the world's population </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives near the water,</v>

3280
02:34:57.450 --> 02:35:00.360
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of fascinating because as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water level rises,</v>

3281
02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.100
<v Speaker 3>if something catastrophic happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

3282
02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:07.380
<v Speaker 3>that really would leave a fucking lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>confused motherfuckers in the middle.</v>

3283
02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:10.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the world.</v>

3284
02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:12.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like say if the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every other part of the world,</v>

3285
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:17.990
<v Speaker 3>everything a thousand miles in each </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction was covered with ocean and </v>

3286
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you're just left with the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

3287
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3288
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Got dudes who know how to make bows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrows.</v>

3289
02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for real.</v>

3290
02:35:26.430 --> 02:35:31.430
<v Speaker 3>If you were left with like South Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if South Dakota was all the humans that </v>

3291
02:35:31.430 --> 02:35:34.060
<v Speaker 3>were above water and everything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

3292
02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you got plenty of food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3293
02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.800
<v Speaker 3>but there's no more internet and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to figure out society from scratch,</v>

3294
02:35:40.980 --> 02:35:43.500
<v Speaker 3>from only the people in South Dakota.</v>

3295
02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Just a total random sampling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough go.</v>

3296
02:35:46.050 --> 02:35:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck away.</v>

3297
02:35:48.151 --> 02:35:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Most of these catastrophic work tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duffy's work though is the smartest,</v>

3298
02:35:52.051 --> 02:35:53.160
<v Speaker 2>the brightest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cleverest.</v>

3299
02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:58.180
<v Speaker 2>They are the ones that ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>surviving or you put a gun in their </v>

3300
02:35:58.180 --> 02:35:59.310
<v Speaker 2>mouth because they don't want to survive</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these fucking dummies trying to</v>

3301
02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:01.050
<v Speaker 2>eat them and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3302
02:36:01.051 --> 02:36:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to just check out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what's next.</v>

3303
02:36:03.450 --> 02:36:08.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a crazy place to go with Pompei </v>

3304
02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:10.580
<v Speaker 2>and you go there and you see when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are frozen and ash like huddling </v>

3305
02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:15.141
<v Speaker 2>with their kids within that just rolled </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and discipline just blew up and </v>

3306
02:36:15.141 --> 02:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>vesuvius rolled in and kicked everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3307
02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Ash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy,</v>

3308
02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:20.880
<v Speaker 2>crazy moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frozen in time.</v>

3309
02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not that long ago either.</v>

3310
02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:25.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3311
02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Remember Mount St Helen's remember when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were younger?</v>

3312
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super young.</v>

3313
02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:30.630
<v Speaker 2>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big one.</v>

3314
02:36:30.631 --> 02:36:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a.</v>

3315
02:36:31.350 --> 02:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>There was a Washington state and a giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>volcano blew off.</v>

3316
02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:38.850
<v Speaker 2>We just don't see enough of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They happen so rarely were like,</v>

3317
02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:40.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3318
02:36:40.201 --> 02:36:45.201
<v Speaker 2>That's what fucking happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was that one in Iceland that </v>

3319
02:36:45.201 --> 02:36:45.201
<v Speaker 2>fucked up air travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3320
02:36:45.201 --> 02:36:47.360
<v Speaker 2>that was a little bit of a baby one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3321
02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

3322
02:36:49.470 --> 02:36:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it has a big brother though that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that one goes off,</v>

3323
02:36:52.650 --> 02:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>then I think the last time that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the water froze,</v>

3324
02:36:55.651 --> 02:36:59.100
<v Speaker 2>like really far up the Mississippi River</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things got really fucked.</v>

3325
02:36:59.101 --> 02:37:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It was like a two year winter crops </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>

3326
02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 2>This was around like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 I think.</v>

3327
02:37:04.050 --> 02:37:09.000
<v Speaker 2>So an Icelandic volcano in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 caused a two year winter in America.</v>

3328
02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just because they put so in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere</v>

3329
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:21.380
<v Speaker 3>that cools everything off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we get a big fan and fix that shit?</v>

3330
02:37:22.270 --> 02:37:24.890
<v Speaker 3>You'd think something right below it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>

3331
02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Push it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another direction with that shine is </v>

3332
02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:29.980
<v Speaker 3>already making the big fan to blow on </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

3333
02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 3>They probably got fans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're launching and space like a fan,</v>

3334
02:37:34.431 --> 02:37:39.431
<v Speaker 3>but with wings and it's going to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>hover fan with a helicopter blade and </v>

3335
02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:45.140
<v Speaker 3>just hovers up there and blows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that any of these ideas </v>

3336
02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:46.320
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3337
02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:51.580
<v Speaker 3>the natural disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one thing that people aren't </v>

3338
02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:51.580
<v Speaker 3>prepared for that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3339
02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:52.400
<v Speaker 3>everybody's worried about the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>collapsing.</v>

3340
02:37:52.401 --> 02:37:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's worried about the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and oh,</v>

3341
02:37:54.561 --> 02:37:57.980
<v Speaker 3>what if a dollar is useless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really should worry about man,</v>

3342
02:37:57.981 --> 02:38:00.440
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking super volcanoes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>asteroids.</v>

3343
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Those are the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

3344
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.800
<v Speaker 3>if a super volcano in Iceland can cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>a two year winter in America,</v>

3345
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:12.070
<v Speaker 3>what happens of yellowstone blows with </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens at that motherfucker takes </v>

3346
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:15.050
<v Speaker 3>off that species extinction time.</v>

3347
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:18.260
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like our society is.</v>

3348
02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It's so dependent upon this state of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere staying the where it is,</v>

3349
02:38:25.701 --> 02:38:30.701
<v Speaker 3>but we have so much evidence shows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it really doesn't last and it changes </v>

3350
02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:31.020
<v Speaker 3>radically all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3351
02:38:31.021 --> 02:38:36.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different parts of the world are </v>

3352
02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:36.021
<v Speaker 3>sometimes covered in ice and then a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years later,</v>

3353
02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:38.210
<v Speaker 3>the tropical rain forest and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

3354
02:38:38.211 --> 02:38:40.370
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you just move and adopt,</v>

3355
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:41.660
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adapt.</v>

3356
02:38:41.661 --> 02:38:46.661
<v Speaker 3>Rather there was a harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a biologist or an astronomer rather </v>

3357
02:38:47.751 --> 02:38:52.751
<v Speaker 3>recently that was saying that he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that he doesn't believe that we </v>

3358
02:38:52.751 --> 02:38:56.000
<v Speaker 3>are a or he does believe rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're unique in that we're.</v>

3359
02:38:56.030 --> 02:39:01.030
<v Speaker 3>We're the only life form possibly in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole world that's like us and that our </v>

3360
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:05.051
<v Speaker 3>situation is so rare with our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have lasted this long protected by </v>

3361
02:39:05.901 --> 02:39:10.901
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the asteroids are hitting Jupiter </v>

3362
02:39:10.901 --> 02:39:12.971
<v Speaker 3>and that our environment has been so </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable for so long that it's allowed </v>

3363
02:39:12.971 --> 02:39:16.701
<v Speaker 3>this crazy explosion of intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation and that the odds of that </v>

3364
02:39:16.701 --> 02:39:20.801
<v Speaker 3>actually happening anywhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world or anywhere else in the universe </v>

3365
02:39:20.801 --> 02:39:20.801
<v Speaker 3>are incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly,</v>

3366
02:39:20.801 --> 02:39:21.170
<v Speaker 3>incredibly rare.</v>

3367
02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.610
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you have to multiply that by an</v>

3368
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:26.280
<v Speaker 4>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>virtually infinite universe.</v>

3369
02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:30.870
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that if you propose that </v>
<v Speaker 4>other species in this virtually infinite</v>

3370
02:39:30.871 --> 02:39:34.960
<v Speaker 4>universe just started a bit earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they evolved to the point where they can</v>

3371
02:39:34.961 --> 02:39:39.961
<v Speaker 4>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are going to be the ones that </v>

3372
02:39:39.961 --> 02:39:39.961
<v Speaker 4>traveled to us prior to us traveling to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them</v>

3373
02:39:39.961 --> 02:39:42.040
<v Speaker 3>and they have legal mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

3374
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they made mushrooms and they put </v>
<v Speaker 3>'em on asteroids and send them our way.</v>

3375
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:47.290
<v Speaker 3>A little helping hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3376
02:39:47.291 --> 02:39:50.470
<v Speaker 3>that scene a little pat on the butt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the theory about how life on this</v>

3377
02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Panspermia Panspermia with mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was another show that I watched.</v>

3378
02:39:57.061 --> 02:40:02.061
<v Speaker 3>It's Morgan Freedman's show through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wormhole where this astrophysicists was </v>

3379
02:40:02.061 --> 02:40:06.751
<v Speaker 3>explaining the infinite in that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe is so big that there are the.</v>

3380
02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:12.270
<v Speaker 3>The odds are that there is an exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>duplicate of you what the exact cells </v>

3381
02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:20.040
<v Speaker 3>and the exact life experiences and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3382
02:40:20.430 --> 02:40:23.460
<v Speaker 3>an infinite number of trillions of miles</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

3383
02:40:23.461 --> 02:40:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even wrap your head around how</v>

3384
02:40:26.671 --> 02:40:31.671
<v Speaker 3>far away it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But infinity is so big that it means </v>

3385
02:40:31.671 --> 02:40:35.871
<v Speaker 3>that the world as it exists today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what the exact adams in the </v>

3386
02:40:36.451 --> 02:40:40.650
<v Speaker 3>exact order that the universe is so big </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it could exist,</v>

3387
02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:45.890
<v Speaker 3>not just exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but exist in so many different forms </v>

3388
02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:49.760
<v Speaker 3>that the exact creation of this earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact events that have taken place </v>

3389
02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.990
<v Speaker 3>all have been recreated on this</v>

3390
02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:55.680
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a.</v>

3391
02:40:55.770 --> 02:40:56.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is.</v>

3392
02:40:56.371 --> 02:41:01.371
<v Speaker 4>I heard that in a different way saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that your actions echo in eternity </v>

3393
02:41:01.371 --> 02:41:06.140
<v Speaker 4>because of that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because everything that you do now will </v>

3394
02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:10.071
<v Speaker 4>be repeated just by the law of infinity </v>
<v Speaker 4>by another you at another point in </v>

3395
02:41:11.281 --> 02:41:15.000
<v Speaker 4>another time period in another universe </v>
<v Speaker 4>or in the same one.</v>

3396
02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:19.200
<v Speaker 4>So it was the idea was that your actions</v>
<v Speaker 4>echo in eternity because those,</v>

3397
02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.500
<v Speaker 4>those impetuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the choices you make will be duplicated </v>

3398
02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 4>in another experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that is crazy.</v>

3399
02:41:26.250 --> 02:41:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the Uber Mind Fuck decision</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe scenario where every decision </v>

3400
02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:35.871
<v Speaker 3>you make branches off and do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely new in independent universe </v>

3401
02:41:35.871 --> 02:41:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and they're all parallel existing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that every time you make a decision for </v>

3402
02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.481
<v Speaker 3>the positive or for the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire universe is restructured </v>

3403
02:41:44.481 --> 02:41:48.621
<v Speaker 3>around you and it's a completely new one</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that will any similarities to the </v>

3404
02:41:48.621 --> 02:41:53.241
<v Speaker 3>previous universe or just just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>similarities that you are existing in </v>

3405
02:41:53.241 --> 02:41:57.741
<v Speaker 3>these new planes that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreated over and over and over again </v>

3406
02:41:57.741 --> 02:42:01.380
<v Speaker 3>and that life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much like we see in when you break the </v>

3407
02:42:02.011 --> 02:42:07.011
<v Speaker 3>world down to subatomic particles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then break it and bring it all the way </v>

3408
02:42:07.011 --> 02:42:10.851
<v Speaker 3>up to universes and galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the universe and it's moments are </v>

3409
02:42:11.581 --> 02:42:16.581
<v Speaker 3>fractal as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are also infinite and that in </v>

3410
02:42:16.581 --> 02:42:17.250
<v Speaker 3>these decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in moments,</v>

3411
02:42:17.251 --> 02:42:22.251
<v Speaker 3>you create infinite universes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get so crazy,</v>

3412
02:42:23.250 --> 02:42:26.700
<v Speaker 3>but the universe itself is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that any crazier?</v>

3413
02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:32.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it any crazier than an infinite </v>

3414
02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:32.850
<v Speaker 3>universe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that any crazier than hundreds of</v>

3415
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:33.250
<v Speaker 3>billions of galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming?</v>

3416
02:42:33.570 --> 02:42:36.690
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't wrap your head around and</v>

3417
02:42:36.691 --> 02:42:37.110
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3418
02:42:37.111 --> 02:42:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I have 150 acres of Oh well fucking whip</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit.</v>

3419
02:42:40.741 --> 02:42:42.930
<v Speaker 3>The Universe is infinite and what's 150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>acres?</v>

3420
02:42:42.931 --> 02:42:43.830
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything</v>

3421
02:42:44.650 --> 02:42:49.650
<v Speaker 4>to explore these topics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember there was a philosophical </v>

3422
02:42:49.650 --> 02:42:52.171
<v Speaker 4>conundrum in which the philosopher says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can prove to you that if I shoot an </v>

3423
02:42:52.171 --> 02:42:55.780
<v Speaker 4>Arrow at a target that it will never hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>the target and here's how they do it.</v>

3424
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:58.570
<v Speaker 4>At a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Arrow would be halfway to the target</v>

3425
02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:01.990
<v Speaker 4>and that takes a certain amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At another point the Arrow will be,</v>

3426
02:43:01.991 --> 02:43:03.430
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you take the next half,</v>

3427
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:05.800
<v Speaker 4>so at a certain that the next half </v>
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

3428
02:43:06.100 --> 02:43:07.870
<v Speaker 4>that will also take a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3429
02:43:08.170 --> 02:43:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Then you take the next half point to </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's halfway to the.</v>

3430
02:43:11.470 --> 02:43:12.190
<v Speaker 4>That'll take another</v>

3431
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:17.190
<v Speaker 2>amount of time while there's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be another half point which is </v>

3432
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:21.751
<v Speaker 2>going to have a time value and so if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a continuous amount of time </v>

3433
02:43:21.751 --> 02:43:26.050
<v Speaker 2>value in the half point of distance </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved by a coworker by whatever,</v>

3434
02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:30.550
<v Speaker 2>infinite a measurement by that logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arrows should never hit the target,</v>

3435
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:32.470
<v Speaker 2>and you start to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3436
02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3437
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some hippie bullshit that hit </v>

3438
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3439
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what we all know has never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowhunting.</v>

3440
02:43:41.930 --> 02:43:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Need to get with Ted nugent and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out your fancy graph and watch this </v>

3441
02:43:46.930 --> 02:43:49.560
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Your theory sucks.</v>

3442
02:43:49.570 --> 02:43:51.340
<v Speaker 2>A fat deck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a dead deer.</v>

3443
02:43:51.430 --> 02:43:56.430
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there used to be in those </v>

3444
02:43:56.430 --> 02:43:56.430
<v Speaker 2>philosophical debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be people,</v>

3445
02:43:56.430 --> 02:43:59.611
<v Speaker 2>especially in the skeptical debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one famous instance where I </v>

3446
02:43:59.611 --> 02:44:01.300
<v Speaker 2>think someone just slap someone in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face that you think you think nothing is</v>

3447
02:44:01.301 --> 02:44:06.301
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about this back and just hit one of </v>

3448
02:44:06.301 --> 02:44:06.520
<v Speaker 2>the skeptics in the face like that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

3449
02:44:06.521 --> 02:44:11.521
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started fucking around with too </v>

3450
02:44:11.521 --> 02:44:11.521
<v Speaker 2>many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever got slapped away.</v>

3451
02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:13.540
<v Speaker 2>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are too many</v>

3452
02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:19.180
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means we're going to wrap this </v>

3453
02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:19.180
<v Speaker 3>bitch up and bring it home.</v>
